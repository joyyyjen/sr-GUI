we are taken off this they remained a week long celebration often landmark events which is the golden anniversary of the ballot in conference on communication go to london to it
so feel will have being a regular attendees at dallas and office for many years and for some probably a pallet than it is special place in new york area and then being presented your first date or or second bigger bigger barrier at the ballot think op was then i know that many of you out there
photos of the new phone this is the very first ballot in conference and then full confidence and then the zen far does this is a historic moment
it's a celebration of that lol the disciplinary a scientific meeting which was launched fifty years ago on november fifty nine is it's it's a with vision an incredible force ah
it was the brainchild of mecca unwelcome work though didn't know what your first call it share the first conference fifty years ago
bill perkins that glorious share mandates that and the new was also involved in the initial discussions and letting go of the golf pros and i believe he is the only one in this room who has witnessed that these are given fifty years ago
that creates as vision was his article like that meant by mac and join in the forward to the proceedings of that first conference
that's a vision was to vote like an opportunity for me searches the present their first new results in a dynamic going to feel and fumbling police chargers in different disciplines together to cultivate coast fertilization of ideas
and this goes i don't target
and thus far reaching vision off its founders is still the guiding light at the eller than fifty years like that
it's it's one of the longest running at conferences that plays that climate where often this isn't very out and it's one of the most is the idiots that
it's perhaps the only it the longest running confidence that has never changed its menu
from the very beginning it is has been out allison also him on the cello illinois
only a minor adjustment was made in going from the first of the second ballot in the office in ninety six civil war which was a little more that they from that show where the mid november so late september which was set them within days of the third year
that's one that the second ballot and dolphins was now so that then then these can enjoy the view full full were there at the house and grounds and it looks like it they some of the base will have that beautiful weather with us this year also
i'm salt bed i'm not sure so what's the eggs then that's that is the fact but then mac actually want it to hold the first day conference in all your room the first week in october because that coincided with that coincided with his birthday which rose although we're the fifth
but the talent and also that the veil that that time and i'm told that was the reason why it was pushed the november than fifty
but then immediately the following year it will vote back to the first wave of the last week in september and since then it has always been out either the last week in september of the first week in october
