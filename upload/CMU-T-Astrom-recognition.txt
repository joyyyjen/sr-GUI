we are cutting off is the running and a week long celebration of a landmark events that led to the golden anniversary of the ballot and conference on conditions on the london to
for those of you who have been regular attendees at balancing conference for many years and for some probably a talent than it is special place in your career when being presented your first paper or second paper in your career at the dollar than confidence and i know that there are many of you out of there
for those of a formal notice of the very first alexander on funds and then fall conference attendees and fog as this is a historic moment
it's a celebration of that lol the discipline and scientific meeting which was launched fifty years ago on november fifteen ninety six and three with vision an incredible force
it was atlanta falcons met them off the mark of the good of a job for us courts at the first conference the years ago
build our cans that glorious here than it does it and the easier it was also involved in the initial discussions and planning off the coffers and i believe he is the lawn lawn in this room or as a witness that is the argument fifty years ago
that creates us vision loss is that the goliath of mad by mac and jaw in the fourth of the proceedings of that first conference the
that vision was to provide an opportunity for researchers to present the first notice all the sudden ignoring feel at a linguist arches in different disciplines that get their took all the cost for the position of ideas
and this was right on target
and thus far reaching vision off his father's he is the limit in black and talent and fifty years later that
it's it's one of the longest running confidence us that plays that but i'm aware of in this isn't a nap and it's one of the most is the years but
it's perhaps the only the longest running confidence that has never changed its venue
from the very beginning it it has been held at the allison house in monticello illinois
only a minor adjustment was amazed been going from the first of the second ballot and confidence in ninety six and four which cost of more than they are from the till en in november to late september or which was set them up and it's a deserted
that's one that the second ballot in the office will sell so that that the andes and enjoyed the fall fall under the alex and arms and it looks black if they some of the visible at that beautiful the wooden with us this year also
an assault that i'm not sure the locks the extent that says is that fact but the mac actually want to double the first day at a conference in all over the first week in all the because that coincided with that coincided with is that it would throw the local up a fifth
but that allison author was not available at the time and that's all that was the reason why it was forced to november the city
but then immediately the following year it was brought back to the first week or the last week in september and since then it has always been held either the last week in september or the first week in october
