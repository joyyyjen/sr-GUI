how are we doing
no no no no but by that i meant how are we homo sapiens we'd as a species
now the typical way to answer that question is this
you choose some measure of human physical well being
average longevity average calories per day average income overall population that sort of thing
and draw a graph of its value over time
in almost every case you get the same result
the lines get along a low-level for millennia and rockets up accidentally in the nineteenth and twentieth century
or choose a measure of consumption
consumption of energy consumption for far as a
and draw graph of its value over time
in the same way the lines because along at a low level for millennia and rockets up exponentially in the nineteenth and twentieth century
biologists have a word for this outbreak
an outbreak is when a population of species exceeds the bounds of natural selection
natural selection ordinarily keeps populations and species within roughly defined limits
s. era sites lack of resources prevent them from expanding too much
but every now and then a species escapes it's bounds
from a porn star fish in the indian ocean zebra mussels and brake lights spurs but we're here in canada
population exploded approval a thousand pull a million people
so here's a fundamental lesson from biology breaks in nature don't end well
but a couple of porn is a big cookie sheet is full of nutrients
natural habitats toilet water
your money constraints that
in a petri dish the ocean roughest and no natural enemies
the key to reproduce in return is a great result that
if it yeah it's a petri dish at what point that brown the wrong way sparked my resources are off
the outbreak man's always that
not from the viewpoint of biology your night are not fundamentally different than a proposal that you get
we're not special
all the things that we are vanity think maybe it's different
art science technology and so forth
the
one outbreak species
when did you dc this simple fact
well the obvious question is actually true
are in fact and if you'd think
but this is satisfaction from a nasty guys another one
if we are going is the biology how did you
in your twenty fifty a week almost ten billion people of the war and i also want the things the human eye out
nice cars nice clothes nice homes yeah come to the iranian
i think a toddler running for ten billion people coming to this
pharmacy it really did want to read by the provide power to rebut avoid the worst impacts of climate change
i'm a science journalist and by the vastness pushes researchers for years
in my experience there is a full into two broad categories of cycle wizards and profits
was it actually says believe that science and technology properly applied to listen to these early on to 'em it's
these are the more they say that point everyone can we
profits legal to be awesome
they see the world is governed by a fundamental ecological prophecies was limits the leaves and grass for peril
use last conserving say
the white everybody's gonna lose
