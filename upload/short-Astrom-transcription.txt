we are kicking off this evening a week-long celebration of a landmark event which is the golden anniversary of the allerton conference on communication control and computing
for those of you who have been regular attendees at the allerton conference for many years and for some probably allerton is special place in your career having presented your first paper or second paper in your career at the allerton conference and i know that there are many of you out there
for those of you for whom this is the very first allerton conference an-and for all conference attendees and for our guests this is a historic moment
it's a celebration of a multi-disciplinary scientific meeting which was launched 50 years ago on november 15 1963 with vision and incredible foresight
it was the brainchild of mac van valkenburg who together with joe cruz co-chaired the first conference 50 years ago
bill perkins eh who is here ehht and eh he was also involved in the initial discussions and planning of the conference and i believe he is the only one in this room who has witnessed that historic event 50 years ago
the creatives' vision was as articulated by mac and joe in the forward to the proceedings of that first conference
that vision was to provide an opportunity for researchers to present their fresh new results in a dynamic growing field and to bring researchers in different disciplines together to cultivate cross-fertilization of ideas
and this was right on target
and this far-reaching vision of its founders is still the guiding light at allerton 50 years later
it's-it's one of the longest running conferences at least that i'm aware of in the systems area and it's one of the most prestigious
it's perhaps the only longest running conference that has never changed its venue
from the very beginning it has been held at the allerton house in monticello illinois
only a minor adjustment was made in going from the first to the second allerton conference in 1964 which was to move the date from the chilly mid november to late september which was september 28th through the 30th
that's when the-the second allerton conference was held so that the attendees can enjoy the beautiful fall weather at the allerton grounds and it looks like at least some of the days we'll have that beautiful weather with us this year also
i'm told eh i'm not sure to what extent that it is a fact but eh mac actually wanted to hold the first eh conference in october the first week in october because that coincided would have coincided with his birth date which was october 5th
but the allerton house was not available at the time and i'm told that was the reason why it was pushed to november the 15th
but then immediately the following year it was brought back to the first week or the last week in september and since then it has always been held either the last week in september or the first week in october
