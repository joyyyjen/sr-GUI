'''Mixlink''' (Mixlink II) is a computer used with [[Agfa]] scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Good Mixture - MIXLINK taken over from Agfa|url=http://www.scanningresources.com/archive.php?lang=en&amp;detail=13|accessdate=26 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed to facilitate calculation of color mixes.

==Technical characteristics==
Mixlink contains the [[Intel 80386]] processor with the [[clock rate]] which may be set to either 9.2 or 33&amp;nbsp;MHz. The [[RAM]] size is 640 kB. The [[Hard disk drive|HDD]] function is served by the built-in flash memory that has the size of approximately 800 kB. Mixlink has the monochrome [[display device|display]].

Mixlink is also staffed with [[CD drive]] and [[floppy drive]].

==Use==

Mixlink was intended to be used with the supplied [[floppy disk|floppy]] and [[Compact Disc|CD disk]], which provided the system environment ("operating system") and the application to be used for calculating color mixes. However, it is possible to install and run [[MS-DOS]] on Mixlink.

Currently, Mixlink computers are not used; their functions may solely be performed by [[Personal computer|personal computers (PCs)]].

The use of computers (including devices such as [[smartphone]]s, [[tablet computer]]s and [[laptop]]s) by children and adolescents before bed has been associated with a reduction in the hours of [[sleep]] experienced by frequent users, along with a decreased quality of sleep, in most cases. The results of computer use at night have been linked with tiredness.

A 2010 review concluded that "the use of electronic media by children and adolescents does have a negative impact on their sleep, although the precise effects and mechanisms remain unclear", with the most consistent results associating excessive media use with shorter sleep duration and delayed bed times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cain |first=Neralie |last2=Gradisar |first2=Michael |title=Electronic media use and sleep in school-aged children and adolescents: a review |journal=Sleep Medicine |date=15 February 2010 |volume=11 |issue=8 |pages=735–742 |url= |doi=10.1016/j.sleep.2010.02.006|pmid=20673649 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 meta-analysis found that "Bedtime access and use of media devices was significantly associated with inadequate sleep quantity; poor sleep quality; and excessive daytime sleepiness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carter|first1=Ben|last2=Rees|first2=Philippa|last3=Hale|first3=Lauren|last4=Bhattacharjee|first4=Darsharna|last5=Paradkar|first5=Mandar S.|title=Association Between Portable Screen-Based Media Device Access or Use and Sleep Outcomes|journal=JAMA Pediatrics|date=1 December 2016|volume=170|issue=12|pages=1202–1208|doi=10.1001/jamapediatrics.2016.2341|pmid=27802500|pmc=5380441|url=https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/60839202/poi160064.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] recommends screen time for children be limited for multiple reasons, among them that "Too much screen time can also harm the amount and quality of sleep".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Academy of Pediatrics Announces New Recommendations for Children's Media Use|url=https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/pages/american-academy-of-pediatrics-announces-new-recommendations-for-childrens-media-use.aspx|website=www.aap.org|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many apps promise to improve sleep by filtering out blue light produced by media devices; there have been no large studies to assess whether such apps work. Some users express dissatisfaction with the resultant orange tint of screens. Some people use blue-blocking glasses, for the purpose of attempting to block out blue light both from electronic media and from other artificial light sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Apps Can Cut Blue Light From Devices, But Do They Help You Sleep?|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/11/27/561740031/apps-can-cut-blue-light-from-devices-but-do-they-help-you-sleep|accessdate=13 March 2018|work=NPR.org|date=2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''computer''' is a device that can be instructed to carry out [[Sequence|sequences]] of [[arithmetic]] or [[Boolean algebra|logical]] operations automatically via [[computer programming]]. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called ''[[Computer program|programs]].'' These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks. A "complete" computer including the [[Computer hardware|hardware]], the [[operating system]] (main [[software]]), and [[peripheral]] equipment required and used for "full" operation can be referred to as a '''computer system'''. This term may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular a [[computer network]] or [[computer cluster]].

Computers are used as [[control system]]s for a wide variety of [[Programmable logic controller|industrial]] and [[Consumer electronics|consumer devices]]. This includes simple special purpose devices like [[microwave oven]]s and [[remote control]]s, factory devices such as [[industrial robot]]s and [[computer-aided design]], and also general purpose devices like [[personal computer]]s and [[mobile device]]s such as [[smartphone]]s. The [[Internet]] is run on computers and it connects hundreds of millions of other computers and their users.

Early computers were only conceived as calculating devices. Since ancient times, simple manual devices like the [[abacus]] aided people in doing calculations. Early in the [[Industrial Revolution]], some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for [[loom]]s. More sophisticated electrical [[machine]]s did specialized [[analogue electronics|analog]] calculations in the early 20th century. The first [[Digital data|digital]] electronic calculating machines were developed during [[World War II]]. The speed, power, and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then.

Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one [[processing element]], typically a [[central processing unit]] (CPU), and some form of [[memory (computers)|memory]]. The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored [[data|information]]. [[Peripheral]] devices include input devices (keyboards, mice, joystick, etc.), output devices (monitor screens, printers, etc.), and input/output devices that perform both functions (e.g., the 2000s-era [[touchscreen]]). [[Peripheral|Peripheral devices]] allow information to be retrieved from an external source and they enable the result of operations to be saved and retrieved.

[[File:X-4 with Female Computer - GPN-2000-001932.jpg|thumb|A female computer, with microscope and calculator, 1952]]
According to the ''Oxford English Dictionary'', the first known use of the word "computer" was in 1613 in a book called ''The Yong Mans Gleanings'' by English writer Richard Braithwait: "I haue [sic] read the truest computer of Times, and the best Arithmetician that euer [sic] breathed, and he reduceth thy dayes into a short number." This usage of the term referred to a [[human computer]], a person who carried out calculations or computations. The word continued with the same meaning until the middle of the 20th century. During the latter part of this period women were often hired as computers because they could be paid less than their male counterparts.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=23}} By 1943, most human computers were women.{{Sfn|Smith|2013|p=6}} From the end of the 19th century the word slowly began to take on its more familiar meaning, a machine that carries out computations.&lt;ref name=OEDComputer&gt;{{Cite journal |title=computer, ''n.'' |series=Oxford English Dictionary |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/ |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=2 |year=1989 |accessdate=10 April 2009 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Online Etymology Dictionary'' gives the first attested use of "computer" in the "1640s, [meaning] "one who calculates,"; this is an "...&amp;nbsp;agent noun from compute (v.)". The ''Online Etymology Dictionary'' states that the use of the term to mean "calculating machine" (of any type) is from 1897."  The ''Online Etymology Dictionary'' indicates that the "modern use" of the term, to mean "programmable digital electronic computer" dates from "...&amp;nbsp;1945 under this name; [in a] theoretical [sense] from 1937, as [[Turing machine]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=computer|title=computer (n.)|website=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|History of computing hardware}}

=== Pre-20th century ===
[[File:Os d'Ishango IRSNB.JPG|thumb|upright=0.45|The [[Ishango bone]]]]
Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, mostly using [[one-to-one correspondence]] with [[finger counting|fingers]]. The earliest counting device was probably a form of [[tally stick]]. Later record keeping aids throughout the [[Fertile Crescent]] included calculi (clay spheres, cones, etc.) which represented counts of items, probably livestock or grains, sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers.&lt;ref&gt;According to {{harvnb|Schmandt-Besserat|1981}}, these clay containers contained tokens, the total of which were the count of objects being transferred. The containers thus served as something of a [[bill of lading]] or an accounts book. In order to avoid breaking open the containers, first, clay impressions of the tokens were placed on the outside of the containers, for the count; the shapes of the impressions were abstracted into stylized marks; finally, the abstract marks were systematically used as numerals; these numerals were finally formalized as numbers. Eventually ([http://www.laits.utexas.edu/ghazal/Chap1/dsb/chapter1.html Schmandt-Besserat estimates it took 4000 years] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130084757/http://www.laits.utexas.edu/ghazal/Chap1/dsb/chapter1.html |date=30 January 2012 }} ) the marks on the outside of the containers were all that were needed to convey the count, and the clay containers evolved into clay tablets with marks for the count.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Eleanor|last=Robson|author-link=Eleanor Robson|year=2008|title=Mathematics in Ancient Iraq|publisher=|isbn=978-0-691-09182-2}}. p.&amp;nbsp;5: calculi were in use in Iraq for primitive accounting systems as early as 3200–3000 BCE, with commodity-specific counting representation systems. Balanced accounting was in use by 3000–2350 BCE, and a [[sexagesimal number system]] was in use 2350–2000 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[counting rods]] is one example.
[[File:Abacus 6.png|thumb|left|The Chinese [[Suanpan]] (算盘) (the number represented on this abacus is 6,302,715,408)]]
The [[abacus]] was initially used for arithmetic tasks. The [[Roman abacus]] was developed from devices used in [[Babylonia]] as early as 2400 BC. Since then, many other forms of reckoning boards or tables have been invented. In a medieval European [[counting house]], a checkered cloth would be placed on a table, and markers moved around on it according to certain rules, as an aid to calculating sums of money.

[[File:NAMA Machine d'Anticythère 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]]-designed [[Antikythera mechanism]], dating between 150 and 100 BC, is the world's oldest analog computer.]]
The [[Antikythera mechanism]] is believed to be the earliest mechanical analog "computer", according to [[Derek J. de Solla Price]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr/project/general/the-project.html ''The Antikythera Mechanism Research Project''], The Antikythera Mechanism Research Project. Retrieved 1 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed to calculate astronomical positions. It was discovered in 1901 in the [[Antikythera wreck]] off the Greek island of [[Antikythera]], between [[Kythera]] and [[Crete]], and has been dated to {{circa|100 BC}}. Devices of a level of complexity comparable to that of the Antikythera mechanism would not reappear until a thousand years later.

Many mechanical aids to calculation and measurement were constructed for astronomical and navigation use. The [[planisphere]] was a [[star chart]] invented by Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī in the early 11th century.&lt;ref name=Wiet&gt;G. Wiet, V. Elisseeff, P. Wolff, J. Naudu (1975). ''History of Mankind, Vol 3: The Great medieval Civilisations'', p. 649. George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd, [[UNESCO]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[astrolabe]] was invented in the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic world]] in either the 1st or 2nd centuries BC and is often attributed to [[Hipparchus]]. A combination of the planisphere and [[dioptra]], the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several different kinds of problems in [[spherical astronomy]]. An astrolabe incorporating a mechanical [[calendar]] computer&lt;ref&gt;Fuat Sezgin "Catalogue of the Exhibition of the Institute for the History of Arabic-Islamic Science (at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University", Frankfurt, Germany) Frankfurt Book Fair 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;35 &amp; 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=François |last=Charette |title=Archaeology: High tech from Ancient Greece |journal=Nature |volume=444 |issue=7119 |pages=551–552 |year=2006 |doi=10.1038/444551a|pmid=17136077 |bibcode=2006Natur.444..551C }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gear]]-wheels was invented by Abi Bakr of [[Isfahan]], [[Persia]] in 1235.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Silvio A.|last1=Bedini|first2=Francis R.|last2=Maddison|year=1966|title=Mechanical Universe: The Astrarium of Giovanni de' Dondi|journal=Transactions of the American Philosophical Society|volume=56|issue=5|pages=1–69|jstor=1006002|doi=10.2307/1006002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī]] invented the first mechanical geared [[lunisolar calendar]] astrolabe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Derek de S.|last=Price|authorlink=Derek J. de Solla Price|year=1984|title=A History of Calculating Machines|journal=IEEE Micro|volume=4|number=1|pages=22–52|doi=10.1109/MM.1984.291305}}&lt;/ref&gt; an early fixed-[[wire]]d knowledge processing [[machine]]&lt;ref name=Oren&gt;{{cite journal|first=Tuncer|last=Őren|authorlink=Tuncer Őren|year=2001|title=Advances in Computer and Information Sciences: From Abacus to Holonic Agents|url=http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~oren/pubs/pubs-2001-02-Tubitak.pdf|journal=Turk J Elec Engin|volume=9|number=1|pages=63–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[gear train]] and gear-wheels,&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Routledge Hill]] (1985).

The [[Sector (instrument)|sector]], a calculating instrument used for solving problems in proportion, trigonometry, multiplication and division, and for various functions, such as squares and cube roots, was developed in the late 16th century and found application in gunnery, surveying and navigation.

The [[planimeter]] was a manual instrument to calculate the area of a closed figure by tracing over it with a mechanical linkage.

[[File:Sliderule 2005.png|thumb|A slide rule]]
The [[slide rule]] was invented around 1620–1630, shortly after the publication of the concept of the [[logarithm]]. It is a hand-operated analog computer for doing multiplication and division. As slide rule development progressed, added scales provided reciprocals, squares and square roots, cubes and cube roots, as well as [[transcendental function]]s such as logarithms and exponentials, circular and [[hyperbolic functions|hyperbolic]] [[trigonometry]] and other [[Function (mathematics)|functions]]. Slide rules with special scales are still used for quick performance of routine calculations, such as the [[E6B]] circular slide rule used for time and distance calculations on light aircraft.

In the 1770s, [[Pierre Jaquet-Droz]], a Swiss [[watchmaker]], built a mechanical doll ([[automata|automaton]]) that could write holding a quill pen. By switching the number and order of its internal wheels different letters, and hence different messages, could be produced. In effect, it could be mechanically "programmed" to read instructions. Along with two other complex machines, the doll is at the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire of [[Neuchâtel]], [[Switzerland]], and still operates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chonday.com/Videos/the-writer-automaton|title=The Writer Automaton, Switzerland|date=11 July 2013|publisher=chonday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tide-predicting machine]] invented by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Sir William Thomson]] in 1872 was of great utility to navigation in shallow waters. It used a system of pulleys and wires to automatically calculate predicted tide levels for a set period at a particular location.

The [[differential analyser]], a mechanical analog computer designed to solve [[differential equations]] by [[integral|integration]], used wheel-and-disc mechanisms to perform the integration. In 1876, [[James Thomson (engineer)|Lord Kelvin]] had already discussed the possible construction of such calculators, but he had been stymied by the limited output torque of the [[ball-and-disk integrator]]s.&lt;ref name="scientific-computing.com"&gt;Ray Girvan, [http://www.scientific-computing.com/scwmayjun03computingmachines.html "The revealed grace of the mechanism: computing after Babbage"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103094710/http://www.scientific-computing.com/scwmayjun03computingmachines.html |date=3 November 2012 }}, ''Scientific Computing World'', May/June 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In a differential analyzer, the output of one integrator drove the input of the next integrator, or a graphing output. The [[torque amplifier]] was the advance that allowed these machines to work. Starting in the 1920s, [[Vannevar Bush]] and others developed mechanical differential analyzers.

=== First computing device ===
[[File:Difference engine plate 1853.jpg|thumb|A portion of [[Charles Babbage|Babbage's]] [[Difference engine]].]]
[[Charles Babbage]], an English mechanical engineer and [[polymath]], originated the concept of a programmable computer. Considered the "[[computer pioneer|father of the computer]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Halacy, Daniel Stephen | title = Charles Babbage, Father of the Computer | year = 1970 | publisher=Crowell-Collier Press | isbn = 978-0-02-741370-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he conceptualized and invented the first [[mechanical computer]] in the early 19th century. After working on his revolutionary [[difference engine]], designed to aid in navigational calculations, in 1833 he realized that a much more general design, an [[Analytical Engine]], was possible. The input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via [[punched card]]s, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical [[loom]]s such as the [[Jacquard loom]]. For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. The Engine incorporated an [[arithmetic logic unit]], [[control flow]] in the form of [[conditional branching]] and [[program loop#Loops|loops]], and integrated [[computer memory|memory]], making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as [[Turing-complete]].&lt;ref name="babbageonline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/onlinestuff/stories/babbage.aspx?page=5|title=Babbage|work=Online stuff|publisher=Science Museum|date=19 January 2007 |accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20827915.500-lets-build-babbages-ultimate-mechanical-computer.html|title=Let's build Babbage's ultimate mechanical computer|work=opinion|publisher=New Scientist|date = 23 December 2010|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The machine was about a century ahead of its time. All the parts for his machine had to be made by hand&amp;nbsp;– this was a major problem for a device with thousands of parts. Eventually, the project was dissolved with the decision of the [[British Government]] to cease funding. Babbage's failure to complete the analytical engine can be chiefly attributed to difficulties not only of politics and financing, but also to his desire to develop an increasingly sophisticated computer and to move ahead faster than anyone else could follow. Nevertheless, his son, Henry Babbage, completed a simplified version of the analytical engine's computing unit (the ''mill'') in 1888. He gave a successful demonstration of its use in computing tables in 1906.

=== Analog computers ===

[[File:099-tpm3-sk.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Sir William Thomson]]'s third tide-predicting machine design, 1879–81]]
During the first half of the 20th century, many scientific [[computing]] needs were met by increasingly sophisticated [[analog computer]]s, which used a direct mechanical or electrical model of the problem as a basis for [[computation]]. However, these were not programmable and generally lacked the versatility and accuracy of modern digital computers.&lt;ref name="stanf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computing-history/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|title=The Modern History of Computing|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern analog computer was a [[tide-predicting machine]], invented by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Sir William Thomson]] in 1872. The [[differential analyser]], a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration using wheel-and-disc mechanisms, was conceptualized in 1876 by [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]], the brother of the more famous Lord Kelvin.&lt;ref name="scientific-computing.com" /&gt;

The art of mechanical analog computing reached its zenith with the [[differential analyzer]], built by H. L. Hazen and [[Vannevar Bush]] at [[MIT]] starting in 1927. This built on the mechanical integrators of [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]] and the torque amplifiers invented by H. W. Nieman. A dozen of these devices were built before their obsolescence became obvious. By the 1950s, the success of digital electronic computers had spelled the end for most analog computing machines, but analog computers remained in use during the 1950s in some specialized applications such as education ([[control systems]]) and aircraft ([[slide rule]]).

=== Digital computers ===
{{split section|Digital computer|date=May 2017}}

==== Electromechanical ====
By 1938, the [[United States Navy]] had developed an electromechanical analog computer small enough to use aboard a [[submarine]]. This was the [[Torpedo Data Computer]], which used trigonometry to solve the problem of firing a torpedo at a moving target. During [[World War II]] similar devices were developed in other countries as well.

[[File:Z3 Deutsches Museum.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Replica of [[Konrad Zuse|Zuse]]'s [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]], the first fully automatic, digital (electromechanical) computer.]]
Early digital computers were electromechanical; electric switches drove mechanical relays to perform the calculation. These devices had a low operating speed and were eventually superseded by much faster all-electric computers, originally using [[vacuum tube]]s. The [[Z2 (computer)|Z2]], created by German engineer [[Konrad Zuse]] in 1939, was one of the earliest examples of an electromechanical relay computer.&lt;ref name="Part 4 Zuse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epemag.com/zuse/part4a.htm|title=Part 4: Konrad Zuse's Z1 and Z3 Computers|last=Zuse|first=Horst|work=The Life and Work of Konrad Zuse|publisher=EPE Online|accessdate=17 June 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080601210541/http://www.epemag.com/zuse/part4a.htm |archivedate = 1 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Zuse followed his earlier machine up with the [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]], the world's first working [[electromechanical]] [[Computer programming|programmable]], fully automatic digital computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Zuse|first=Konrad|author-link=Konrad Zuse|title=The Computer – My Life ''Translated by McKenna, Patricia and Ross, J.

It was quite similar to modern machines in some respects, pioneering numerous advances such as [[floating point number]]s. Rather than the harder-to-implement decimal system (used in [[Charles Babbage]]'s earlier design), using a [[binary numeral system|binary]] system meant that Zuse's machines were easier to build and potentially more reliable, given the technologies available at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://goremotesupport.com/blog/crash-the-story-of-it-zuse|title=Crash!

==== Vacuum tubes and digital electronic circuits ====
{{Anchor|Digital computer|Digital}}
Purely [[electronic circuit]] elements soon replaced their mechanical and electromechanical equivalents, at the same time that digital calculation replaced analog. The engineer [[Tommy Flowers]], working at the [[Post Office Research Station]] in [[London]] in the 1930s, began to explore the possible use of electronics for the [[telephone exchange]]. Experimental equipment that he built in 1934 went into operation five years later, converting a portion of the [[telephone exchange]] network into an electronic data processing system, using thousands of [[vacuum tube]]s.&lt;ref name="stanf" /&gt; In the US, [[John Vincent Atanasoff]] and [[Clifford Berry|Clifford E.

[[File:Colossus.jpg|thumb|[[Colossus computer|Colossus]], the first [[Electronics|electronic]] [[Digital electronics|digital]] [[Computer programming|programmable]] computing device, was used to break German ciphers during World War II.]]
During World War II, the British at [[Bletchley Park]] achieved a number of successes at breaking encrypted German military communications. The German encryption machine, [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]], was first attacked with the help of the electro-mechanical [[bombe]]s which were often run by women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-29840653|title=The woman who cracked Enigma cyphers|last=Miller|first=Joe|date=November 10, 2014|work=BBC News|access-date=October 14, 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2018/jul/24/meet-the-female-codebreakers-of-bletchley-park|title=Meet the female codebreakers of Bletchley Park|last=Bearne|first=Suzanne|date=July 24, 2018|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To crack the more sophisticated German [[Lorenz SZ 40/42]] machine, used for high-level Army communications, [[Max Newman]] and his colleagues commissioned Flowers to build the [[Colossus computer|Colossus]].&lt;ref name=Copeland2006 /&gt; He spent eleven months from early February 1943 designing and building the first Colossus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Bletchley's code-cracking Colossus|publisher=BBC News |date=2 February 2010|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8492762.stm|accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a functional test in December 1943, Colossus was shipped to Bletchley Park, where it was delivered on 18 January 1944&lt;ref name="The Colossus Computer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnmoc.org/colossus-rebuild-story|title=Colossus – The Rebuild Story|website=The National Museum of Computing}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attacked its first message on 5 February.&lt;ref name="Copeland2006" /&gt;

Colossus was the world's first [[electronics|electronic]] [[Digital electronics|digital]] [[Computer programming|programmable]] computer.&lt;ref name="stanf" /&gt; It used a large number of valves (vacuum tubes). It had paper-tape input and was capable of being configured to perform a variety of [[boolean logic]]al operations on its data, but it was not [[Turing-complete]]. Nine Mk II Colossi were built (The Mk I was converted to a Mk II making ten machines in total). Colossus Mark I contained 1,500 thermionic valves (tubes), but Mark II with 2,400 valves, was both 5 times faster and simpler to operate than Mark I, greatly speeding the decoding process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Randell|first1=Brian|author-link1=Brian Randell|last2=Fensom|first2=Harry|last3=Milne|first3=Frank A.|title=Obituary: Allen Coombs|newspaper=The Independent|date=15 March 1995|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-allen-coombs-1611270.html|accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Fensom|first=Jim|title=Harry Fensom obituary|date=8 November 2010|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/nov/08/harry-fensom-obituary|accessdate=17 October 2012|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eniac.jpg|thumb|left|[[ENIAC]] was the first electronic, Turing-complete device, and performed ballistics trajectory calculations for the [[United States Army]].]]
The U.S.-built [[ENIAC]]&lt;ref&gt;John Presper Eckert Jr. and John W. Mauchly, Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, United States Patent Office, US Patent 3,120,606, filed 26 June 1947, issued 4 February 1964, and invalidated 19 October 1973 after court ruling on ''[[Honeywell v. Sperry Rand]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was the first electronic programmable computer built in the US. Although the ENIAC was similar to the Colossus, it was much faster, more flexible, and it was [[Turing-complete]]. Like the Colossus, a "program" on the ENIAC was defined by the states of its patch cables and switches, a far cry from the [[stored program]] electronic machines that came later. Once a program was written, it had to be mechanically set into the machine with manual resetting of plugs and switches. The programmers of the ENIAC were six women, often known collectively as the "ENIAC girls".{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=39}}{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=459}}

It combined the high speed of electronics with the ability to be programmed for many complex problems. It could add or subtract 5000 times a second, a thousand times faster than any other machine. It also had modules to multiply, divide, and square root. High speed memory was limited to 20 words (about 80 bytes). Built under the direction of [[John Mauchly]] and [[J. Presper Eckert]] at the University of Pennsylvania, ENIAC's development and construction lasted from 1943 to full operation at the end of 1945. The machine was huge, weighing 30 tons, using 200 kilowatts of electric power and contained over 18,000 vacuum tubes, 1,500 relays, and hundreds of thousands of resistors, capacitors, and inductors.&lt;ref name="Eniac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techiwarehouse.com/engine/a046ee08/Generations-of-Computer|title=Generations of Computer|publisher=techiwarehouse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern computers ===

==== Concept of modern computer ====
The principle of the modern computer was proposed by [[Alan Turing]] in his seminal 1936 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://plms.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/s2-42/1/230|doi=10.1112/plms/s2-42.1.230|title=On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem|first=A. M.|last=Turing|journal=Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society|year=1937|series=2|volume=42|number=1|pages=230–265}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''On Computable Numbers''. Turing proposed a simple device that he called "Universal Computing machine" and that is now known as a [[universal Turing machine]]. He proved that such a machine is capable of computing anything that is computable by executing instructions (program) stored on tape, allowing the machine to be programmable. The fundamental concept of Turing's design is the [[stored program]], where all the instructions for computing are stored in memory. [[John von Neumann|Von Neumann]] acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper.&lt;ref&gt;"von Neumann&amp;nbsp;... firmly emphasized to me, and to others I am sure, that the fundamental conception is owing to Turing—insofar as not anticipated by Babbage, Lovelace and others." Letter by [[Stanley Frankel]] to [[Brian Randell]], 1972, quoted in [[Jack Copeland]] (2004) ''The Essential Turing'', p22.&lt;/ref&gt; Turing machines are to this day a central object of study in [[theory of computation]]. Except for the limitations imposed by their finite memory stores, modern computers are said to be [[Turing-complete]], which is to say, they have [[algorithm]] execution capability equivalent to a universal Turing machine.

==== Stored programs ====
[[File:SSEM Manchester museum close up.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|alt=Three tall racks containing electronic circuit boards|A section of the [[Manchester Baby]], the first electronic stored-program computer]]
Early computing machines had fixed programs. Changing its function required the re-wiring and re-structuring of the machine.&lt;ref name="Copeland2006" /&gt; With the proposal of the stored-program computer this changed. A stored-program computer includes by design an [[instruction set]] and can store in memory a set of instructions (a [[computer program|program]]) that details the [[computation]]. The theoretical basis for the stored-program computer was laid by [[Alan Turing]] in his 1936 paper. In 1945, Turing joined the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] and began work on developing an electronic stored-program digital computer. His 1945 report "Proposed Electronic Calculator" was the first specification for such a device. John von Neumann at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] also circulated his ''[[First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC]]'' in 1945.&lt;ref name="stanf" /&gt;

The [[Manchester Baby]] was the world's first [[stored-program computer]]. It was built at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] by [[Frederic Calland Williams|Frederic C. Williams]], [[Tom Kilburn]] and [[Geoff Tootill]], and ran its first program on 21 June 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Enticknap |first=Nicholas |title=Computing's Golden Jubilee |journal=Resurrection |issue=20 |date=Summer 1998 |url=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res20.htm#d |issn=0958-7403 |accessdate=19 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed as a [[testbed]] for the [[Williams tube]], the first [[Random-access memory|random-access]] digital storage device.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Early computers at Manchester University|journal=Resurrection|volume=1|issue=4|date=Summer 1992|url=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res04.htm#g|issn=0958-7403|accessdate=7 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828010743/http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res04.htm#g|archive-date=28 August 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the computer was considered "small and primitive" by the standards of its time, it was the first working machine to contain all of the elements essential to a modern electronic computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.computer50.org/mark1/contemporary.html|title=Early Electronic Computers (1946–51)|publisher=University of Manchester|accessdate=16 November 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105031620/http://www.computer50.org/mark1/contemporary.html|archivedate=5 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As soon as the Baby had demonstrated the feasibility of its design, a project was initiated at the university to develop it into a more usable computer, the [[Manchester Mark 1]]. [[Grace Hopper]] was the first person to develop a [[compiler]] for programming language.{{Sfn|Smith|2013|p=6}}

The Mark 1 in turn quickly became the prototype for the [[Ferranti Mark 1]], the world's first commercially available general-purpose computer.&lt;ref name=NapperMK1&gt;{{citation |last=Napper |first=R.

Lyons and Co.|J. Lyons &amp; Company]] decided to take an active role in promoting the commercial development of computers. The [[LEO computer|LEO I]] computer became operational in April 1951&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Lavington | first = Simon | title = A brief history of British computers: the first 25 years (1948–1973). | publisher = [[British Computer Society]] | url = http://www.bcs.org/server.php? | accessdate = 10 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ran the world's first regular routine office computer [[job (software)|job]].

==== Transistors ====
&lt;!-- [[Second generation of computers]] redirects here --&gt;
[[File:Transistor-die-KSY34.jpg|thumb|right|A [[bipolar junction transistor]]]]
The bipolar [[transistor]] was invented in 1947. From 1955 onwards transistors replaced [[vacuum tube]]s in computer designs, giving rise to the "second generation" of computers.
Compared to vacuum tubes, transistors have many advantages: they are smaller, and require less power than vacuum tubes, so give off less heat. Silicon junction transistors were much more reliable than vacuum tubes and had longer, indefinite, service life. Transistorized computers could contain tens of thousands of binary logic circuits in a relatively compact space.

At the [[University of Manchester]], a team under the leadership of [[Tom Kilburn]] designed and built a machine using the newly developed [[transistor]]s instead of valves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Lavington|first=Simon|title=A History of Manchester Computers|year=1998|edition=2|publisher=The British Computer Society|location=Swindon|pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first [[transistor computer|transistorised computer]] and the first in the world, was [[Manchester computers#Transistor Computer|operational by 1953]], and a second version was completed there in April 1955. However, the machine did make use of valves to generate its 125&amp;nbsp;kHz clock waveforms and in the circuitry to read and write on its magnetic [[drum memory]], so it was not the first completely transistorized computer. That distinction goes to the [[Harwell CADET]] of 1955,&lt;ref name="ieeexplore.ieee"&gt;{{citation |doi=10.1049/esej:19980301 |last=Cooke-Yarborough |first=E.

==== Integrated circuits ====
The next great advance in computing power came with the advent of the [[integrated circuit]].
The idea of the integrated circuit was first conceived by a radar scientist working for the [[Royal Radar Establishment]] of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], [[Geoffrey Dummer|Geoffrey W.A. Dummer]]. Dummer presented the first public description of an integrated circuit at the Symposium on Progress in Quality Electronic Components in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington,&amp;nbsp;D.C.]] on 7 May 1952.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epn-online.com/page/22909/the-hapless-tale-of-geoffrey-dummer-this-is-the-sad-.html "The Hapless Tale of Geoffrey Dummer"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511181443/http://www.epn-online.com/page/22909/the-hapless-tale-of-geoffrey-dummer-this-is-the-sad-.html |date=11 May 2013 }}, (n.d.), (HTML), ''Electronic Product News'', accessed 8 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first practical ICs were invented by [[Jack Kilby]] at [[Texas Instruments]] and [[Robert Noyce]] at [[Fairchild Semiconductor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Jack|last=Kilby|author-link=Jack Kilby|title=Nobel lecture|publisher=Nobel Foundation|year=2000|location=Stockholm|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2000/kilby-lecture.pdf|accessdate=15 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit in July 1958, successfully demonstrating the first working integrated example on 12 September 1958.&lt;ref name="TIJackBuilt"&gt;[http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/kilbyctr/jackbuilt.shtml ''The Chip that Jack Built''], (c. 2008), (HTML), Texas Instruments, Retrieved 29 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In his patent application of 6 February 1959, Kilby described his new device as "a body of semiconductor material&amp;nbsp;... wherein all the components of the electronic circuit are completely integrated".&lt;ref&gt;Jack S. Kilby, Miniaturized Electronic Circuits, United States Patent Office, US Patent 3,138,743, filed 6 February 1959, issued 23 June 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Winston| first = Brian| title = Media Technology and Society: A History : From the Telegraph to the Internet| url = https://books.google.com/?id=gfeCXlElJTwC&amp;pg=PA221| year = 1998| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-0-415-14230-4| page = 221 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Noyce also came up with his own idea of an integrated circuit half a year later than Kilby.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Noyce]]'s Unitary circuit, {{Ref patent |country=US |number=2981877|status=patent|gdate=1961-04-25|title=Semiconductor device-and-lead structure |assign1 =[[Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His chip solved many practical problems that Kilby's had not. Produced at Fairchild Semiconductor, it was made of [[silicon]], whereas Kilby's chip was made of [[germanium]].

This new development heralded an explosion in the commercial and personal use of computers and led to the invention of the [[microprocessor]]. While the subject of exactly which device was the first microprocessor is contentious, partly due to lack of agreement on the exact definition of the term "microprocessor", it is largely undisputed that the first single-chip microprocessor was the [[Intel 4004]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Intel's First Microprocessor—the Intel 4004 |publisher=Intel Corp. |date=November 1971 |url=http://www.intel.com/museum/archives/4004.htm |accessdate=17 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513221700/http://www.intel.com/museum/archives/4004.htm |archivedate=13 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; designed and realized by [[Marcian Hoff|Ted Hoff]], [[Federico Faggin]], and Stanley Mazor at [[Intel]].&lt;ref&gt;The Intel 4004 (1971) die was 12&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, composed of 2300 transistors; by comparison, the Pentium Pro was 306&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, composed of 5.5&amp;nbsp;million transistors, according to {{citation|last1= Patterson |first1= David |last2= Hennessy|first2= John|year=1998|title= Computer Organization and Design |location= San Francisco|publisher=[[Morgan Kaufmann]]|isbn = 978-1-55860-428-5|pages=27–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mobile computers ===

The first [[portable computer|mobile computers]] were heavy and ran from mains power. The 50lb [[IBM 5100]] was an early example. Later portables such as the [[Osborne 1]] and [[Compaq Portable]] were considerably lighter, but still needed to be plugged in. The first [[laptop]]s, such as the [[Grid Compass]], removed this requirement by incorporating batteries – and with the continued miniaturization of computing resources and advancements in portable battery life, portable computers grew in popularity in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2008/12/global-notebook-shipments-finally-overtake-desktops/|title=Global notebook shipments finally overtake desktops|work=Ars Technica|first=David|last=Chartier|date=23 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same developments allowed manufacturers to integrate computing resources into cellular phones.

These [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer|tablets]] run on a variety of operating systems and soon became the dominant computing device on the market, with manufacturers reporting having shipped an estimated 237 million devices in 2Q 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=IDC|title=Growth Accelerates in the Worldwide Mobile Phone and Smartphone Markets in the Second Quarter, According to IDC|date=25 July 2013|url=http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS24239313|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626022208/http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS24239313|archive-date=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A general purpose computer has four main components: the [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU), the [[control unit]], the [[Computer data storage|memory]], and the [[input and output devices]] (collectively termed I/O). These parts are interconnected by [[bus (computing)|buses]], often made of groups of [[wire]]s.
Inside each of these parts are thousands to trillions of small [[electrical network|electrical circuits]] which can be turned off or on by means of an [[transistor|electronic switch]]. Each circuit represents a [[bit]] (binary digit) of information so that when the circuit is on it represents a "1", and when off it represents a "0" (in positive logic representation). The circuits are arranged in [[logic gate]]s so that one or more of the circuits may control the state of one or more of the other circuits.

=== Input devices ===
When unprocessed data is sent to the computer with the help of input devices, the data is processed and sent to output devices. The input devices may be hand-operated or automated. The act of processing is mainly regulated by the CPU. Some examples of input devices are:
* [[Computer keyboard]]
* [[Digital camera]]
* [[Digital video]]
* [[Graphics tablet]]
* [[Image scanner]]
* [[Joystick]]
* [[Microphone]]
* [[Mouse (computing)|Mouse]]
* [[Overlay keyboard]]
* [[Real-time clock]]
* [[Trackball]]
* [[Touchscreen]]

=== Output devices ===
The means through which computer gives output are known as output devices. Some examples of output devices are:
* [[Computer monitor]]
* [[Printer (computing)|Printer]]
* [[PC speaker]]
* [[Projector]]
* [[Sound card]]
* [[Video card]]

=== Control unit ===
{{Main|CPU design|Control unit}}
[[File:Mips32 addi.svg|thumb|right|Diagram showing how a particular [[MIPS architecture]] instruction would be decoded by the control system]]

The control unit (often called a control system or central controller) manages the computer's various components; it reads and interprets (decodes) the program instructions, transforming them into control signals that activate other parts of the computer.&lt;ref&gt;The control unit's role in interpreting instructions has varied somewhat in the past. Although the control unit is solely responsible for instruction interpretation in most modern computers, this is not always the case. Some computers have instructions that are partially interpreted by the control unit with further interpretation performed by another device. For example, [[EDVAC]], one of the earliest stored-program computers, used a central control unit that only interpreted four instructions. All of the arithmetic-related instructions were passed on to its arithmetic unit and further decoded there.&lt;/ref&gt; Control systems in advanced computers may change the order of execution of some instructions to improve performance.

A key component common to all CPUs is the [[program counter]], a special memory cell (a [[processor register|register]]) that keeps track of which location in memory the next instruction is to be read from.&lt;ref&gt;Instructions often occupy more than one memory address, therefore the program counter usually increases by the number of memory locations required to store one instruction.&lt;/ref&gt;

The control system's function is as follows—note that this is a simplified description, and some of these steps may be performed concurrently or in a different order depending on the type of CPU:

# Read the code for the next instruction from the cell indicated by the program counter.
# Decode the numerical code for the instruction into a set of commands or signals for each of the other systems.
# Increment the program counter so it points to the next instruction.
# Read whatever data the instruction requires from cells in memory (or perhaps from an input device). The location of this required data is typically stored within the instruction code.
# Provide the necessary data to an ALU or register.
# If the instruction requires an ALU or specialized hardware to complete, instruct the hardware to perform the requested operation.
# Write the result from the ALU back to a memory location or to a register or perhaps an output device.
# Jump back to step (1).

Since the program counter is (conceptually) just another set of memory cells, it can be changed by calculations done in the ALU. Adding 100 to the program counter would cause the next instruction to be read from a place 100 locations further down the program. Instructions that modify the program counter are often known as "jumps" and allow for loops (instructions that are repeated by the computer) and often conditional instruction execution (both examples of [[control flow]]).

The sequence of operations that the control unit goes through to process an instruction is in itself like a short computer program, and indeed, in some more complex CPU designs, there is another yet smaller computer called a [[microsequencer]], which runs a [[microcode]] program that causes all of these events to happen.

=== Central processing unit (CPU) ===
The control unit, ALU, and registers are collectively known as a [[central processing unit]] (CPU). Early CPUs were composed of many separate components but since the mid-1970s CPUs have typically been constructed on a single [[integrated circuit]] called a ''[[microprocessor]]''.

=== Arithmetic logic unit (ALU) ===
{{Main|Arithmetic logic unit}}

The ALU is capable of performing two classes of operations: arithmetic and logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The set of arithmetic operations that a particular ALU supports may be limited to addition and subtraction, or might include multiplication, division, [[trigonometry]] functions such as sine, cosine, etc., and [[square root]]s. Some can only operate on whole numbers ([[integer]]s) while others use [[floating point]] to represent [[real number]]s, albeit with limited precision. However, any computer that is capable of performing just the simplest operations can be programmed to break down the more complex operations into simple steps that it can perform. Therefore, any computer can be programmed to perform any arithmetic operation—although it will take more time to do so if its ALU does not directly support the operation. An ALU may also compare numbers and return [[Truth value|boolean truth values]] (true or false) depending on whether one is equal to, greater than or less than the other ("is 64 greater than 65?"). Logic operations involve [[Boolean logic]]: [[logical conjunction|AND]], [[logical disjunction|OR]], [[Exclusive or|XOR]], and [[Negation|NOT]]. These can be useful for creating complicated [[conditional (programming)|conditional statements]] and processing [[boolean logic]].

[[Superscalar]] computers may contain multiple ALUs, allowing them to process several instructions simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Handbook of Parallel Computing and Statistics | author = Erricos John Kontoghiorghes | publisher = CRC Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-8247-4067-2 | page = 45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Graphics processing unit|Graphics processors]] and computers with [[SIMD]] and [[MIMD]] features often contain ALUs that can perform arithmetic on [[Euclidean vector|vectors]] and [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]].

=== Memory ===
{{Main|Computer data storage}}
[[File:Magnetic core.jpg|thumb|right|[[Magnetic core memory]] was the computer memory of choice throughout the 1960s, until it was replaced by semiconductor memory.]]

A computer's memory can be viewed as a list of cells into which numbers can be placed or read. Each cell has a numbered "address" and can store a single number. The computer can be instructed to "put the number 123 into the cell numbered 1357" or to "add the number that is in cell 1357 to the number that is in cell 2468 and put the answer into cell 1595." The information stored in memory may represent practically anything. Letters, numbers, even computer instructions can be placed into memory with equal ease. Since the CPU does not differentiate between different types of information, it is the software's responsibility to give significance to what the memory sees as nothing but a series of numbers.

In almost all modern computers, each memory cell is set up to store [[binary numeral system|binary numbers]] in groups of eight bits (called a [[byte]]). Each byte is able to represent 256 different numbers (2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; = 256); either from 0 to 255 or −128 to +127. To store larger numbers, several consecutive bytes may be used (typically, two, four or eight). When negative numbers are required, they are usually stored in [[two's complement]] notation. Other arrangements are possible, but are usually not seen outside of specialized applications or historical contexts. A computer can store any kind of information in memory if it can be represented numerically. Modern computers have billions or even trillions of bytes of memory.

The CPU contains a special set of memory cells called [[Processor register|registers]] that can be read and written to much more rapidly than the main memory area. There are typically between two and one hundred registers depending on the type of CPU. Registers are used for the most frequently needed data items to avoid having to access main memory every time data is needed. As data is constantly being worked on, reducing the need to access main memory (which is often slow compared to the ALU and control units) greatly increases the computer's speed.

Computer main memory comes in two principal varieties:
* [[random-access memory]] or RAM
* [[read-only memory]] or ROM
RAM can be read and written to anytime the CPU commands it, but ROM is preloaded with data and software that never changes, therefore the CPU can only read from it. ROM is typically used to store the computer's initial start-up instructions. In general, the contents of RAM are erased when the power to the computer is turned off, but ROM retains its data indefinitely. In a PC, the ROM contains a specialized program called the [[BIOS]] that orchestrates loading the computer's [[operating system]] from the hard disk drive into RAM whenever the computer is turned on or reset. In [[embedded system|embedded computers]], which frequently do not have disk drives, all of the required software may be stored in ROM. Software stored in ROM is often called [[firmware]], because it is notionally more like hardware than software. [[Flash memory]] blurs the distinction between ROM and RAM, as it retains its data when turned off but is also rewritable. It is typically much slower than conventional ROM and RAM however, so its use is restricted to applications where high speed is unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Flash memory also may only be rewritten a limited number of times before wearing out, making it less useful for heavy random access usage. {{harv|Verma &amp; Mielke|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more sophisticated computers there may be one or more RAM [[CPU cache|cache memories]], which are slower than registers but faster than main memory. Generally computers with this sort of cache are designed to move frequently needed data into the cache automatically, often without the need for any intervention on the programmer's part.

=== Input/output (I/O) ===
{{Main|Input/output}}
[[File:HDDspin.JPG|thumb|right|[[Hard disk drive]]s are common storage devices used with computers.]]
I/O is the means by which a computer exchanges information with the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Introduction to the Basic Computer | author = Donald Eadie | year = 1968 | publisher = Prentice-Hall | page = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Devices that provide input or output to the computer are called [[peripheral]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Introduction to Microcomputers and the Microprocessors | author = Arpad Barna |author2=Dan I. Porat | publisher = Wiley | year = 1976 | isbn = 978-0-471-05051-3 | page = 85 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On a typical personal computer, peripherals include input devices like the keyboard and [[mouse (computing)|mouse]], and output devices such as the [[computer monitor|display]] and [[printer (computing)|printer]]. [[Hard disk drive]]s, [[floppy disk]] drives and [[optical disc drive]]s serve as both input and output devices. [[Computer networking]] is another form of I/O.
I/O devices are often complex computers in their own right, with their own CPU and memory. A [[graphics processing unit]] might contain fifty or more tiny computers that perform the calculations necessary to display [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Modern [[desktop computer]]s contain many smaller computers that assist the main CPU in performing I/O. A 2016-era flat screen display contains its own computer circuitry.

=== Multitasking ===
{{Main|Computer multitasking}}
While a computer may be viewed as running one gigantic program stored in its main memory, in some systems it is necessary to give the appearance of running several programs simultaneously. This is achieved by multitasking i.e. having the computer switch rapidly between running each program in turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Learning the UNIX Operating System: A Concise Guide for the New User | author = Jerry Peek |author2=Grace Todino |author3=John Strang  | publisher = O'Reilly | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-596-00261-9 | page = 130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One means by which this is done is with a special signal called an [[interrupt]], which can periodically cause the computer to stop executing instructions where it was and do something else instead. By remembering where it was executing prior to the interrupt, the computer can return to that task later. If several programs are running "at the same time". then the interrupt generator might be causing several hundred interrupts per second, causing a program switch each time. Since modern computers typically execute instructions several orders of magnitude faster than human perception, it may appear that many programs are running at the same time even though only one is ever executing in any given instant. This method of multitasking is sometimes termed "time-sharing" since each program is allocated a "slice" of time in turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Noise Reduction in Speech Applications | author = Gillian M. Davis | publisher = CRC Press | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-8493-0949-6 | page = 111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the era of inexpensive computers, the principal use for multitasking was to allow many people to share the same computer. Seemingly, multitasking would cause a computer that is switching between several programs to run more slowly, in direct proportion to the number of programs it is running, but most programs spend much of their time waiting for slow input/output devices to complete their tasks. If a program is waiting for the user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard, then it will not take a "time slice" until the event it is waiting for has occurred. This frees up time for other programs to execute so that many programs may be run simultaneously without unacceptable speed loss.

=== Multiprocessing ===
{{Main|Multiprocessing}}
[[File:Cray 2 Arts et Metiers dsc03940.jpg|thumb|[[Cray]] designed many supercomputers that used multiprocessing heavily.]]
Some computers are designed to distribute their work across several CPUs in a multiprocessing configuration, a technique once employed only in large and powerful machines such as [[supercomputer]]s, [[mainframe computer]]s and [[server (computing)|servers]]. Multiprocessor and [[multi-core]] (multiple CPUs on a single integrated circuit) personal and laptop computers are now widely available, and are being increasingly used in lower-end markets as a result.

Supercomputers in particular often have highly unique architectures that differ significantly from the basic stored-program architecture and from general purpose computers.&lt;ref&gt;However, it is also very common to construct supercomputers out of many pieces of cheap commodity hardware; usually individual computers connected by networks. These so-called [[computer cluster]]s can often provide supercomputer performance at a much lower cost than customized designs. While custom architectures are still used for most of the most powerful supercomputers, there has been a proliferation of cluster computers in recent years. {{harv|TOP500|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; They often feature thousands of CPUs, customized high-speed interconnects, and specialized computing hardware. Such designs tend to be useful only for specialized tasks due to the large scale of program organization required to successfully utilize most of the available resources at once. Supercomputers usually see usage in large-scale [[Computer simulation|simulation]], [[Rendering (computer graphics)|graphics rendering]], and [[cryptography]] applications, as well as with other so-called "[[embarrassingly parallel]]" tasks.

== Software ==
{{Main|Computer software}}
''Software'' refers to parts of the computer which do not have a material form, such as programs, data, protocols, etc. Software is that part of a computer system that consists of encoded information or computer instructions, in contrast to the physical [[Computer hardware|hardware]] from which the system is built. Computer software includes [[computer program]]s, [[Library (computing)|libraries]] and related non-executable [[Data (computing)|data]], such as [[Software documentation|online documentation]] or [[digital media]]. It is often divided into [[system software]] and application software]] Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own. When software is stored in hardware that cannot easily be modified, such as with [[BIOS]] [[Read-only memory|ROM]] in an [[IBM PC compatible]] computer, it is sometimes called "firmware".

=== Programs ===
The defining feature of modern computers which distinguishes them from all other machines is that they can be [[computer programming|programmed]]. That is to say that some type of [[Instruction (computer science)|instructions]] (the [[Computer program|program]]) can be given to the computer, and it will process them. Modern computers based on the [[von Neumann architecture]] often have machine code in the form of an [[imperative programming language]]. In practical terms, a computer program may be just a few instructions or extend to many millions of instructions, as do the programs for [[word processor]]s and [[web browser]]s for example. A typical modern computer can execute billions of instructions per second ([[FLOPS|gigaflops]]) and rarely makes a mistake over many years of operation. Large computer programs consisting of several million instructions may take teams of [[programmer]]s years to write, and due to the complexity of the task almost certainly contain errors.

==== Stored program architecture ====
{{Main|Computer program|Computer programming}}
[[File:SSEM Manchester museum.jpg|thumb|right|Replica of the [[Manchester Baby]], the world's first electronic [[stored-program computer]], at the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Manchester)|Museum of Science and Industry]] in Manchester, England]]
This section applies to most common [[RAM machine]]–based computers.

In most cases, computer instructions are simple: add one number to another, move some data from one location to another, send a message to some external device, etc. These instructions are read from the computer's [[Computer data storage|memory]] and are generally carried out ([[execution (computing)|executed]]) in the order they were given. However, there are usually specialized instructions to tell the computer to jump ahead or backwards to some other place in the program and to carry on executing from there. These are called "jump" instructions (or [[Branch (computer science)|branches]]). Furthermore, jump instructions may be made to happen [[conditional (programming)|conditionally]] so that different sequences of instructions may be used depending on the result of some previous calculation or some external event. Many computers directly support [[subroutine]]s by providing a type of jump that "remembers" the location it jumped from and another instruction to return to the instruction following that jump instruction.

Program execution might be likened to reading a book. While a person will normally read each word and line in sequence, they may at times jump back to an earlier place in the text or skip sections that are not of interest. Similarly, a computer may sometimes go back and repeat the instructions in some section of the program over and over again until some internal condition is met. This is called the [[control flow|flow of control]] within the program and it is what allows the computer to perform tasks repeatedly without human intervention.

Comparatively, a person using a pocket [[calculator]] can perform a basic arithmetic operation such as adding two numbers with just a few button presses. But to add together all of the numbers from 1 to 1,000 would take thousands of button presses and a lot of time, with a near certainty of making a mistake. On the other hand, a computer may be programmed to do this with just a few simple instructions. The following example is written in the [[MIPS architecture|MIPS assembly language]]:
{{Clear}}
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="asm"&gt;
  begin:
  addi $8, $0, 0           # initialize sum to 0
  addi $9, $0, 1           # set first number to add = 1
  loop:
  slti $10, $9, 1000       # check if the number is less than 1000
  beq $10, $0, finish      # if odd number is greater than n then exit
  add $8, $8, $9           # update sum
  addi $9, $9, 1           # get next number
  j loop                   # repeat the summing process
  finish:
  add $2, $8, $0           # put sum in output register
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Once told to run this program, the computer will perform the repetitive addition task without further human intervention. It will almost never make a mistake and a modern PC can complete the task in a fraction of a second.

==== Machine code ====
In most computers, individual instructions are stored as [[machine code]] with each instruction being given a unique number (its operation code or [[opcode]] for short). The command to add two numbers together would have one opcode; the command to multiply them would have a different opcode, and so on. The simplest computers are able to perform any of a handful of different instructions; the more complex computers have several hundred to choose from, each with a unique numerical code. Since the computer's memory is able to store numbers, it can also store the instruction codes. This leads to the important fact that entire programs (which are just lists of these instructions) can be represented as lists of numbers and can themselves be manipulated inside the computer in the same way as numeric data. The fundamental concept of storing programs in the computer's memory alongside the data they operate on is the crux of the von Neumann, or stored program{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}, architecture. In some cases, a computer might store some or all of its program in memory that is kept separate from the data it operates on. This is called the [[Harvard architecture]] after the [[Harvard Mark I]] computer. Modern von Neumann computers display some traits of the Harvard architecture in their designs, such as in [[CPU cache]]s.

While it is possible to write computer programs as long lists of numbers ([[machine code|machine language]]) and while this technique was used with many early computers,&lt;ref&gt;Even some later computers were commonly programmed directly in machine code. Some [[minicomputer]]s like the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-8]] could be programmed directly from a panel of switches. However, this method was usually used only as part of the [[booting]] process. Most modern computers boot entirely automatically by reading a boot program from some [[non-volatile memory]].&lt;/ref&gt; it is extremely tedious and potentially error-prone to do so in practice, especially for complicated programs. Instead, each basic instruction can be given a short name that is indicative of its function and easy to remember&amp;nbsp;– a [[mnemonic]] such as ADD, SUB, MULT or JUMP. These mnemonics are collectively known as a computer's [[assembly language]]. Converting programs written in assembly language into something the computer can actually understand (machine language) is usually done by a computer program called an assembler.

[[File:FortranCardPROJ039.agr.jpg|thumb|right|A 1970s [[punched card]] containing one line from a [[Fortran]] program. The card reads: "Z(1) = Y + W(1)" and is labeled "PROJ039" for identification purposes.]]

==== Programming language ====
{{Main|Programming language}}
Programming languages provide various ways of specifying programs for computers to run. Unlike [[natural language]]s, programming languages are designed to permit no ambiguity and to be concise. They are purely written languages and are often difficult to read aloud. They are generally either translated into [[machine code]] by a [[compiler]] or an [[assembler (computer programming)|assembler]] before being run, or translated directly at run time by an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]]. Sometimes programs are executed by a hybrid method of the two techniques.

===== Low-level languages =====
{{Main|Low-level programming language}}
Machine languages and the assembly languages that represent them (collectively termed ''low-level programming languages'') tend to be unique to a particular type of computer. For instance, an [[ARM architecture]] computer (such as may be found in a [[smartphone]] or a [[handheld video game|hand-held videogame]]) cannot understand the machine language of an [[x86]] CPU that might be in a [[Personal computer|PC]].&lt;ref&gt;However, there is sometimes some form of machine language compatibility between different computers. An [[x86-64]] compatible microprocessor like the [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] [[Athlon 64]] is able to run most of the same programs that an [[Intel Core 2]] microprocessor can, as well as programs designed for earlier microprocessors like the Intel [[Pentium]]s and [[Intel 80486]]. This contrasts with very early commercial computers, which were often one-of-a-kind and totally incompatible with other computers.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== High-level languages =====
{{Main|High-level programming language}}
Although considerably easier than in machine language, writing long programs in assembly language is often difficult and is also error prone. Therefore, most practical programs are written in more abstract [[high-level programming language]]s that are able to express the needs of the [[programmer]] more conveniently (and thereby help reduce programmer error). High level languages are usually "compiled" into machine language (or sometimes into assembly language and then into machine language) using another computer program called a [[compiler]].&lt;ref&gt;High level languages are also often [[interpreted language|interpreted]] rather than compiled. Interpreted languages are translated into machine code on the fly, while running, by another program called an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]].&lt;/ref&gt; High level languages are less related to the workings of the target computer than assembly language, and more related to the language and structure of the problem(s) to be solved by the final program. It is therefore often possible to use different compilers to translate the same high level language program into the machine language of many different types of computer. This is part of the means by which software like video games may be made available for different computer architectures such as personal computers and various [[video game console]]s.

==== Program design ====
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
Program design of small programs is relatively simple and involves the analysis of the problem, collection of inputs, using the programming constructs within languages, devising or using established procedures and algorithms, providing data for output devices and solutions to the problem as applicable. As problems become larger and more complex, features such as subprograms, modules, formal documentation, and new paradigms such as object-oriented programming are encountered. Large programs involving thousands of line of code and more require formal software methodologies.
The task of developing large [[Computer software|software]] systems presents a significant intellectual challenge. Producing software with an acceptably high reliability within a predictable schedule and budget has historically been difficult; the academic and professional discipline of [[software engineering]] concentrates specifically on this challenge.

==== Bugs ====
{{Main|Software bug}}
[[File:H96566k.jpg|thumb|The actual first computer bug, a moth found trapped on a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer]]
Errors in computer programs are called "[[Software bug|bugs]]". They may be benign and not affect the usefulness of the program, or have only subtle effects. But in some cases, they may cause the program or the entire system to "[[Hang (computing)|hang]]", becoming unresponsive to input such as [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] clicks or keystrokes, to completely fail, or to [[Crash (computing)|crash]]. Otherwise benign bugs may sometimes be harnessed for malicious intent by an unscrupulous user writing an [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]], code designed to take advantage of a bug and disrupt a computer's proper execution. Bugs are usually not the fault of the computer. Since computers merely execute the instructions they are given, bugs are nearly always the result of programmer error or an oversight made in the program's design.&lt;ref&gt;It is not universally true that bugs are solely due to programmer oversight. Computer hardware may fail or may itself have a fundamental problem that produces unexpected results in certain situations. For instance, the [[Pentium FDIV bug]] caused some [[Intel Corporation|Intel]] [[microprocessor]]s in the early 1990s to produce inaccurate results for certain [[floating point]] division operations. This was caused by a flaw in the microprocessor design and resulted in a partial recall of the affected devices.&lt;/ref&gt;
Admiral [[Grace Hopper]], an American computer scientist and developer of the first [[compiler]], is credited for having first used the term "bugs" in computing after a dead moth was found shorting a relay in the [[Harvard Mark II]] computer in September 1947.&lt;ref name="taylor84"&gt;{{cite news

{{Main|Computer networking|Internet}}
[[File:Internet map 1024.jpg|thumb|left|Visualization of a portion of the [[Routing|routes]] on the Internet]]
Computers have been used to coordinate information between multiple locations since the 1950s. The U.S. military's [[Semi Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] system was the first large-scale example of such a system, which led to a number of special-purpose commercial systems such as [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Systems, Experts, and Computers | author = Agatha C.

The effort was funded by ARPA (now [[DARPA]]), and the [[computer network]] that resulted was called the [[ARPANET]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Brief History of the Internet|url=http://www.isoc.org/internet/history/brief.shtml|publisher=[[Internet Society]]|accessdate=20 September 2008|bibcode=1999cs........1011L|last1=Leiner|first1=Barry M.|last2=Cerf|first2=Vinton G.|last3=Clark|first3=David D.|last4=Kahn|first4=Robert E.|last5=Kleinrock|first5=Leonard|last6=Lynch|first6=Daniel C.|last7=Postel|first7=Jon|last8=Roberts|first8=Larry G.|last9=Wolf|first9=Stephen|year=1999|arxiv=cs/9901011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technologies that made the Arpanet possible spread and evolved.

In time, the network spread beyond academic and military institutions and became known as the Internet. The emergence of networking involved a redefinition of the nature and boundaries of the computer. Computer operating systems and applications were modified to include the ability to define and access the resources of other computers on the network, such as peripheral devices, stored information, and the like, as extensions of the resources of an individual computer. Initially these facilities were available primarily to people working in high-tech environments, but in the 1990s the spread of applications like e-mail and the [[World Wide Web]], combined with the development of cheap, fast networking technologies like [[Ethernet]] and [[Asymmetric digital subscriber line|ADSL]] saw computer networking become almost ubiquitous. In fact, the number of computers that are networked is growing phenomenally. A very large proportion of personal computers regularly connect to the Internet to communicate and receive information. "Wireless" networking, often utilizing mobile phone networks, has meant networking is becoming increasingly ubiquitous even in mobile computing environments.

A computer does not need to be [[electronics|electronic]], nor even have a [[Central processing unit|processor]], nor [[Random-access memory|RAM]], nor even a [[hard disk]]. While popular usage of the word "computer" is synonymous with a personal electronic computer, the modern&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (6th ed, 2007), the word ''computer'' dates back to the mid 17th century, when it referred to "A person who makes calculations; specifically a person employed for this in an observatory etc."&lt;/ref&gt; definition of a computer is literally: "''A device that computes'', especially a programmable [usually] electronic machine that performs high-speed mathematical or logical operations or that assembles, stores, correlates, or otherwise processes information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefreedictionary.com/computer |title=Definition of computer|publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any device which ''processes information'' qualifies as a computer, especially if the processing is purposeful.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

== Future ==
There is active research to make computers out of many promising new types of technology, such as [[optical computing|optical computers]], [[DNA computing|DNA computers]], [[wetware computer|neural computers]], and [[quantum computing|quantum computers]]. Most computers are universal, and are able to calculate any [[computable function]], and are limited only by their memory capacity and operating speed. However different designs of computers can give very different performance for particular problems; for example quantum computers can potentially break some modern encryption algorithms (by [[Shor's algorithm|quantum factoring]]) very quickly.

=== Computer architecture paradigms ===
There are many types of [[computer architecture]]s:
* [[Quantum computer]] vs. [[Chemical computer]]
* [[Scalar processor]] vs. [[Vector processor]]
* [[Non-Uniform Memory Access]] (NUMA) computers
* [[Register machine]] vs. [[Stack machine]]
* [[Harvard architecture]] vs. [[von Neumann architecture]]
* [[Cellular architecture]]

Of all these [[abstract machine]]s, a quantum computer holds the most promise for revolutionizing computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=II|first1=Joseph D. Dumas|title=Computer Architecture: Fundamentals and Principles of Computer Design|date=2005|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780849327490|page=340|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZWaUurOwMPQC&amp;q=quantum+computers&amp;q=quantum%20computers|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Logic gates]] are a common abstraction which can apply to most of the above [[Digital data|digital]] or [[analog signal|analog]] paradigms. The ability to store and execute lists of instructions called [[Computer program|programs]] makes computers extremely versatile, distinguishing them from [[calculator]]s. The [[Church–Turing thesis]] is a mathematical statement of this versatility: any computer with a [[Turing-complete|minimum capability (being Turing-complete)]] is, in principle, capable of performing the same tasks that any other computer can perform. Therefore, any type of computer ([[netbook]], [[supercomputer]], [[cellular automaton]], etc.) is able to perform the same computational tasks, given enough time and storage capacity.

=== Artificial intelligence ===
A computer will solve problems in exactly the way it is programmed to, without regard to efficiency, alternative solutions, possible shortcuts, or possible errors in the code. Computer programs that learn and adapt are part of the emerging field of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]]. Artificial intelligence based products generally fall into two major categories: rule based systems and pattern recognition systems. Rule based systems attempt to represent the rules used by human experts and tend to be expensive to develop. Pattern based systems use data about a problem to generate conclusions. Examples of pattern based systems include voice recognition, font recognition, translation and the emerging field of on-line marketing.

== Professions and organizations ==
As the use of computers has spread throughout society, there are an increasing number of careers involving computers.

A '''cognitive computer''' combines [[artificial intelligence]] and machine-learning algorithms, in an approach which attempts to reproduce the behaviour of the human brain.&lt;ref name="modha-ns1"&gt;Dharmendra Modha (interview), "A computer that thinks", ''New Scientist'' 8 November 2014, Pages 28-29&lt;/ref&gt; It generally adopts a [[Neuromorphic engineering]] approach. 
An example of [[neural network]] implementations of cognitive convolution and [[deep learning]] is provided by the [[IBM]] company's [[Watson (computer)|Watson]] machine. A subsequent development by IBM is the [[TrueNorth]] microchip architecture, which is designed to be closer in structure to the human brain than the [[von Neumann architecture]] used in conventional computers.&lt;ref name="modha-ns1" /&gt; In 2017 [[Intel]] announced its own version of a cognitive chip in "Loihi", which will be available to university and research labs in 2018.

==Intel Loihi chip==
Intel's self-learning neuromorphic chip, named Loihi, perhaps named after the Hawaiian seamount [[Loihi]], offers substantial power efficiency designed after the human brain. Intel claims Loihi is about 1000 times more energy efficient than the general-purpose computing power needed to train the neural networks that rival Loihi's performance. 
In theory, this would support both machine learning training and inference on the same silicon independently of a cloud connection, and more efficient than using [[convolutional neural network]]s (CNNs) or [[deep learning]] [[neural network]]s. Intel points to a system for monitoring a person's heartbeat, taking readings after events such as exercise or eating, and uses the cognitive computing chip to normalize the data and work out the ‘normal’ heartbeat. It can then spot abnormalities, but also deal with any new events or conditions.
{{POV section|date=March 2018}}
The first iteration of the Loihi chip was made using Intel's 14&amp;nbsp;nm fabrication process, and houses 128 clusters of 1,024 artificial neurons each for a total of 131,072 simulated neurons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/article/why-intel-built-a-neuromorphic-chip/ "Why Intel built a neuromorphic chip". September 29, 2017. www.ZDNet.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This offers around 130 million synapses, which is still a rather long way from the human brain's 800 trillion synapses, and behind IBM's [[TrueNorth]], which has around 16 billion by using  64 by 4,096 cores.&lt;ref&gt;[https://aitrends.com/future-of-ai/intel-unveils-loihi-neuromorphic/ "Intel unveils Loihi neuromorphic chip, chases IBM in artificial brains". October 17, 2017. AITrends.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
Loihi is now available for research purposes among more than 40 academic research groups as a [[USB]] from factor.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.top500.org/news/intel-ramps-up-neuromorphic-computing-effort-with-new-research-partners/&lt;/ref&gt;

==IBM TrueNorth Chip==
{{main|TrueNorth}}
The IBM cognitive computers implement learning using [[Hebbian theory]].  Instead of being programmable in a traditional sense within [[machine language]] or a higher level [[programming language]] such a device learns by inputting instances through an [[input device]] that are aggregated within a computational [[convolution]] or [[neural network]] architecture consisting of weights within a parallel memory system.  An early instantiation of such a device has been developed in 2012 under the [[Darpa]] [[SyNAPSE]] program at IBM directed by [[Dharmendra Modha]].
In 2017 this IBM 64-chip [[array data structure|array]] will contain the processing equivalent of 64 million neurons and 16 billion synapses, yet  each processor consumes just 10 watts of electricity.
Like other neural networks, this system will be put to use in pattern recognition and sensory processing roles. The Air Force wants to combine the [[TrueNorth]] ability to convert multiple data feeds &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;whether it's audio, video or text&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; into machine readable symbols with a conventional supercomputer's ability to crunch data.
This isn't the first time that IBM's neural chip system has been integrated into cutting-edge technology. In August, 2017 [[Samsung]] installed the chips in its Dynamic Vision Sensors enabling cameras to capture images at up to 2,000 fps while using just 300 milliwatts of power.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/233747-samsung-demonstrates-camera-sensors-hooked-to-ibms-brain-imitating-silicon&lt;/ref&gt;

Google has created three generations of a similar device, [[Tensor processing unit]] using low resolution, 8 bit computing rather than a [[Spiking neural network]].

==Criticism==
There are many approaches and definitions for a '''cognitive computer''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schank|first1=Roger C.|last2=Childers|first2=Peter G.|title=The cognitive computer: on language, learning, and artificial intelligence|publisher=Addison-Wesley Pub. Co.|date=1984|isbn=9780201064438|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9oFQAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=cognitive+computer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other approaches may be more fruitful than the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Stephen|title=The Cognitive Computer: On Language, Learning, and Artificial Intelligence by Roger C. Schank, Peter Childers (review)|journal=Leonardo|date=1988|volume=21|issue=2|page=210|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/600644/summary|accessdate=13 January 2017|issn=1530-9282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, there are critics who argue that a room-sized computer - like the case of Watson - is not a viable alternative to a three-pound human brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metaskills: Five Talents for the Robotic Age|last=Neumeier|first=Marty|publisher=New Riders|year=2012|isbn=9780133359329|location=Indianapolis, IN|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some also cite the difficulty for a single system to bring so many elements together such as the disparate sources of information as well as computing resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cognitive Computing and Big Data Analytics|last=Hurwitz|first=Judith|last2=Kaufman|first2=Marcia|last3=Bowles|first3=Adrian|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2015|isbn=9781118896624|location=Indianapolis, IN|pages=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2018 [[World Economic Forum]], there are experts who claim that cognitive systems could adopt the biases of their developers and this was demonstrated in the case of the [[Google]] [[Computer vision|image-recognition]] or computer vision algorithm, which identified [[African Americans]] unfavorably.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/18/world-economic-forum-ai-has-a-bias-problem-that-needs-to-be-fixed.html|title=A.I. has a bias problem that needs to be fixed: World Economic Forum|last=Choudhury|first=Saheli Roy|date=2018-09-18|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microcomputers became popular in the 1970s and 1980s with the advent of increasingly powerful microprocessors. The predecessors to these computers, [[mainframe computer|mainframe]]s and [[minicomputer]]s, were comparatively much larger and more expensive (though indeed present-day mainframes such as the [[IBM System z]] machines use one or more custom microprocessors as their CPUs). Many microcomputers (when equipped with a [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] and [[Computer monitor|screen]] for input and output) are also [[personal computer]]s (in the generic sense).&lt;ref name="personalcomputer"&gt;An early use of the term ''personal computer'' in 1962 predates microprocessor-based designs. ''(See "Personal Computer: Computers at Companies" reference below)''.  A ''microcomputer'' used as an embedded control system may have no human-readable input and output devices.  "Personal computer" may be used generically or may denote an [[IBM PC compatible]] machine.&lt;/ref&gt;

The abbreviation ''micro'' was common during the 1970s and 1980s,&lt;ref name="microvalid"&gt;Proof of "micro" as a once-common term:&lt;br /&gt;(i) Direct reference: Graham Kibble-White, [http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/oldott/www.offthetelly.co.uk/index7943.html?page_id=568 "Stand by for a Data-Blast"], Off the Telly.

Other books include Usborne's [https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0860206378 "Understanding the Micro"] ({{ISBN|0-86020-637-8}}), a children's guide to microcomputers.&lt;/ref&gt; but has now fallen out of common usage.

== Origins ==
The term ''microcomputer'' came into popular use after the introduction of the [[minicomputer]], although [[Isaac Asimov]] used the term in his short story "[[The Dying Night]]" as early as 1956 (published in ''The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction'' in July that year).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|title=The Dying Night|journal=The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction|date=July 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, the microcomputer replaced the many separate components that made up the minicomputer's CPU with one integrated microprocessor [[integrated circuit|chip]].

The French developers of the [[Micral]] N (1973) filed their patents with the term "Micro-ordinateur", a literal equivalent of "Microcomputer", to designate a solid state machine designed with a microprocessor.
In the USA, the earliest models such as the [[Altair 8800]] were often sold as kits to be assembled by the user, and came with as little as 256 [[byte]]s of [[random access memory|RAM]], and no [[input/output]] devices other than indicator lights and switches, useful as a [[proof of concept]] to demonstrate what such a simple device could do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ceruzzi|first=Paul|title=Computing: a concise history|year=2012|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=9780262517676|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, as microprocessors and [[semiconductor memory]] became less expensive, microcomputers in turn grew cheaper and easier to use:
* Increasingly inexpensive logic chips such as the [[7400 series]] allowed cheap dedicated circuitry for improved [[user interface]]s such as [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] input, instead of simply a row of switches to toggle bits one at a time.
* Use of [[audio cassette]]s for inexpensive data storage replaced manual re-entry of a program every time the device was powered on.
* Large cheap arrays of silicon [[logic gates]] in the form of [[read-only memory]] and [[EPROM]]s allowed utility programs and self-[[booting]] [[kernel (computing)|kernel]]s to be stored within microcomputers. These [[stored program]]s could automatically load further more complex software from external storage devices without user intervention, to form an inexpensive [[turnkey system]] that does not require a computer expert to understand or to use the device.
* [[Random access memory]] became cheap enough to afford dedicating approximately 1-2 kilobytes of memory to a [[video display controller]] [[frame buffer]], for a 40x25 or 80x25 text display or blocky color graphics on a common household [[television]]. This replaced the slow, complex, and expensive [[teletypewriter]] that was previously common as an interface to minicomputers and mainframes.
All these improvements in cost and usability resulted in an explosion in their popularity during the late 1970s and early 1980s.
A large number of computer makers packaged microcomputers for use in small business  applications. By 1979, many companies such as [[Cromemco]], [[Processor Technology]], [[IMSAI]], [[North Star Computers]], [[SWTPC|Southwest Technical Products Corporation]], [[Ohio Scientific]], [[Altos Computer Systems]], [[Morrow Designs]] and others produced systems designed either for a resourceful end user or consulting firm to deliver business systems such as accounting, database management, and word processing to small businesses. This allowed businesses unable to afford leasing of a minicomputer or [[time-sharing]] service the opportunity to automate business functions, without (usually) hiring a full-time staff to operate the computers. A representative system of this era would have used an [[S100 bus]], an 8-bit processor such as an [[Intel 8080]] or [[Zilog Z80]], and either [[CP/M]] or [[MP/M]] operating system.
The increasing availability and power of [[desktop computer]]s for personal use attracted the attention of more software developers.  In time, and as the industry matured, the market for [[personal computer]]s standardized around [[IBM PC compatible]]s running [[DOS]], and later [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].
Modern desktop computers, [[video game console]]s, [[laptop]]s, [[tablet computer|tablet PC]]s, and many types of [[handheld device]]s, including [[mobile phone]]s, pocket [[calculator]]s, and industrial [[embedded system]]s, may all be considered examples of microcomputers according to the definition given above.

== Colloquial use of the term ==

Everyday use of the expression "microcomputer" (and in particular the "micro" abbreviation) has declined significantly from the mid-1980s and has declined in commonplace usage since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/117935?redirectedFrom=microcomputer microcomputer]". OED Online. December 2013. Oxford University Press. 15 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most commonly associated with the first wave of all-in-one [[8-bit]] [[home computer]]s and small business microcomputers (such as the [[Apple II family|Apple II]], [[Commodore 64]], [[BBC Micro]], and [[TRS 80]]). Although, or perhaps because, an increasingly diverse range of modern microprocessor-based devices fit the definition of "microcomputer", they are no longer referred to as such in everyday speech.

In common usage, "microcomputer" has been largely supplanted by the term "[[personal computer]]" or "PC", which specifies a computer that has been designed to be used by one individual at a time, a term first coined in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/262572?redirectedFrom=personal+computer personal computer]". OED Online. December 2013. Oxford University Press. 15 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; IBM first promoted the term "personal computer" to differentiate themselves from other microcomputers, often called "[[home computer]]s", and also IBM's own mainframes and minicomputers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} However, following its release, the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] itself was widely imitated, as well as the term.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} The component parts were commonly available to producers and the [[BIOS]] was [[reverse engineered]] through [[cleanroom design]] techniques. [[IBM PC compatible]] "clones" became commonplace, and the terms "personal computer", and especially "PC", stuck with the general public, often specifically for a DOS or (nowadays) Windows-compatible computer.

Since the advent of [[microcontroller]]s (monolithic integrated circuits containing RAM, ROM and CPU all onboard), the term "micro" is more commonly used to refer to that meaning.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

== Description ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}
Monitors, keyboards and other devices for input and output may be integrated or separate. Computer memory in the form of [[RAM]], and at least one other less volatile, memory storage device are usually combined with the CPU on a [[system bus]] in one unit. Other devices that make up a complete microcomputer system include batteries, a [[power supply]] unit, a keyboard and various input/output devices used to convey information to and from a human operator ([[computer printer|printers]], [[computer display|monitors]], [[human interface device]]s).  Microcomputers are designed to serve only one user at a time, although they can often be modified with software or hardware to concurrently serve more than one user.  Microcomputers fit well on or under desks or tables, so that they are within easy access of users.  Bigger computers like [[minicomputer]]s, [[mainframe computer|mainframes]], and [[supercomputer]]s take up large [[cabinet (computer)|cabinet]]s or even dedicated rooms.

A microcomputer comes equipped with at least one type of data storage, usually [[random-access memory|RAM]].  Although some microcomputers (particularly early 8-bit home micros) perform  tasks using RAM alone, some form of [[secondary storage]] is normally desirable. In the early days of home micros, this was often a data [[cassette deck]] (in many cases as an external unit). Later, secondary storage (particularly in the form of [[floppy disk]] and [[hard disk]] drives) were built into the microcomputer case.

== History ==

[[Image:Early Personal Computers.jpg|thumb|320px|right|A collection of early microcomputers, including a [[Processor Technology]] SOL-20 (top shelf, right), an MITS [[Altair 8800]] (second shelf, left), a [[TV Typewriter]] (third shelf, center), and an [[Apple I]] in the case at far right.]]

===TTL precursors===
Although they did not contain any microprocessors, but were built around [[transistor-transistor logic]] (TTL), [[Hewlett-Packard]] calculators as far back as 1968 had various levels of programmability comparable to microcomputers. The HP 9100B (1968) had rudimentary conditional (if) statements, statement line numbers, jump statements ([[go to]]), registers that could be used as variables, and primitive subroutines. The programming language resembled [[assembly language]] in many ways. Later models incrementally added more features, including the [[BASIC]] programming language (HP 9830A in 1971). Some models had tape storage and small printers. However, displays were limited to one line at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpmuseum.org|title=The Museum of HP Calculators}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hewlett Packard 9100A|HP 9100A]] was referred to as a [[personal computer]] in an advertisement in a 1968 [[Science (journal)|Science]] magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/histnfacts/museum/personalsystems/0021/other/0021ad.pdf |title=Powerful Computing Genie|publisher = Hewlett Packard |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that advertisement was quickly dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/issue_pdf/frontmatter_pdf/162/3852.pdf |title=Restoring the Balance Between Analysis and Computation |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  HP was reluctant to sell them as "computers" because the perception at that time was that a computer had to be big in size to be powerful, and thus decided to market them as calculators.  Additionally, at that time, people were more likely to buy calculators than computers, and, purchasing agents also preferred the term "calculator" because purchasing a "computer" required additional layers of purchasing authority approvals.

The [[Datapoint 2200]], made by [[Datapoint|CTC]] in 1970, was also comparable to microcomputers.  While it contains no microprocessor, the [[instruction set]] of its custom TTL processor was the basis of the instruction set for the [[Intel 8008]], and for practical purposes the system behaves approximately as if it contains an 8008.  This is because Intel was the contractor in charge of developing the Datapoint's CPU, but ultimately CTC rejected the 8008 design because it needed 20 support chips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computermuseum.li/Testpage/MicroprocessorHistory.htm |title=MicroprocessorHistory |publisher=Computermuseum.li |date=1971-11-15 |accessdate=2012-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923205820/http://www.computermuseum.li/Testpage/MicroprocessorHistory.htm |archivedate=2015-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early system, the [[Kenbak-1]], was released in 1971. Like the Datapoint 2200, it used discrete [[transistor–transistor logic]] instead of a microprocessor, but it functioned like a microcomputer in some ways. It was marketed as an educational and hobbyist tool, but it was not a commercial success; production ceased shortly after introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vintage-computer.com/kenbak-1.shtml|title=Kenbak-1|website=The Vintage Computer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early microcomputers===
In late 1972, a French team headed by [[François Gernelle]] within a small company, Réalisations &amp; Etudes Electroniqes (R2E), developed and patented a computer based on a microprocessor – the Intel 8008 8-bit microprocessor. This [[Micral|Micral-N]] was marketed in early 1973 as a "Micro-ordinateur" or ''microcomputer'', mainly for scientific and process-control applications. About a hundred [[Micral|Micral-N]] were installed in the next two years, followed by a new version based on the Intel 8080. Meanwhile, another French team developed the Alvan, a small computer for office automation which found clients in banks and other sectors. The first version was based on LSI chips with an Intel 8008 as peripheral controller (keyboard, monitor and printer), before adopting the [[Zilog Z80]] as main processor.

In late 1972, a Sacramento State University team led by Bill Pentz built the Sac State 8008 computer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digibarn.com/stories/bill-pentz-story/index.html |title=Digibarn Stories: Bill Pentz and (Earliest) History of the Microcomputer (August 2008) |publisher=Digibarn.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; able to handle thousands of patients' medical records.  The Sac State 8008 was designed with the Intel 8008. It had a full set of hardware and software components: a disk operating system included in a series of programmable read-only memory chips (PROMs); 8 Kilobytes of RAM; IBM's Basic Assembly Language (BAL); a hard drive; a color display; a printer output; a 150 bit/s serial interface for connecting to a mainframe; and even the world's first microcomputer front panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Terdiman |first=Daniel |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-10429544-52.html |title=Inside the world's long-lost first microcomputer &amp;#124; Geek Gestalt&amp;nbsp;— CNET News |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=2010-01-08 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1973, [[Sord Computer Corporation]] (now [[Toshiba|Toshiba Personal Computer System Corporation]]) completed the SMP80/08, which used the [[Intel 8008]] microprocessor. The SMP80/08, however, did not have a commercial release. After the first general-purpose microprocessor, the [[Intel 8080]], was announced in April 1974, Sord announced the SMP80/x, the first microcomputer to use the 8080, in May 1974.&lt;ref name="ipsj"&gt;http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/computer/personal/0086.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtually all early microcomputers were essentially boxes with lights and switches; one had to read and understand binary numbers and machine language to program and use them (the Datapoint 2200 was a striking exception, bearing a modern design based on a monitor, keyboard, and tape and disk drives).  Of the early "box of switches"-type microcomputers, the MITS [[Altair 8800]] (1975) was arguably the most famous.  Most of these simple, early microcomputers were sold as [[electronic kits]]—bags full of loose components which the buyer had to solder together before the system could be used.

The period from about 1971 to 1976 is sometimes called the [[:Category:Early microcomputers|first generation]] of microcomputers. Many companies such as [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There were also machines for engineering development and hobbyist personal use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kawCnk4051wC&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;pg=PA154#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Computer Adventures|last=Hawkins|first = William J.|date = December 1983|magazine = Popular Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, the [[Processor Technology]] [[SOL-20]] was designed, which consisted of one board which included all the parts of the computer system. The [[SOL-20]] had built-in EPROM software which eliminated the need for rows of switches and lights. The [[Altair 8800|MITS Altair]] just mentioned played an instrumental role in sparking significant hobbyist interest, which itself eventually led to the founding and success of many well-known [[personal computer]] hardware and software companies, such as [[Microsoft]] and [[Apple Computer]]. Although the Altair itself was only a mild commercial success, it helped spark a huge industry.

===Home computers===
By 1977, the introduction of the second generation, known as [[home computer]]s, made microcomputers considerably easier to use than their predecessors because their predecessors' operation often demanded thorough familiarity with practical electronics. The ability to connect to a monitor (screen) or TV set allowed visual manipulation of text and numbers. The [[BASIC]] language, which was easier to learn and use than raw machine language, became a standard feature. These features were already common in [[minicomputer]]s, with which many hobbyists and early produces were familiar.

In 1979, the launch of the [[VisiCalc]] [[spreadsheet]] (initially for the [[Apple II family|Apple II]]) first turned the microcomputer from a hobby for computer enthusiasts into a business tool. After the 1981 release by IBM of its [[IBM PC]], the term [[personal computer]] became generally used for microcomputers compatible with the IBM PC architecture ([[PC compatible]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8359">The word '''''[[data]]''''' has generated considerable controversy on whether it is an uncountable noun used with verbs conjugated in the singular, or should be treated as the plural of the now-rarely-used ''datum''.

==Usage in English==
In one sense, ''data'' is the [[plural form]] of ''datum''. ''Datum'' actually can also be a [[count noun]] with the plural ''datums'' (see usage in [[datum (geodesy)|datum]] article) that can be used with cardinal numbers (e.g. "80 datums"); ''data'' (originally a Latin plural) is not used like a normal count noun with cardinal numbers and can be plural with such plural determiners as ''these'' and ''many'' or as an [[uncountable noun]] with a verb in the [[Grammatical number|singular]] form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = | title =[[Merriam–Webster's Dictionary of English Usage]]| year = 2002 | publisher = Merriam-Webster | location = Springfield, Massachusetts | isbn = 978-0-87779-132-4| pages = 317–318 | chapter = data, datum}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Even when a very small quantity of data is referenced (one number, for example), the phrase ''piece of data'' is often used, as opposed to ''datum''. The debate over appropriate usage continues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Data is a singular noun |url=http://nxg.me.uk/note/2005/singular-data/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Grammarist: Data |url=http://www.grammarist.com/usage/data/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dictionary.com Data |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/data}}&lt;/ref&gt; but "data" as a singular form is far more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/elitist-superfluous-or-popular-we-polled-americans-on-the-oxford-comma/|title=Elitist, Superfluous, Or Popular? We Polled Americans on the Oxford Comma|work=FiveThirtyEight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[English language|English]], the word ''datum'' is still used in the general sense of "an item given". In [[cartography]], [[geography]], [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] and [[technical drawing]], it is often used to refer to a single specific [[Datum reference|reference datum]] from which distances to all other data are measured. Any measurement or result is a ''datum'', though ''data point'' is now far more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Matt Dye |year=2001 |title=Writing Reports |url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/DeafStudiesTeaching/dissert/Writing%20Reports.htm |publisher=[[University of Bristol]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Data'' is most often used as a singular mass noun in everyday usage.&lt;ref&gt;New Oxford Dictionary of English, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"...in educated everyday usage as represented by the Guardian newspaper, it is nowadays most often used as a singular." http://www.lexically.net/TimJohns/Kibbitzer/revis006.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Some major newspapers, such as ''[[The New York Times]],'' use it either in the singular or plural. In the ''New York Times'' the phrases "the survey data are still being analyzed" and "the first year for which data is available" &lt;!-- the verb there is singular because the subject is "year", not "data", so that is a bad example of a singular "data".--&gt;have appeared within one day.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news |year=2009 |title=When Serving the Lord, Ministers Are Often Found to Neglect Themselves |publisher=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/10/us/10religion.html }}{{cite news |year=2009 |title=Investment Tax Cuts Help Mostly the Rich |publisher=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/10/business/10charts.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' explicitly allows this usage in its style guide.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Associated Press]] style guide classifies ''data'' as a collective noun that takes the singular when treated as a unit but the plural when referring to individual items (e.g., "The data is sound" and "The data have been carefully collected").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = The Associated Press | authorlink = Associated Press | editor = Norm Goldstein | title = The Associated Press Stylebook and Briefing on Media Law |date=June 2002 | publisher = Perseus | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 0-7382-0740-3 | page = 52 | chapter = collective nouns }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[scientific writing]] ''data'' is often treated as a plural, as in ''These data do not support the conclusions'', but the word is also used as a singular mass entity like ''information'', for instance in computing and related disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = |  editor = R.W.

The '''motion history image''' (MHI) is a static image template helps in understanding the [[Motion (physics)|motion]] location and path as it progresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/CVL/Research/MHI/mhi.html | title=Research: Motion History Images | accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In MHI, the temporal motion information is collapsed into a single image template where intensity is a function of recency of motion. Thus, the MHI pixel intensity is a function of the motion history at that location, where brighter values correspond to a more recent motion. Using MHI, moving parts of a [[video]] sequence can be engraved with a single image, from where one can predict the motion flow as well as the moving parts of the video action.

Some important features of the MHI representation are:&lt;ref&gt;Ahad, Md Atiqur Rahman. Motion history images for action recognition and understanding. Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* It represents motion sequence in a compact manner. In this case, the [[silhouette]] sequence is condensed into a [[grayscale]] image, where dominant motion information is preserved. 
* MHI can be created and implemented in low illumination conditions where the structure cannot be easily detected otherwise. 
* The MHI representation is not so sensitive to silhouette noises, holes, shadows, and missing parts. 
* The gray-scale MHI is sensitive to the direction of motion because it can demonstrate the flow direction of the motion. 
* It keeps a history of temporal changes at each pixel location, which then decays over time. 
* The MHI expresses the motion flow or sequence by using the intensity of every pixel in a temporal manner.

"'''Computer Says No'''", or the "'''Computer says no attitude'''", is the popular name given to an attitude seen in some public-facing organisations where the default response to a customer’s request is to check with information stored on or generated by a computer, and then make decisions based on that, often in the face of [[common sense]].

There may also be an element of deliberate unhelpfulness towards customers and service-users, whereby more ''could'' be done to reach a mutually satisfactory outcome, but is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Computer+says+no+but+we+need+our+say%3b+BEHIND+THE+HEADLINES.-a0214819160 |title=Computer Says No but We Need Our Say |work=[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]] |date=20 December 2009|last=Bird|first=Jackie |via=[[Free Online Library]] |accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name gained popularity through the British [[sketch comedy]] ''[[Little Britain]]''.&lt;ref name=bank&gt;{{cite web|author=Bank accounts |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/bank-accounts/10324271/Who-to-blame-when-computer-says-no.html |title=Who to blame when 'computer says no'? |work=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Little Britain'' ==
In ''Little Britain'', "Computer Says No" is the catchphrase of the character [[Carol Beer]] (played by [[David Walliams]]), a bank worker and later holiday rep and hospital receptionist, who always responds to a customer's enquiry by typing it into her computer and responding with "Computer Says No" to even the most reasonable of requests. When asked to do something aside from asking the computer, she would shrug and remain obstinate in her unhelpfulness, and ultimately cough in the customer's face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was also used in the Australian [[soap opera]] ''[[Neighbours]]'' in 2006 as a reference to ''Little Britain''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neighboursepisodes.com/index.php?year=2006&amp;episode=5023 |title=Neighbours Episode 5023 from 2006 |publisher=NeighboursEpisodes.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage== 
The "Computer Says No" attitude often comes from larger companies that rely on information stored electronically. When this information is not updated, it can often lead to refusals of financial products or incorrect information being sent out to customers.&lt;ref name=bank /&gt; These situations can often be resolved by an employee updating the information; however, when this cannot be done easily, the "Computer Says No" attitude can be viewed as becoming prevalent when there is unhelpfulness as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peachey |first=Kevin |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8105015.stm |title=When the bank's computer says no |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-06-17 |accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude can also occur when an employee fails to read human emotion in the customer and reacts according to his or her professional training&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kane |first=Pat |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn28437-professionals-your-time-is-up-prepare-to-be-sidelined-by-tech/ |title=Professionals, your time is up, prepare to be sidelined by tech |work=New Scientist |date=2015-11-03 |accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; or relies upon a script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lythe |first=Ruth |url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-3210669/The-lives-wrecked-COMPUTER-SAYS-NO-Major-report-reveals-human-toll-inflexible-customer-service-banks-insurers.html |title=The lives wrecked because COMPUTER SAYS NO: Major report reveals human toll of inflexible customer service by banks and insurers |publisher=This is Money |date= |accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude also crops up when larger companies rely on computer credit scores and do not meet with a customer to discuss his or her individual needs, instead basing a decision upon information stored in computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mortgages: 'Computer says no' issues hitting the self-employed|url=https://www.scotsman.com/business/mortgages-computer-says-no-issues-hitting-the-self-employed-1-1803711|website=[[The Scotsman]]|accessdate=12 January 2018|language=en|date=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some organisations attempt to offset this attitude by moving away from reliance on electronic information and using a human approach towards requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-31412044.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220213055/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-31412044.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-02-20 |title=Planners' move from 'computer says no' response is welcome |work=Mid-Devon Gazette |subscription=yes |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |date= |accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Computer Says No" happens in a more literal sense when computer systems employ filters that prevent messages being passed along, as when these messages are perceived to include obscenities. When information is not passed through to the person operating the computer, decisions may be made without seeing the whole picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=18:57, 15 Feb 2007 Updated 14:04, 12 Jan 2013 |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/computer-says-no-to-rude-word-1030900 |title='Computer says no' to rude word |work=Manchester Evening News |date= |accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computer rage''' refers to negative psychological responses towards a computer due to heightened [[anger]] or [[frustration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://129.2.36.150/trons/hcil22oct2004/hcilbbl_10_22_2004.pdf|title = Computer Rage: Theory and Practice|date = October 21, 2004|accessdate = November 2, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = Norman|first = Kent L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of computer rage include cursing or yelling at a computer, slamming or throwing keyboards and mice, and assaulting the computer or monitor with an object or weapon.

== Notable cases ==
In April 2015, a Colorado man was cited for firing a gun within a residential area when he took his computer into a back alley and shot it eight times with a 9mm pistol.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Enraged Man Shoots Computer Eight Times|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/22/man-shoots-computer-eight-times_n_7119246.html|newspaper = [[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate = 2015-11-03|date = 2015-04-22|last1 = Grenoble|first1 = Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt; When questioned, he told police that he had become so frustrated with his computer that he had "reached critical mass," and stated that after he had shot his computer, "the angels sung on high."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Colorado man ticketed for shooting his computer; says it was worth it|url = http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-colorado-shooting-computer-20150421-story.html|website = latimes.com|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a German man threw his computer out the window in the middle of the night, startling his neighbors. German police were sympathetic and did not press charges, stating "Who hasn't felt like doing that?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sympathetic police pardon man who threw computer out of window|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-469022/Sympathetic-police-pardon-man-threw-window.html|website = [[Mail Online]]|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Veneziani|first1=Vince|title=German Throws Computer Out Window, Escapes Fine|url=https://techcrunch.com/2007/07/18/german-throws-computer-out-window-escapes-fine/|publisher=[[Tech Crunch]]|accessdate=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the staged surveillance video "[[Bad Day (viral video)|Bad Day]]", showing a man assaulting his computer at work, became a [[viral video|viral hit]] on the Internet, reaching over two million views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Viral Video Breakdown |url=http://www.views4video.com/viral-video-breakdown |date=2013-07-25 |accessdate=2015-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725183339/http://www.views4video.com/viral-video-breakdown |archivedate=July 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other instances of reported computer rage have ranged from a restaurant owner who threw his laptop into a deep fryer, to an individual who threw his computer out the window, but forgot that the window was closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Drop the mouse and step away from the PC |url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7329279/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/t/drop-mouse-step-away-pc/#.VjgZQ7erSUk|website = msnbc.com|accessdate = 2015-11-11|date = 2005-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence ==
In 1999, it was speculated that computer rage had become more common than [[road rage]] in traffic,&lt;ref name="People Management"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.cipd.co.uk/pm/peoplemanagement/b/weblog/archive/2013/01/29/4092a-1999-06.aspx |title= Computer rage grows as millions misspent on IT |date= June 17, 1999 |accessdate= November 2, 2015 |website=[[People Management Magazine]] |publisher= |last= |first= |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170703025756/http://www.cipd.co.uk/pm/peoplemanagement/b/weblog/archive/2013/01/29/4092a-1999-06.aspx |archivedate= July 3, 2017 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in a 2015 study, it was found that reported rates of anger when using a computer were lower than reported rates of anger while driving. However, reports of anger while driving or using computers were found to be far more common than anger in other situations.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

In a 2013 survey of American adults, 36% of respondents who reported experiencing computer issues, also reported that they had screamed, yelled, cursed, or physically assaulted their computers within the last six months.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web |title= Over A Third of Americans Confess to Verbal or Physical Abuse—of Their Computers: New Harris Study Reveals the Extent of Frustration, Anger and Helplessness Spurred by Computer Problems |url= https://www.bulldogreporter.com/over-a-third-of-americans-confess-to-verbal-or-physical-abuse-of-their-computers |website= Bulldog Reporter |accessdate= 2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a survey was conducted with British computer users about their experiences with computers. This survey found that 54% of respondents reported verbally abusing their computers, and 40% reported that they had become physically violent toward their computers. The survey also found that most users experienced computer rage three to four times a month.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news |title= 'Computer rage' affects more than half of Britons |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/5086091/Computer-rage-affects-more-than-half-of-Britons.html |website= Telegraph.co.uk |accessdate= 2015-11-03|date= April 2009 |last1= Wardrop |first1= Murray }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences in types of computer rage have also been found between different geographical regions. For example, one survey found that individuals from London have been found to be five times more likely to physically assault their computers, while those from [[Yorkshire]] and [[Humberside]] were found to be more likely to yell at their computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Computer anger: Northerners shout, Southerners lash out {{!}} ZDNet |url= http://www.zdnet.com/article/computer-anger-northerners-shout-southerners-lash-out |website= [[ZDNet]] |accessdate= 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences have also been observed for age groups, as younger adults (18–24 years old) have reported more abusive behaviors in the face of computer frustration when compared to older adults (over 35 years old).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Individuals with less computer experience in particular have also been reported to experience increased feelings of anger and helplessness when it comes to computers,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web |title= No. It's Not OK Computer!

In 1999 Professor Robert J. Edelmann, a Chartered Clinical, Forensic and Health Psychologist and a Fellow of the British Psychological Society, was offering a special helpline in the UK for those suffering from technology related anger.&lt;ref name="Ipsos"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/employees-get-it-out-their-systems |title= Employees Get 'It' Out Of Their Systems.

== Causes ==

=== Computer factors ===

Users can experience computer anger and frustration for a number of reasons. American adults surveyed in 2013 reported that almost half (46%) of their computer problems were due to [[malware]] or [[computer viruses]], followed by software issues (10%) and [[Memory management|not enough memory]] (8%).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Survey: Over A Third of Americans Confess to Verbal or Physical Abuse of Their Computers |url = http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130730005132/en/Survey-Americans-Confess-Verbal-Physical-Abuse-Computers|website = [[Business Wire]] |accessdate = 2015-11-03|date = 2013-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another survey, users reported email, word processors, web browsing, [[operating system crashes]], inability to locate features, and program crashes as frequent initiators of computer frustration.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://hcil2.cs.umd.edu/trs/2002-18/2002-18.pdf|title = Severity and Impact of Computer User Frustration: A Comparison of Student and Workplace Users|last = Lazar|first = Jonathan|date = December 23, 2004|journal = Interacting with Computers|volume = 18|issue = 2|pages = 187–207|doi = 10.1016/j.intcom.2005.06.001|pmid = |access-date = November 10, 2015|last2 = Jones|first2 = Adam; Hackley, Mary; Shneiderman, Ben.|hdl = 1903/6496}}&lt;/ref&gt; These technical issues, paired with tight timelines, poor work progress, and failure to complete a computer task can create heightened computer anger and frustration.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; When this anger and frustration exceeds a person's control, it can turn into rage.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://cognitron.umd.edu/trons/twt8apr2005/twt_04_08_2005.pdf|title = Computer Rage: A Student Response to Frustration with Technology|date = February 16, 2005|accessdate = November 2, 2015|website = |publisher = [[Laboratory for Automation Psychology]], [[University of Maryland Human–Computer Interaction Lab|HCIL]]-V |last = Norman|first = Kent L. | authorlink = Kent Norman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological factors ===

Research on emotion has shown that anger is often caused by interruptions of plans and expectations, especially through the violation of [[Norm (social)|social norms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Anger and aggression: An essay on emotion|last = Averill|first = James R.|publisher = Springer-Verlag New York|year = 1982|isbn = 978-1-4612-5745-5|location = New York|pages = XIV–402}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sense of anger can be magnified when the individual does not understand why they are unable to meet their goal or task at hand or why there was a violation of social norms. Psychologists have argued that this is particularly relevant to computer rage, as computer users interact with computers in a similar manner that they interact with other people&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Machines and Mindlessness: Social Responses to Computers|journal = Journal of Social Issues|date = 2000-01-01|issn = 1540-4560|pages = 81–103|volume = 56|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/0022-4537.00153|first = Clifford|last = Nass|first2 = Youngme|last2 = Moon}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for more information, see [[The Media Equation]]). Thus, when computers fail to function in the face of incoming deadlines or an important task to accomplish, users can feel betrayed by the computer in the same way they can feel betrayed by other people. Specifically, when users fail to understand why their computer will not work properly, often in the times they need it to the most, it can invoke a sense of hostility as it is interpreted as a breach of social norms or a personal attack.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Does computing anger have social elements? A comparison with driving anger|journal = Behaviour &amp; Information Technology|pages = 294–303|volume = 34|issue = 3|doi = 10.1080/0144929x.2014.895421|first = John P.|last = Charlton|first2 = Arvid|last2 = Kappas|first3 = Aleksandra|last3 = Swiderska|year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Consistent with this finding, perceived betrayal by the computer can also elicit other negative emotions. One survey of US adults reported that 10% of users who experience computer issues experienced feeling helplessness, and 4% reported feeling victimized. In the same survey, 7% adults ages 18–34 reported that they had cried over their computer problems within the previous six months.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Dangers and potential benefits ==
Computer rage can result in damaged property or physical injuries, as well as psychological harm.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some experts have suggested that venting frustrations on the computer may have some benefits, but other experts disagree. For example, yelling at the computer has been suggested as a way to moderate one's anger to avoid the ill effects of anger suppression,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; but new research has suggested that yelling can negatively affect health in itself.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Alternatively, releasing anger on a computer has been viewed as advantageous as it directs this rage at an object as opposed to another person, and can make individuals feel better afterwards.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Prevention and management ==
In response to computer issues that invoke frustration, some experts have suggested walking away from the computer for 15 minutes to "cool off".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Drop the mouse and step away from the PC|url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7329279/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/t/drop-mouse-step-away-pc/#.Vjgy5berSUl|website = msnbc.com|accessdate = 2015-11-03|date = 2005-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other methods to prevent computer rage can be backing up computer data often,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/2005-06-03-computer-rage_x.htm|title = Got computer rage? Expert suggests safe ways to vent|date = June 3, 2005|accessdate = November 2, 2015|website = USATODAY|publisher = |last = Davia|first = Joy}}&lt;/ref&gt; increasing memory of the computer,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and even imagining pleasant images, such as petting an animal.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Adopting a goal of improving computer knowledge may also be beneficial, as users are less likely to report computer rage when they view the issue as a challenge and not as a setback.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; If computer rage cannot be avoided, guidelines on how to rage with minimal consequences, such as wearing safety goggles and taking frustration out on older equipment, can be followed to reduce the likelihood of injury and significant property loss.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Employers of staff who work with computers, often in situations where time is crucial, can take steps to prevent computer rage, such as making sure there is adequate software, and providing employees with anger management strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The determinants and expression of computer-related anger|journal = Computers in Human Behavior|date = 2009-11-01|pages = 1213–1221|volume = 25|issue = 6|doi = 10.1016/j.chb.2009.07.001|first = John P.|last = Charlton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some computer technician companies have reported that, to reduce computer rage, their technicians are trained on how to work with customers in sensitive psychological states just as much as how to diagnose and fix technical issues.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Repair Teams Try to Calm 'Computer Rage'|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/04/30/AR2005043001119.html|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2005-05-01|access-date = 2015-11-03|issn = 0190-8286|first = Ariana Eunjung|last = Cha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Designing computer interfaces to display more emotional support when errors occur, or provide therapy strategies, has also been suggested as a way to mitigate computer anger and rage.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The application of [[affective computing]] has been shown to effectively mitigate negative emotions connected to computer use. One study found that an interface that sought the user's feelings, provided [[empathy]], and validated reported emotional states significantly reduced negative emotions associated with computer frustration for users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = This computer responds to user frustration: Theory, design, and results|url = http://iwc.oxfordjournals.org/content/14/2/119|journal = Interacting with Computers|date = 2002-02-01|issn = 0953-5438|pages = 119–140|volume = 14|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/S0953-5438(01)00053-4|first = J.|last = Klein|first2 = Y.|last2 = Moon|first3 = R. W.|last3 = Picard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that when error messages contain positive wording ("Great that the computer will soon work again") compared to negative wording ("This is frustrating") or a neutral error message, users exhibited more signs of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The effects of affective interventions in human–computer interaction|url = http://iwc.oxfordjournals.org/content/16/2/295|journal = Interacting with Computers|date = 2004-04-01|issn = 0953-5438|pages = 295–309|volume = 16|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.intcom.2003.12.001|language = en|first = Timo|last = Partala|first2 = Veikko|last2 = Surakka}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PCaaS''' or, ''Personal Computer as a Service'', is a Personal Computer hardware and optionally software leasing, licensing and delivery model in which personal computer and optionally software (particularly installed on the PC) are leased and licensed on a [[subscription business model|subscription basis]]. The subscription often includes services such as staging, imaging, maintenance, fix, logistics services and may also be bundled with helpdesk services, data [[backup]] and recovery.

There are several vendors that have PCaaS offerings including, [http://www.bizbang.biz Bizbang], [https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/pc-as-a-service-for-business/cp/pcaas Dell], [http://www8.hp.com/us/en/services/daas.html HP] (they call theirs Device as a Service), and [http://www.thinkfwd.com.au/documents/PCaaS_From_Lenovo.pdf Lenovo] (in Australia only for now).

'''Computer addiction''' can be described as the excessive or compulsive use of the [[computer]] which persists despite serious negative consequences for personal, social, or occupational function.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another clear conceptualization is made by Block, who stated that "Conceptually, the diagnosis is a compulsive-impulsive spectrum disorder that involves online and/or offline computer usage and consists of at least three subtypes: excessive gaming, sexual preoccupations, and e-mail/text messaging".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Block|first=J. J.|title=Issues for DSM-V: Internet Addiction|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|date=1 March 2008|volume=165|issue=3|pages=306–7|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.07101556|pmid=18316427}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it was expected that this new type of [[addiction]] would find a place under the compulsive disorders in the [[DSM-5]], the current edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'', it is still counted as an unofficial disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Răşcanu|first=Ruxandra|author2=Marineanu, Corina|author3=Marineanu, Vasile|author4=Sumedrea, Cristian Mihai|author5=Chitu, Alexandru|title=Teenagers and their Addiction to Computer|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|date=May 2013|volume=78|pages=225–229|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.04.284}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of computer addiction is broadly divided into two types, namely '''offline computer addiction''' and '''online computer addiction'''. The term offline computer addiction is normally used when speaking about excessive gaming behavior, which can be practiced both offline and online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lemmens|first=Jeroen S.|author2=Valkenburg, Patti M. |author3=Peter, Jochen |title=Development and Validation of a Game Addiction Scale for Adolescents|journal=Media Psychology|date=26 February 2009|volume=12|issue=1|pages=77–95|doi=10.1080/15213260802669458}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online computer addiction, also known as [[Internet addiction]], gets more attention in general from scientific research than offline computer addiction, mainly because most cases of computer addiction are related to the excessive use of the Internet.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pies|first=R|title=Should DSM-V Designate "Internet Addiction" a Mental Disorder?|journal=Psychiatry|volume=6|issue=2|pages=31–37|pmid=19724746|pmc=2719452|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although addiction is usually used to describe dependence on substances, addiction can also be used to describe pathological Internet use. Experts on Internet addiction have described this syndrome as an individual being intensely working on the Internet, prolonged use of the Internet, uncontrollable use of the Internet, unable to use the Internet with efficient time, not being interested in the outside world, not spending time with people from the outside world, and an increase in their loneliness and dejection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yellowlees|first=Peter|author2=Marks|title=Problematic Internet use or Internet addiction?|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=May 2007|volume=23|issue=3|pages=1447–1453|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563205000439|accessdate=13 February 2014|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2005.05.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, simply working long hours on the computer does not necessarily mean someone is addicted.&lt;ref name="ADDICTIONS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Computer Addiction|url=http://www.addictions.com/computer/|publisher=ADDICTIONS.COM|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
*Being drawn by the computer as soon as one wakes up and before one goes to bed. 
*Replacing old hobbies with excessive use of the computer and using the computer as one's primary source of entertainment and procrastination
*Lacking physical exercise and/or outdoor exposure because of constant use of the computer, which could contribute to many health problems such as [[obesity]]

==Effects==
Excessive computer use may result in, or occur with:

* Lack of face to face social interaction
* [[Computer vision syndrome]]

==Causes==
[[Kimberly Young]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/cpb.1998.1.25 |title=The Relationship Between Depression and Internet Addiction |journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior |volume=1 |pages=25 |year=1998 |last1=Young |first1=Kimberly S. |last2=Rogers |first2=Robert C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that previous research links internet/computer addiction with existing mental health issues, most notably depression. She states that computer addiction has significant effects socially such as low self-esteem, psychologically and occupationally which led many subjects to academic failure.

According to a Korean study on internet/computer addiction, pathological use of the internet results in negative life impacts such as job loss, marriage breakdown, financial debt, and academic failure. 70% of internet users in Korea are reported to play online games, 18% of which are diagnosed as game addicts which relates to internet/computer addiction. The authors of the article conducted a study using Kimberly Young's questionnaire. The study showed that the majority of those who met the requirements of internet/computer addiction  suffered from interpersonal difficulties and stress and that those addicted to online games specifically responded that they hoped to avoid reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/109493103321640338 |title=Internet Over-Users' Psychological Profiles: A Behavior Sampling Analysis on Internet Addiction |journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=143 |year=2003 |last1=Whang |first1=Leo Sang-Min |last2=Lee |first2=Sujin |last3=Chang |first3=Geunyoung }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Computers nowadays rely almost entirely on the internet and thus relevant research articles relating to internet addiction may also be relevant to computer addiction.

== Diagnostic Test==
Many studies and surveys are being conducted to measure the extent of this type of addiction. Kimberly Young has created a questionnaire based on other disorders to assess the level of addiction. It is called the Internet Addict Diagnostic Questionnaire or IADQ. The questionnaire asks users about their online usage habits as well as their feelings about their internet usage. According to the IADQ sample, Internet Addiction resembles that of a Gambling disorder. Answering positively to five out of the eight questions on the IADQ may be indicative of an online addiction. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Young |first1=Kimberly |title=Internet Addiction Test (IAT) Sample |url=https://www.stoeltingco.com/media/wysiwyg/IAT_web_sample.pdf |publisher=Stoelting |accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term and history==

Observations about the addictiveness of computers and more specifically computer games date back at least to the mid 1970s.  Addiction and addictive behavior was common among the users of the [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO]] system at the [[University of Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Dear, Chapter 21 -- Coming of Age, [https://books.google.com/books?id=D5ZBDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA382 The Friendly Orange Glow], Pantheon Books, New York, 2017; see pages 381-387 for a discussion of addiction on PLATO, page 382 quotes a 1975 article from [[The Daily Illini]] that discusses the subject.&lt;/ref&gt; British [[Electronic learning|e-learning]] academic [[Nicholas Rushby]] suggested in his 1979 book, ''An Introduction to Educational Computing'', that people can be addicted to computers and suffer [[withdrawal symptoms]]. The term was also used by M. Shotton in 1989 in her book ''Computer Addiction''. However, Shotton concludes that the 'addicts' are not truly addicted. Dependency on computers, she argues, is better understood as a challenging and exiting pastime that can also lead to a professional career in the field. Computers do not turn gregarious, extroverted people into recluses; instead they offer introverts a source of inspiration, excitement and intellectual stimulation. Shotton's work seriously questions the legitimacy of the claim that computers cause addiction.

The term became more widespread with the explosive growth of the Internet, as well the availability of the [[personal computer]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pratarelli|first=Marc E.|author2=Browne, Blaine L.|author3=Johnson, Kimberly|title=The bits and bytes of computer/internet addiction: A factor analytic approach|journal=Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, and Computers|date=June 1999|volume=31|issue=2|pages=305–314|doi=10.3758/BF03207725}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computers and the Internet both started to take shape as a personal and comfortable medium which could be used by anyone who wanted to make use of it. With that explosive growth of individuals making use of PCs and the Internet, the question started to arise whether or not misuse or excessive use of these new technologies could be possible as well. It was hypothesized that, like any technology aimed specifically at human consumption and use, that abuse could have severe consequences for the individual in the short term and for the society in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Robert H. Anderson, Center for Information Revolution Analyses|title=Universal access to e-mail : feasibility and societal implications|year=1995|publisher=Rand|location=Santa Monica, Calif.|isbn=9780833023315}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late nineties people who made use of PCs and the internet where already referred to the term webaholics or cyberholics. Pratarelli et al. suggested at that point already to label "a cluster of behaviors potentially causing problems" as computer or Internet addiction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
&lt;!-- (The syntax of this paragraph makes absolutely no sense. Can someone clarify all of this?) Computer addiction was used as an effective defence by one of the defendants in the Eight Legged Groove Machine hacking trial in the 1993. The victims allegedly caused £120,00 worth of damage to JANET, BT, Financial Times, European Commission sites. Expert psychiatric evidence of obsessive addiction to hacking. Held - defendant was "addicted to hacking", and lacked criminal intent. Defendant acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269279414_TWELFTH_INTERNATIONAL_SYMPOSIUM_on_ECONOMIC_CRIME_Computer_Crime_in_the_1990s_-_A_Barrister's_View__Alistair_Kelman_Computer_Crime_in_the_1990s_A_Barrister's_View|work = TWELFTH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM on ECONOMIC CRIME |title=Computer Crime in the 1990s - A Barrister's View |last = Kelman|first = Alistair|date = 1994|journal = |accessdate = 16 December 2014|doi = 10.13140/2.1.3497.1201|pmid = |authorlink = }}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

There are other examples of computer overuse that date back to the earliest [[computer games]]. Press reports have furthermore noted that some [[Finnish Defence Forces]] [[conscription|conscripts]] were not mature enough to meet the demands of military life, and were required to interrupt or postpone military service for a year. One reported source of the lack of needed social skills is overuse of computer games or the Internet. [[Forbes]] termed this overuse "Web fixations", and stated that they were responsible for 12 such interruptions or deferrals over the 5 years from 2000–2005.{{dead link|date=June 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Dusty-dirty_PC.jpg|thumb|Dusty-dirty PC]]

'''Computer maintenance''' is the practice of keeping computers in a good state of repair.  A computer containing accumulated dust and debris may not run properly.

Dust and debris will accumulate as a result of air cooling. Any filters used to mitigate this need regular service and changes.  If the cooling system is not filtered then regular computer cleaning may prevent short circuits and overheating.

==Components==
===Keyboard===
The crumbs, dust, and other particulate that fall between the keys and build up underneath are loosened by spraying pressurized air into the keyboard, then removed with a low-pressure vacuum cleaner. A plastic-cleaning agent applied to the surface of the keys with a cloth is used to remove the accumulation of oil and dirt from repeated contact with a user's fingertips. If this is not sufficient for a more severely dirty keyboard, keys are physically removed for more focused individual cleaning, or for better access to the area beneath. Finally, the surface is wiped with a disinfectant.

===Monitor===
	A monitor displays information in visual form, using text and graphics. The portion of the monitor that displays the information is called the screen. Like a television screen, a computer screen can show still or moving pictures and It’s a part of Output Devices.
		There are two basic types of monitors: CRT (cathode ray tube) monitors and LCD (liquid crystal display) monitors. Both types produce sharp images, but LCD monitors have the advantage of being much thinner and lighter. CRT monitors, however, are generally more affordable.

Fingerprints, water spots, and dust are removed from the screen with a cleaning wipe specialized for the screen type (CRT, LCD, etc.). A general plastic-cleaning agent is used on the outer casing, which requires a less gentle cleanser but may need more focused attention to unusual buildups of dust, grime, pen marks, etc. idiosyncratic to the user and environment.

===Mouse===
The top surface of the mouse is wiped with a plastic cleanser to remove the dirt that accumulates from contact with the hand, as on the keyboard. The bottom surface is also cleaned to ensure that it can slide freely. If it is a [[Computer mouse#Mechanical mice|mechanical mouse]], the trackball is taken out, not only to clean the ball itself, but to scrape dirt from the runners that sense the ball's movement and can become jittery or stuck if impeded by grime.

===Tower/desktop unit===
Internal components accumulate dust brought in by the airflow maintained by fans to keep the PC from overheating. A soft brush may remove loose dirt; the remainder is dislodged with compressed air and removed with a low-pressure vacuum. The case is wiped down with a cleaning agent. A pressurized blower or [[gas duster]] can remove dust that cannot be reached with a brush.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Acosta|first1=Jeremy|title=Basic Computer Maintenance|url=http://gamesngearselite.com/computer-basic-maintenance/|website=Games and Gears}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data ==

===Backups===
''{{Main article|Backup}}''

Important data stored on computers may be copied and archived securely so that, in the event of failure, the data and systems may be reconstructed.  When major maintenance such as [[Patch (computing)|patching]] is performed, a backup is recommended as the first step in case the update fails and [[Reversion (software development)|reversion]] is required.

[[Disk cleanup]] may be performed as regular maintenance to remove these.  Files may become fragmented and so slow the performance of the computer.  ''[[Disk defragmentation]]'' may be performed to combine these fragments and so improve performance.

===Legal issues===
In the U.S.A, the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] specifically exempts computer-maintenance activities, so copies of copyright files may be made in the course of maintenance provided that they are destroyed afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation |title=Internet and online law |author=Kent D. Stuckey |year=1996 |pages=6–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Software ==

===Operating system===
[[Operating system|Operating-system]] files such as the [[Windows registry]] may require maintenance.  A utility such as a [[registry cleaner]] may be used for this. Also inbuilt Disk defragmenter will also help.

===Software updates===
Software packages and operating systems may require regular updates to correct [[software bug]]s and to address security weaknesses.

==Security==
{{Main article|Computer security}}
Maintaining security involves [[vulnerability management]] and installation and proper operation of [[Antivirus software|antivirus softwares]] like [[Kaspersky Anti-Virus|Kaspersky]], [[Avast Antivirus]], [[McAfee]] and Many are available.

[[Image:Lehmer sieve.jpg|thumb|The [[Lehmer sieve]] is an example of a digital non-electronic computer, specialized for  finding [[Prime number|primes]] and solving simple [[Diophantine equations]]. When digital electronic computers appeared, they displaced all other kinds of computers, including [[analog computer]]s and [[mechanical computer]]s]]

In [[computer science]], a '''digital electronic computer''' is a [[computer]] machine which is both an [[electronic computer]] and a [[digital computer]]. Examples of a digital electronic computers include the [[IBM PC]], the [[Apple Macintosh]] as well as modern [[smartphone]]s. When computers that were both [[digital computer|digital]] and electronic appeared, they displaced almost all other kinds of computers, but [[computation]] has historically been performed in various non-digital and non-electronic ways: the [[Lehmer sieve]] is an example of a digital non-electronic computer, while [[analog computer]]s are examples of non-digital computers which can be electronic (with [[analog electronics]]), and [[mechanical computer]]s are examples of non-electronic computers (which may be digital or not). An example of a computer which is both non-digital and non-electronic is the ancient [[Antikythera mechanism]] found in [[Greece]]. All kinds of computers, whether they are digital or analog, and electronic or non-electronic, can be [[Turing complete]] if they have sufficient [[computer memory|memory]]. A digital electronic computer is not necessarily a [[programmable computer]], a [[stored program computer]], or a [[general purpose computer]], since in essence a digital electronic computer can be built for one specific application and be non-reprogrammable. As of 2014, most [[personal computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s in people's homes that use [[multicore]] [[central processing unit]]s (such as [[AMD FX]], [[Intel Core i7]], or the multicore varieties of [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-based chips) are also [[parallel computer]]s using the [[MIMD]] (multiple instructions - multiple data) paradigm, a technology previously only used in digital electronic [[supercomputer]]s. As of 2014, most digital electronic supercomputers are also [[cluster computer]]s, a technology that can be used at home in the form of small [[Beowulf cluster]]s. Parallel computation is also possible with non-digital or non-electronic computers. An example of a parallel computation system using the [[abacus]] would be a group of [[human computer]]s using a number of abacus machines for computation and communicating using [[natural language]].

A digital computer can perform its operations in the [[decimal]] system, in [[binary number|binary]], in [[ternary numeral system|ternary]] or in other [[numeral system]]s. As of 2014, all digital electronic computers commonly used, whether [[personal computer]]s or [[supercomputer]]s, are working in the binary number system and also use [[Boolean logic|binary logic]]. A few [[ternary computer]]s using [[ternary logic]] were built mainly in the [[Soviet Union]] as research projects.

A digital electronic computer is not necessarily a [[transistorized computer]]: before the advent of the [[transistor]], computers used [[vacuum tube]]s. The transistor enabled electronic computers to become much more powerful, and recent and future developments in [[digital electronics]] may enable humanity to build even more powerful electronic computers. One such possible development is the [[memristor]].

People living in the beginning of the 21st century use digital electronic computers for [[computer storage|storing]] [[data]], such as [[photograph|photo]]s, [[music]], [[document]]s, and for performing complex mathematical computations or for communication, commonly over a worldwide [[computer network]] called the [[internet]] which connects many of the world's computers.  All these activities made possible by digital electronic computers could, in essence, be performed with non-digital or non-electronic computers if they were sufficiently powerful, but it was only the combination of electronics technology with digital computation in binary that enabled humanity to reach the computation power necessary for today's computing. Advances in [[quantum computing]], [[DNA computing]], [[optical computing]] or other technologies could lead to the development of more powerful computers in the future.

Digital computers are inherently best described by [[discrete mathematics]], while analog computers are most commonly associated with [[continuous mathematics]].

The philosophy of [[digital physics]] views the [[universe]] as being digital. [[Konrad Zuse]] wrote a book known as ''[[Rechnender Raum]]'' in which he described the whole universe as one all-encompassing computer.

The WDR paper computer or Know-How computer  was a "computer" that could be easily assembled from a sheet of paper and individual matches. This would allow anyone interested to learn how to program without having an electronic computer at their disposal. Thus, this "computer" served as an educational aid in the field of computer science. The know-how computer was developed by Wolfgang Back and Ulrich Rohde and first presented in the television program [[WDR Computerclub]] in 1983.

He was also published in [[Germany|German]] magazines [[MC (magazine)|MC]] and {{ill|PC Magazin|de}}.

The "computer" worked on paper; Matches were used as information units. Only five commands were enough to represent all mathematical functions. This exercise computer on paper was sent in over 400,000 copies and belonged at that time to the computers with the widest circulation. An implementation as a computer program is available on Wolfgang Back's website.

The method of operation is based on [[register machine]], but is more to the approach of Shepherdson and Sturgis.

A derived version of the "Paper Computer" is used as a "know how computer" in [[Namibia|Namibian]] school education.

WATIAC, and the WATMAP assembly language that ran on it were developed in 1973 by the newly founded [[Computer Systems Group]],
at the [[University of Waterloo]], under the direction of [[Wes Graham]].

In the 1970s most programming was conducted through [[batch stream processing]], where the operating systems of the day, like [[IBM]]`s [[OS-360]], would allow a single program to use all the resources of a large computer, for a limited period of time.&lt;ref name=ParentsOfInvention&gt;

| quote       = During the 1970s, the University of Waterloo, located in southern Ontario, Canada, was almost as synonymous with computing as MIT or Berkeley.  It had developed extensions to the popular general-purpose Fortran programming language called WATFOR and WATFIV and its own version of the equally popular business computing language COBOL, called WATBOL.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Since student programs were only run a few times, possibly only once, after they had been successfully written, and debugged, efficient running of those programs was of relatively little importance, compared with quick compilation and relatively good error messages.

Waterloo had been a leader in writing single pass, compile-and-go teaching compilers, with first its [[WATFOR]] [[FORTRAN]] compiler, and its [[WATBOL]] [[COBOL]] compiler.&lt;ref name=WatiacWatmap/&gt;&lt;ref name=WatiacArchitecture/&gt;
WATMAP was developed to be a similar compile-and-go teaching compiler.

'''Computer programming''' is the process of designing and building an [[executable]] [[computer program]] for accomplishing a specific [[computing]] task. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating [[algorithm]]s, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen [[programming language]] (commonly referred to as '''coding'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yearofcodes.tumblr.com/what-is-coding|title=What is coding|author=Shaun Bebbington|year=2014|accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yearofcodes.tumblr.com/what-is-programming|title=What is programming|author=Shaun Bebbington|year=2014|accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The [[source code]] of a program is written in one or more programming languages. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task for solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the [[Domain (software engineering)|application domain]], specialized algorithms, and formal [[logic]].

Related programming tasks include [[Software testing|testing]], [[debugging]], maintaining a program's [[source code]], implementation of [[Build automation|build systems]], and management of derived artifacts such as [[machine code]] of computer programs. These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term ''[[software development]]'' is used for this larger process with the term ''programming'', ''implementation'', or ''coding'' reserved for the actual writing of source code. [[Software engineering]] combines [[engineering]] techniques with software development practices.

==History==
[[File:Ada lovelace.jpg|thumb|[[Ada Lovelace]], whose notes added to the end of [[Luigi Menabrea]]'s paper included the first [[algorithm]] designed for processing by an [[Analytical Engine]]. She is often recognized as history's first computer programmer.]]
{{See also|History of programming languages}}

Programmable devices have existed at least as far back as 1206 AD, when the [[automata]] of [[Al-Jazari]] were programmable, via pegs and [[cam]]s, to play various rhythms and drum patterns;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Museum of Music: A History of Mechanical Instruments|first=Charles B.|last=Fowler|journal=Music Educators Journal|volume=54|issue=2|date=October 1967|pages=45–49|doi=10.2307/3391092|jstor=3391092|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1801 [[Jacquard loom]] could produce entirely different weaves by changing the "program" - a series of [[Card stock|pasteboard]] cards with holes punched in them.

However, the first computer program is generally dated to 1843, when mathematician [[Ada Lovelace]] published an [[algorithm]] to calculate a sequence of [[Bernoulli numbers]], intended to be carried out by [[Charles Babbage]]'s [[Analytical Engine]].&lt;ref name="IEEE"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fuegi | first1 = J. | last2 = Francis | first2 = J. | title = Lovelace &amp; Babbage and the Creation of the 1843 'notes' | journal = IEEE Annals of the History of Computing | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 16 | year = 2003 | doi = 10.1109/MAHC.2003.1253887}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women would continue to dominate the field of computer programming until the mid 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/life-and-relationships/women-were-the-first-computer-programmers-then-men-crowded-them-out-20170822-gy1e8r.html|title=Women were the first computer programmers, then men crowded them out|last=Mihm|first=Stephen|date=2017-08-23|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PunchCardDecks.agr.jpg|thumb|Data and instructions were once stored on external [[punched card]]s, which were kept in order and arranged in program decks.]]
In the 1880s [[Herman Hollerith]] invented the concept of storing ''data'' in machine-readable form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/hollerith.html |title=Columbia University Computing History - Herman Hollerith |publisher=Columbia.edu |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later a [[plugboard|control panel]] (plugboard) added to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for different jobs, and by the late 1940s, [[unit record equipment]] such as the [[IBM 602]] and [[IBM 604]], were programmed by control panels in a similar way; as were the first [[electronic computer]]s. However, with the concept of the [[stored-program computer]]s introduced in 1949, both programs and data were stored and manipulated in the same way in [[computer memory]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

[[Machine code]] was the language of early programs, written in the [[instruction set]] of the particular machine, often in [[binary numeral system|binary]] notation. [[Assembly language]]s were soon developed that let the programmer specify instruction in a text format, (e.g., ADD X, TOTAL), with abbreviations for each operation code and meaningful names for specifying addresses. However, because an assembly language is little more than a different notation for a machine language, any two machines with [[Comparison of instruction set architectures|different instruction sets]] also have different assembly languages. [[Kathleen Booth]] created one of the first Assembly languages in 1950 for various computers at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/eile/brainstorm/2018/0110/932241-the-women-who-led-the-way-in-computer-programming/|title=The women who led the way in computer programming|last=Connolly|first=Cornelia|date=2018-01-10|work=RTE.ie|access-date=2018-11-26|last2=Hall|first2=Tony|language=en|last3=Lenaghan|first3=Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:IBM402plugboard.Shrigley.wireside.jpg|thumb|Wired control panel for an [[IBM 402 Accounting Machine]].]]
[[High-level language]]s allow the programmer to write programs in terms that are syntactically richer, and more capable of [[abstraction (computer science)|abstracting]] the code, making it targetable to varying machine instruction sets via compilation declarations and heuristics. The first [[compiler]] for a programming language was developed by [[Grace Hopper]].{{Sfn|Smith|2013|p=6}} When Hopper went to work on [[UNIVAC]] in 1949, she brought the idea of using compilers with her.{{Sfn|Ceruzzi|1998|p=84-85}}{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=176}} Compilers harness the power of computers to make programming easier&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17704662/|title=Fortran creator John Backus dies|work=msnbc.com|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; by allowing programmers to specify calculations by entering a formula using [[infix notation]] (e.g., {{nowrap|Y &amp;#0061; X*2 + 5*X + 9}}) for example. [[FORTRAN]], the first widely used high-level language to have a functional implementation which permitted the abstraction of reusable blocks of code, came out in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17704662/ |title=Fortran creator John Backus dies - Tech and gadgets- msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2007-03-20 |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951 [[Betty Holberton|Frances E. Holberton]] developed the first [[Sort Merge Generator|sort-merge generator]] which ran on the [[UNIVAC I]].{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=177}} Another woman working at UNIVAC, [[Milly Koss|Adele Mildred Koss]], developed a program that was a precursor to [[report generator]]s.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=177}} In Russia, [[Kateryna Yushchenko (scientist)|Kateryna Yushchenko]] developed the [[Address programming language]] for the [[MESM]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arnnet.com.au/slideshow/574529/pictures-9-programming-languages-women-who-created-them/|title=In Pictures: 9 programming languages and the women who created them|last=Johnson|first=Phil|date=|website=ARN|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea for the creation of COBOL started in 1959 when [[Mary K. Hawes]], who worked for [[Burroughs Corporation|Burroughs Corporation]], set up a meeting to discuss creating a common business language.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=179}} She invited six people, including Grace Hopper.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=179}} Hopper was involved in developing COBOL as a business language and creating "self-documenting" programming.{{Sfn|Smith|2013|p=7}}{{Sfn|Ceruzzi|1998|p=92}} Hopper's contribution to COBOL was based on her programming language, called [[FLOW-MATIC]].{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=176}}  In 1961, [[Jean E. Sammet]] developed [[FORMAC]] and also published ''Programming Languages: History and Fundamentals'' which went on to be a standard work on programming languages.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=179}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24510360/|title=Computer Authority to Speak Here|last=|first=|date=April 9, 1972|work=The Times|access-date=October 13, 2018|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Programs were mostly still entered using punched cards or [[paper tape]]. See [[computer programming in the punch card era]]. By the late 1960s, [[data storage device]]s and [[computer terminal]]s became inexpensive enough that programs could be created by typing directly into the computers. Frances Holberton created a code to allow keyboard inputs while she worked at UNIVAC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24508073|title=Frances Holberton, Pioneer in Computer Languages, Dies|last=|first=|date=December 12, 2001|work=The Courier-Journal|access-date=October 13, 2018|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Text editor]]s were developed that allowed changes and corrections to be made much more easily than with punched cards.

==Modern programming==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2010}}

===Quality requirements===
{{software development process}}

Whatever the approach to development may be, the final program must satisfy some fundamental properties. The following properties are among the most important:
*[[Reliability engineering#Software reliability|Reliability]]: how often the results of a program are correct. This depends on conceptual correctness of algorithms, and minimization of programming mistakes, such as mistakes in resource management (e.g., [[buffer overflow]]s and [[race condition]]s) and logic errors (such as division by zero or [[off-by-one error]]s).
*[[Robustness (computer science)|Robustness]]: how well a program anticipates problems due to errors (not bugs). This includes situations such as incorrect, inappropriate or corrupt data, unavailability of needed resources such as memory, operating system services and network connections, user error, and unexpected power outages.
*[[Usability]]: the [[ergonomics]] of a program: the ease with which a person can use the program for its intended purpose or in some cases even unanticipated purposes. Such issues can make or break its success even regardless of other issues. This involves a wide range of textual, graphical and sometimes hardware elements that improve the clarity, intuitiveness, cohesiveness and completeness of a program's user interface.
*[[Software portability|Portability]]: the range of [[computer hardware]] and [[operating system]] platforms on which the source code of a program can be [[compiled]]/[[interpreter (computing)|interpreted]] and run. This depends on differences in the programming facilities provided by the different platforms, including hardware and operating system resources, expected behavior of the hardware and operating system, and availability of platform specific compilers (and sometimes libraries) for the language of the source code.
*[[Maintainability]]: the ease with which a program can be modified by its present or future developers in order to make improvements or customizations, fix [[Software bug|bugs]] and [[Vulnerability (computing)|security holes]], or adapt it to new environments. Good practices&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wisdomgeek.com/programming/tips-become-good-programmer/|title=Programming 101: Tips to become a good programmer - Wisdom Geek|date=2016-05-19|website=Wisdom Geek|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; during initial development make the difference in this regard. This quality may not be directly apparent to the end user but it can significantly affect the fate of a program over the long term.
*[[Algorithmic efficiency|Efficiency]]/[[performance engineering|performance]]: Measure of system resources a program consumes (processor time, memory space, slow devices such as disks, network bandwidth and to some extent even user interaction): the less, the better. This also includes careful management of resources, for example cleaning up [[temporary file]]s and eliminating [[memory leak]]s.

===Readability of source code===
In computer programming, [[readability]] refers to the ease with which a human reader can comprehend the purpose, [[control flow]], and operation of source code. It affects the aspects of quality above, including portability, usability and most importantly maintainability.

Readability is important because programmers spend the majority of their time reading, trying to understand and modifying existing source code, rather than writing new source code. Unreadable code often leads to bugs, inefficiencies, and [[Code duplication|duplicated code]]. A study&lt;ref&gt;James L. Elshoff, Michael Marcotty, [http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/358589.358596 Improving computer program readability to aid modification], Communications of the ACM, v.25 n.8, p.512-521, Aug 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; found that a few simple readability transformations made code shorter and drastically reduced the time to understand it.

Following a consistent [[programming style]] often helps readability. However, readability is more than just programming style. Many factors, having little or nothing to do with the ability of the computer to efficiently compile and execute the code, contribute to readability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://docforge.com/wiki/Readability | title=Readability | author=Multiple (wiki) | work=Docforge | accessdate=2010-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these factors include:
*Different [[indent style]]s (whitespace)
*[[Comment (computer programming)|Comments]]
*[[decomposition (computer science)|Decomposition]]
*[[Naming conventions (programming)|Naming conventions]] for objects (such as variables, classes, procedures, etc.)

The [[separation of presentation and content|presentation]] aspects of this (such as indents, line breaks, color highlighting, and so on) are often handled by the [[source code editor]], but the content aspects reflect the programmer's talent and skills.

Various [[visual programming language]]s have also been developed with the intent to resolve readability concerns by adopting non-traditional approaches to code structure and display. [[Integrated development environment]]s (IDEs) aim to integrate all such help. Techniques like [[Code refactoring]] can enhance readability.

===Algorithmic complexity===
The academic field and the engineering practice of computer programming are both largely concerned with discovering and implementing the most efficient algorithms for a given class of problem. For this purpose, algorithms are classified into ''orders'' using so-called [[Big O notation]], which expresses resource use, such as execution time or memory consumption, in terms of the size of an input. Expert programmers are familiar with a variety of well-established algorithms and their respective complexities and use this knowledge to choose algorithms that are best suited to the circumstances.

====Chess algorithms as an example====
"Programming a Computer for Playing Chess" was a 1950 paper that evaluated a "minimax" [[algorithm]] that is part of the history of algorithmic complexity; a course on IBM's [[Deep Blue (chess computer)]] is part of the computer science curriculum at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=CS221 |url=http://stanford.edu/~cpiech/cs221/apps/deepBlue.html
|quote=In 1950, Claude Shannon published ... "Programming a Computer for Playing Chess", ... "minimax" algorithm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodologies===
The first step in most formal software development processes is requirements analysis, followed by testing to determine value modeling, implementation, and failure elimination (debugging). There exist a lot of differing approaches for each of those tasks. One approach popular for [[requirements analysis]] is [[Use Case]] analysis. Many programmers use forms of [[Agile software development]] where the various stages of formal software development are more integrated together into short cycles that take a few weeks rather than years. There are many approaches to the Software development process.

Popular modeling techniques include Object-Oriented Analysis and Design ([[OOAD]]) and Model-Driven Architecture ([[Model-Driven Architecture|MDA]]). The Unified Modeling Language ([[Unified Modeling Language|UML]]) is a notation used for both the OOAD and MDA.

A similar technique used for database design is Entity-Relationship Modeling ([[Entity-Relationship Model|ER Modeling]]).

Implementation techniques include imperative languages ([[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] or [[procedural programming|procedural]]), [[functional programming|functional languages]], and [[logic programming|logic languages]].

===Measuring language usage===
{{Main|Measuring programming language popularity}}
It is very difficult to determine what are the most popular of modern programming languages. Methods of measuring programming language popularity include: counting the number of job advertisements that mention the language,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2007/09/11/226631/sslcomputer-weekly-it-salary-survey-finance-boom-drives-it-job.htm Survey of Job advertisements mentioning a given language]&lt;/ref&gt; the number of books sold and courses teaching the language (this overestimates the importance of newer languages), and estimates of the number of existing lines of code written in the language (this underestimates the number of users of business languages such as COBOL).

Some languages are very popular for particular kinds of applications, while some languages are regularly used to write many different kinds of applications. For example, [[COBOL]] is still strong in corporate data centers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mitchell|first1=Robert|title=The Cobol Brain Drain|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2504568/data-center/the-cobol-brain-drain.html|publisher=Computer World|accessdate=9 May 2015|date=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; often on large [[mainframe computer]]s, [[Fortran]] in engineering applications, [[scripting language]]s in [[World Wide Web|Web]] development, and [[C (programming language)|C]] in [[embedded software]]. Many applications use a mix of several languages in their construction and use.  New languages are generally designed around the syntax of a prior language with new functionality added, (for example [[C++]] adds object-orientation to C, and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] adds memory management and [[bytecode]] to C++, but as a result, loses efficiency and the ability for low-level manipulation).

===Debugging===
[[File:H96566k.jpg|thumb|The [[Software bug|bug]] from 1947 which is at the origin of a popular (but incorrect) etymology for the common term for a software defect.]]
{{main|Debugging}}
Debugging is a very important task in the software development process since having defects in a program can have significant consequences for its users. Some languages are more prone to some kinds of faults because their specification does not require compilers to perform as much checking as other languages. Use of a [[static code analysis]] tool can help detect some possible problems. Normally the first step in debugging is to attempt to reproduce the problem. This can be a non-trivial task, for example as with parallel processes or some unusual software bugs. Also, specific user environment and usage history can make it difficult to reproduce the problem.

After the bug is reproduced, the input of the program may need to be simplified to make it easier to debug. For example, a bug in a compiler can make it crash when parsing some large source file. However, after simplification of the test case, only few lines from the original source file can be sufficient to reproduce the same crash. Such simplification can be done manually, using a divide-and-conquer approach. The programmer will try to remove some parts of original test case and check if the problem still exists. When debugging the problem in a GUI, the programmer can try to skip some user interaction from the original problem description and check if remaining actions are sufficient for bugs to appear.

Debugging is often done with [[Integrated development environment|IDE]]s like [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]], [[Visual Studio]], [[Xcode]], [[Kdevelop]], [[NetBeans]] and [[Code::Blocks]]. Standalone debuggers like [[GDB]] are also used, and these often provide less of a visual environment, usually using a [[command line]]. Some text editors such as [[Emacs]] allow GDB to be invoked through them, to provide a visual environment.

==Programming languages==
{{Main|Programming language|List of programming languages}}

Different programming languages support different styles of programming (called ''[[programming paradigm]]s''). The choice of language used is subject to many considerations, such as company policy, suitability to task, availability of third-party packages, or individual preference. Ideally, the programming language best suited for the task at hand will be selected. Trade-offs from this ideal involve finding enough programmers who know the language to build a team, the availability of compilers for that language, and the efficiency with which programs written in a given language execute. Languages form an approximate spectrum from "low-level" to "high-level"; "low-level" languages are typically more machine-oriented and faster to execute, whereas "high-level" languages are more abstract and easier to use but execute less quickly. It is usually easier to code in "high-level" languages than in "low-level" ones.

[[Allen Downey]], in his book ''How To Think Like A Computer Scientist'', writes:

:The details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just about every language:
:*Input: Gather data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device.
:*Output: Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.
:*Arithmetic: Perform basic arithmetical operations like addition and multiplication.
:*Conditional Execution: Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate sequence of statements.
:*Repetition: Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.

Many computer languages provide a mechanism to call functions provided by [[shared library|shared libraries]]. Provided the functions in a library follow the appropriate run-time conventions (e.g., method of passing [[argument (computer science)|arguments]]), then these functions may be written in any other language.

'''Information technology''' ('''IT''') is the use of [[computer]]s to store, retrieve, transmit, and manipulate [[data (computing)|data]],&lt;ref name="DOP"&gt;{{citation |contribution=IT |title=A Dictionary of Physics |editor-last=Daintith |editor-first=John |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t83.e1592 |access-date=1 August 2012|isbn=9780199233991 }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[information]], often in the context of a business or other enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://foldoc.org/information+technology|title=Free on-line dictionary of computing (FOLDOC)|access-date=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; IT is considered to be a subset of [[information and communications technology]] (ICT). An '''information technology system''' ('''IT system''') is generally an [[information system]], a [[communications system]] or, more specifically speaking, a [[computer system]] – including all [[Computer hardware|hardware]], [[software]] and [[peripheral]] equipment – operated by a limited group of users.

Humans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating, and communicating information since the [[Sumer]]ians in [[Mesopotamia]] developed [[cuneiform|writing]] in about 3000&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;{{citation |last=Butler |first=Jeremy G. |title=A History of Information Technology and Systems |url=http://www.tcf.ua.edu/AZ/ITHistoryOutline.htm |publisher=University of Arizona |access-date=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the term ''information technology'' in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]''; authors [[Harold Leavitt|Harold J. Leavitt]] and Thomas L. Whisler commented that "the new technology does not yet have a single established name. We shall call it information technology (IT)." Their definition consists of three categories: techniques for processing, the application of [[statistical]] and mathematical methods to [[decision-making]], and the simulation of higher-order thinking through computer programs.&lt;ref name="LeavittWhisler"&gt;{{citation |title=Management in the 1980s |url=http://hbr.org/1958/11/management-in-the-1980s |last1=Leavitt |first1=Harold J. |last2=Whisler |first2=Thomas L. |journal=Harvard Business Review |year=1958 |volume=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks, but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as [[television]] and telephones. Several products or services within an economy are associated with information technology, including [[computer hardware]], software, electronics, semiconductors, internet, [[telecommunications equipment|telecom equipment]], and [[e-commerce]].&lt;ref name="DMC"&gt;{{citation |last1=Chandler |first1=Daniel |last2=Munday |first2=Rod |contribution=Information technology |title=A Dictionary of Media and Communication |edition=first |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nLuJz-ZB828C&amp;pg=PA211 |quote = Commonly a synonym for computers and computer networks but more broadly designating any technology that is used to generate, store, process, and/or distribute information electronically, including television and telephone. |access-date=1 August 2012 |subscription=yes|isbn=978-0199568758 |date=2011-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|On the later more broad application of the term IT, Keary comments: "In its original application 'information technology' was appropriate to describe the convergence of technologies with application in the broad field of data storage, retrieval, processing, and dissemination. This useful conceptual term has since been converted to what purports to be concrete use, but without the reinforcement of definition&amp;nbsp;... the term IT lacks substance when applied to the name of any function, discipline, or position."{{sfnp|Ralston|Hemmendinger|Reilly|2000|p=869|ps=none}}}}

Based on the storage and processing technologies employed, it is possible to distinguish four distinct phases of IT development: pre-mechanical (3000&amp;nbsp;BC&amp;nbsp;– 1450&amp;nbsp;AD), mechanical (1450–1840), [[electromechanical]] (1840–1940), and electronic (1940–present).&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt; This article focuses on the most recent period (electronic), which began in about 1940.

{{main|History of computing hardware}}

[[Machine|Devices]] have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, probably initially in the form of a [[tally stick]].&lt;ref name="Schmandt-Besserat"&gt;{{citation |last=Schmandt-Besserat |first=Denise |title=Decipherment of the earliest tablets |journal=Science |year=1981 |volume=211 |issue=4479 |pages=283–85 |doi=10.1126/science.211.4479.283 |pmid=17748027 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Antikythera mechanism]], dating from about the beginning of the first century BC, is generally considered to be the earliest known mechanical [[analog computer]], and the earliest known geared mechanism.{{sfnp|Wright|2012|p=279|ps=none}} Comparable geared devices did not emerge in Europe until the 16th century, and it was not until 1645 that the first [[mechanical calculator]] capable of performing the four basic arithmetical operations was developed.{{sfnp|Chaudhuri|2004|p=3|ps=none}}

[[Electronic computers]], using either [[relay]]s or [[valve]]s, began to appear in the early 1940s. The [[electromechanical]] [[Z3 (computer)|Zuse Z3]], completed in 1941, was the world's first [[computer programming|programmable]] computer, and by modern standards one of the first machines that could be considered a complete [[computing]] machine. [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], developed during the Second World War to decrypt [[Nazi Germany|German]] messages, was the first [[electronics|electronic]] [[Digital data|digital]] computer. Although it was [[Computer programming|programmable]], it was not general-purpose, being designed to perform only a single task. It also lacked the ability to store its program in memory; programming was carried out using plugs and switches to alter the internal wiring.{{sfnp|Lavington|1980|p=11|ps=none}} The first recognisably modern electronic digital [[stored-program computer]] was the [[Manchester Baby]], which ran its first program on 21 June 1948.&lt;ref name="Enticknap"&gt;{{citation |last=Enticknap |first=Nicholas |title=Computing's Golden Jubilee |journal=Resurrection |issue=20 |date=Summer 1998 |url=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res20.htm#d |issn=0958-7403 |access-date=19 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of [[transistor]]s in the late 1940s at [[Bell Laboratories]] allowed a new generation of computers to be designed with greatly reduced power consumption. The first commercially available stored-program computer, the [[Ferranti Mark I]], contained 4050 valves and had a power consumption of 25 kilowatts. By comparison the first transistorised computer, developed at the University of Manchester and operational by November 1953, consumed only 150 watts in its final version.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |doi=10.1049/esej:19980301 |last=Cooke-Yarborough |first=E.

[[File:PaperTapes-5and8Hole.jpg|right|upright=1.35|thumb|[[Punched tape]]s were used in [[early computer]]s to represent [[data (computing)|data]].]]
{{main|Data storage device}}
Early electronic computers such as [[Colossus computer|Colossus]] made use of [[punched tape]], a long strip of paper on which data was represented by a series of holes, a technology now obsolete.{{sfnp|Alavudeen|Venkateshwaran|2010|p=178|ps=none}} Electronic data storage, which is used in modern computers, dates from World War II, when a form of [[delay line memory]] was developed to remove the clutter from [[radar]] signals, the first practical application of which was the mercury delay line.{{sfnp|Lavington|1998|p=1|ps=none}} The first [[random-access memory|random-access]] digital storage device was the [[Williams tube]], based on a standard [[cathode ray tube]],&lt;ref name="Resurrection"&gt;{{citation |title=Early computers at Manchester University |journal=Resurrection |volume=1 |issue=4 |date=Summer 1992 |url=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res04.htm#g |issn=0958-7403 |accessdate=19 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the information stored in it and delay line memory was volatile in that it had to be continuously refreshed, and thus was lost once power was removed. The earliest form of non-volatile computer storage was the [[drum memory|magnetic drum]], invented in 1932&lt;ref name="MagDrum"&gt;{{citation |url=http://cs-exhibitions.uni-klu.ac.at/index.php?id=222 |title=Magnetic drum |work=Virtual Exhibitions in Informatics |editor=Universität Klagenfurt |accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used in the [[Ferranti Mark 1]], the world's first commercially available general-purpose electronic computer.&lt;ref name="Digital60MM1"&gt;{{citation |title=The Manchester Mark 1 |url=http://www.digital60.org/birth/manchestercomputers/mark1/manchester.html |publisher=University of Manchester |accessdate=24 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121112547/http://www.digital60.org/birth/manchestercomputers/mark1/manchester.html |archivedate=21 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

IBM introduced the first [[hard disk drive]] in 1956, as a component of their [[IBM 305 RAMAC|305 RAMAC]] computer system.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Khurshudov |first=Andrei |title=The Essential Guide to Computer Data Storage: From Floppy to DVD |year=2001 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-130-92739-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}} Most digital data today is still stored magnetically on hard disks, or optically on media such as [[CD-ROM]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Wang |first1=Shan X. |last2=Taratorin |first2=Aleksandr Markovich |title=Magnetic Information Storage Technology |year=1999 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-734570-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4–5}} Until 2002 most information was stored on [[analog device]]s, but that year digital storage capacity exceeded analog for the first time. As of 2007 almost 94% of the data stored worldwide was held digitally:&lt;ref name="USCNews"&gt;{{citation |last=Wu |first=Suzanne |title=How Much Information Is There in the World? |url=http://news.usc.edu/#!/article/29360/How-Much-Information-Is-There-in-the-World |work=USC News |publisher=University of Southern California |accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 52% on hard disks, 28% on optical devices and 11% on digital magnetic tape. It has been estimated that the worldwide capacity to store information on electronic devices grew from less than 3 [[exabyte]]s in 1986 to 295 exabytes in 2007,&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"&gt;{{citation |last1=Hilbert |first1=Martin |last2=López |first2=Priscila |title=The World's Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information |date=1 April 2011 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=332 |issue=6025 |pages=60–65 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60.full?sid=ef08b031-c911-46ae-9e9c-d675cc635c6d |accessdate=10 September 2013 |doi=10.1126/science.1200970 |pmid=21310967}}&lt;/ref&gt; doubling roughly every 3 years.&lt;ref name="Hilbertvideo2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ideas.economist.com/video/giant-sifting-sound-0|title=Americas events- Video animation on The World's Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information from 1986 to 2010|work=The Economist|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118072720/http://ideas.economist.com/video/giant-sifting-sound-0|archivedate=18 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Databases====
{{main|Database}}

Database management systems emerged in the 1960s to address the problem of storing and retrieving large amounts of data accurately and quickly. One of the earliest such systems was [[IBM]]'s [[IBM Information Management System|Information Management System]] (IMS),{{sfnp|Ward|Dafoulas|2006|p=2|ps=none}} which is still widely deployed more than 50 years later.&lt;ref name="IMS"&gt;{{citation |last=Olofson |first=Carl W. |title=A Platform for Enterprise Data Services |date=October 2009 |publisher=[[International Data Corporation|IDC]] |url=http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/data/sw-library/ims/idc-power-of-ims.pdf |access-date=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; IMS stores data [[Hierarchical database model|hierarchically]],{{sfnp|Ward|Dafoulas|2006|p=2|ps=none}} but in the 1970s [[Edgar F. Codd|Ted Codd]] proposed an alternative relational storage model based on [[set theory]] and [[predicate logic]] and the familiar concepts of tables, rows and columns. The first commercially available [[relational database management system]] (RDBMS) was available from [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] in 1981.{{sfnp|Ward|Dafoulas|2006|p=3|ps=none}}

All database management systems consist of a number of components that together allow the data they store to be accessed simultaneously by many users while maintaining its integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BcOUCgAAQBAJ|title=Database System Concepts|last=Silberschatz|first=Abraham|date=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|isbn=978-0-07-741800-7|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A characteristic of all databases is that the structure of the data they contain is defined and stored separately from the data itself, in a [[database schema]].{{sfnp|Ward|Dafoulas|2006|p=2|ps=none}}

The [[XML|extensible markup language]] (XML) has become a popular format for data representation in recent years. Although XML data can be stored in normal [[file system]]s, it is commonly held in [[relational database]]s to take advantage of their "robust implementation verified by years of both theoretical and practical effort".{{sfnp|Pardede|2009|p=2|ps=none}} As an evolution of the [[Standard Generalized Markup Language]] (SGML), XML's text-based structure offers the advantage of being both machine and human-readable.{{sfnp|Pardede|2009|p=4|ps=none}}

===Data retrieval===
The relational database model introduced a programming-language independent [[SQL|Structured Query Language]] (SQL), based on [[relational algebra]].

The terms "data" and "information" are not synonymous. Anything stored is data, but it only becomes information when it is organized and presented meaningfully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kedar |first1=Seema |title=Database Management System |date=2009 |publisher=Technical Publications |isbn=9788184316049 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SELyJ4a5nTcC |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–9}} Most of the world's digital data is unstructured, and stored in a variety of different physical formats{{sfnp|van der Aalst|2011|p=2|ps=none}}{{efn|name=format|"Format" refers to the physical characteristics of the stored data such as its [[character encoding|encoding]] scheme; "structure" describes the organisation of that data.}} even within a single organization. [[Data warehouse]]s began to be developed in the 1980s to integrate these disparate stores. They typically contain data extracted from various sources, including external sources such as the Internet, organized in such a way as to facilitate [[decision support system]]s (DSS).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Dyché |first=Jill |title=Turning Data Into Information With Data Warehousing |year=2000 |publisher=Addison Wesley |isbn=978-0-201-65780-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4–6}}

===Data transmission===
[[Data transmission]] has three aspects: transmission, propagation, and reception.{{sfnp|Weik|2000|p=361|ps=none}} It can be broadly categorized as [[broadcasting]], in which information is transmitted unidirectionally downstream, or [[telecommunications]], with bidirectional upstream and downstream channels.{{r|HilbertLopez2011}}

XML has been increasingly employed as a means of data interchange since the early 2000s,{{sfnp|Pardede|2009|p=xiii|ps=none}} particularly for machine-oriented interactions such as those involved in web-oriented [[communications protocol|protocols]] such as [[SOAP]],{{sfnp|Pardede|2009|p=4|ps=none}} describing "data-in-transit rather than&amp;nbsp;... data-at-rest".{{sfnp|Pardede|2009|p=xiii|ps=none}}  One of the challenges of such usage is converting data from relational databases into XML [[Document Object Model]] (DOM) structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Lewis |first=Bryn |contribution=Extraction of XML from Relational Databases |title=XML-Based Data Management and Multimedia Engineering&amp;nbsp;– EDBT 2002 Workshops |year=2003 |editor1-first=Akmal B. |editor1-last=Chaudhri |editor2-first=Chabane |editor2-last=Djeraba |editor3-first=Rainer |editor3-last=Unland |editor4-first=Wolfgang |editor4-last=Lindner |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3540001300}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|228–31}}

===Data manipulation===
Hilbert and Lopez identify the exponential pace of technological change (a kind of [[Moore's law]]): machines' application-specific capacity to compute information per capita roughly doubled every 14 months between 1986 and 2007; the per capita capacity of the world's general-purpose computers doubled every 18 months during the same two decades; the global telecommunication capacity per capita doubled every 34 months; the world's storage capacity per capita required roughly 40 months to double (every 3 years); and per capita broadcast information has doubled every 12.3 years.{{r|HilbertLopez2011}}

Massive amounts of data are stored worldwide every day, but unless it can be analysed and presented effectively it essentially resides in what have been called data tombs: "data archives that are seldom visited".{{sfnp|Han|Kamber|Pei|2011|p=5|ps=none}} To address that issue, the field of [[data mining]]&amp;nbsp;– "the process of discovering interesting patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data"{{sfnp|Han|Kamber|Pei|2011|p=8|ps=none}}&amp;nbsp;– emerged in the late 1980s.{{sfnp|Han|Kamber|Pei|2011|p=xxiii|ps=none}}

==Perspectives==

===Academic perspective===
In an academic context, the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] defines IT as "undergraduate degree programs that prepare students to meet the computer technology needs of business, government, healthcare, schools, and other kinds of organizations&amp;nbsp;.... IT specialists assume responsibility for selecting hardware and software products appropriate for an organization, integrating those products with organizational needs and infrastructure, and installing, customizing, and maintaining those applications for the organization’s computer users."&lt;ref name="curricula"&gt;The Joint Task Force for Computing Curricula 2005.[http://www.acm.org/education/curric_vols/CC2005-March06Final.pdf Computing Curricula 2005: The Overview Report (pdf)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021153204/http://www.acm.org/education/curric_vols/CC2005-March06Final.pdf |date=21 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial and employment perspective===
Companies in the information technology field are often discussed as a group as the "tech sector" or the "tech industry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Technology Sector Snapshot|url=http://markets.on.nytimes.com/research/markets/usmarkets/sectors.asp?sector=57|accessdate=12 January 2017|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Our programmes, campaigns and partnerships |url=https://www.techuk.org/focus|publisher=TechUK |access-date=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyberstates 2016|url=https://www.comptia.org/resources/cyberstates-2016|publisher=CompTIA|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Defining ICT in a Boundaryless World: The Development of a Working Hierarchy"&gt;{{citation |last=Zuppo |first=Colrain M. |title=Defining ICT in a Boundaryless World: The Development of a Working Hierarchy |publisher=International Journal of Managing Information Technology (IJMIT) |page=19 |url=http://www.airccse.org/journal/ijmit/papers/4312ijmit02.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a business context, the [[Information Technology Association of America]] has defined information technology as "the study, design, development, application, implementation, support or management of computer-based information systems".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Proctor |first=K. Scott |title=Optimizing and Assessing Information Technology: Improving Business Project Execution |year=2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-1-118-10263-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2017}} The responsibilities of those working in the field include network administration, software development and installation, and the planning and management of an organization's technology life cycle, by which hardware and software are maintained, upgraded and replaced.

The business value of information technology lies in the automation of business processes, provision of information for decision making, connecting businesses with their customers, and the provision of productivity tools to increase efficiency.

===Ethical perspectives===
{{main|Information ethics}}
The field of information ethics was established by mathematician [[Norbert Wiener]] in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Bynum |first=Terrell Ward |contribution=Norbert Wiener and the Rise of Information Ethics |title=Information Technology and Moral Philosophy |year=2008 |editor1-last=van den Hoven |editor1-first=Jeroen |editor2-last=Weckert |editor2-first=John |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-85549-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}} Some of the ethical issues associated with the use of information technology include:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Reynolds |first=George |title=Ethics in Information Technology |year=2009 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-538-74622-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20–21}}

'''Subterranea''' refers to underground structures, both natural (such as [[cave]]s) and man-made (such as [[Mining|mine]]s). Some subterranean features are secret places (see also [[:Category:Secret places]]); most, like road [[tunnel]]s, [[subway system]]s and [[Sewerage|sewer]]s, are parts of [[public infrastructure]].

The '''atmosphere of Earth''' is the layer of [[gas]]es, commonly known as '''air''', that surrounds the planet [[Earth]] and is retained by [[gravity of Earth|Earth's gravity]]. The atmosphere of Earth protects [[life]] on Earth by creating [[atmospheric pressure|pressure]] allowing for [[liquid water]] to exist on the Earth's [[planetary surface|surface]], absorbing [[ultraviolet]] [[solar radiation]], warming the surface through heat retention ([[greenhouse effect]]), and reducing temperature extremes between [[daytime|day]] and [[night]] (the [[diurnal temperature variation]]).

By volume, dry air contains 78.09% [[nitrogen]], 20.95% [[oxygen]],&lt;ref name="NYT-20131003"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Zimmer |title=Earth’s Oxygen: A Mystery Easy to Take for Granted |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/03/science/earths-oxygen-a-mystery-easy-to-take-for-granted.html |date=3 October 2013 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 0.93% [[argon]], 0.04% [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|carbon dioxide]], and small amounts of other gases. Air also contains a variable amount of [[Water vapor#Water vapor in Earth's atmosphere|water vapor]], on average around 1% at sea level, and 0.4% over the entire atmosphere. Air content and [[atmospheric pressure]] vary at different layers, and air suitable for use in [[photosynthesis]] by [[terrestrial plant]]s and [[breathing]] of [[terrestrial animal]]s is found only in Earth's [[troposphere]] and in [[breathing gas|artificial atmospheres]].

The atmosphere has a mass of about 5.15{{e|18}}&amp;nbsp;kg,&lt;ref&gt;Lide, David R. ''Handbook of Chemistry and Physics''. Boca Raton, FL: CRC, 1996: 14–17&lt;/ref&gt; three quarters of which is within about {{convert|11|km|mi ft|abbr=on}} of the surface. The atmosphere becomes thinner and thinner with increasing altitude, with no definite boundary between the atmosphere and [[outer space]]. The [[Kármán line]], at {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}}, or 1.57% of Earth's radius, is often used as the border between the atmosphere and outer space. Atmospheric effects become noticeable during [[atmospheric reentry]] of spacecraft at an altitude of around {{convert|120|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Several [[Atmospheric stratification|layers]] can be distinguished in the atmosphere, based on characteristics such as temperature and composition.

The study of Earth's atmosphere and its processes is called [[Atmospheric sciences|atmospheric science]] (aerology). Early pioneers in the field include [[Léon Teisserenc de Bort]] and [[Richard Assmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=M. Vázquez|author2=A.

[[File:Atmospheric Water Vapor Mean.2005.030.jpg|thumb|right|Mean atmospheric water vapor]]

The three major constituents of Earth's atmosphere are [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[argon]]. Water vapor accounts for roughly 0.25% of the atmosphere by mass. The concentration of water vapor (a greenhouse gas) varies significantly from around 10 ppm by volume in the coldest portions of the atmosphere to as much as 5% by volume in hot, humid air masses, and concentrations of other atmospheric gases are typically quoted in terms of dry air (without water vapor).&lt;ref name="WallaceHobbs"&gt;Wallace, John M. and Peter V.

Filtered air includes trace amounts of many other [[chemical compound]]s. Many substances of natural origin may be present in locally and seasonally variable small amounts as [[aerosol]]s in an unfiltered air sample, including [[dust]] of mineral and organic composition, [[pollen]] and [[spores]], [[sea spray]], and [[volcanic ash]]. Various industrial [[pollutant]]s also may be present as gases or aerosols, such as [[chlorine]] (elemental or in compounds), [[fluorine]] compounds and elemental [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] vapor. Sulfur compounds such as [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) may be derived from natural sources or from industrial air pollution.

Layers drawn to scale, objects within the layers are not to scale. Aurorae shown here at the bottom of the thermosphere can actually form at any altitude in this atmospheric layer.]]

In general, air pressure and density decrease with altitude in the atmosphere. However, temperature has a more complicated profile with altitude, and may remain relatively constant or even increase with altitude in some regions (see the [[Atmosphere of Earth#Temperature and speed of sound|temperature]] section, below). Because the general pattern of the temperature/altitude profile is constant and measurable by means of instrumented [[Weather balloon|balloon soundings]], the temperature behavior provides a useful metric to distinguish atmospheric layers. In this way, Earth's atmosphere can be divided (called atmospheric stratification) into five main layers. Excluding the exosphere, the atmosphere has four primary layers, which are the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/science/mos-upper-atmosphere.html#.VHg5AzHF8vY |title=Earth's Upper Atmosphere |last=Zell |first=Holly |date=2015-03-02 |newspaper=NASA|access-date=2017-02-20 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; From highest to lowest, the five main layers are:
* Exosphere: 700 to 10,000&amp;nbsp;km (440 to 6,200 miles)
* Thermosphere: 80 to 700&amp;nbsp;km (50 to 440 miles)&lt;ref name="thermosphere"&gt;{{cite web |author=Randy Russell |title=The Thermosphere |year=2008 |url=http://www.windows2universe.org/earth/Atmosphere/thermosphere.html |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mesosphere: 50 to 80&amp;nbsp;km (31 to 50 miles)
* Stratosphere: 12 to 50&amp;nbsp;km (7 to 31 miles)
* Troposphere: 0 to 12&amp;nbsp;km (0 to 7 miles)&lt;ref name=tropopauseheight&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-das.uwyo.edu/~geerts/cwx/notes/chap01/tropo.html |title=The height of the tropopause |publisher=Das.uwyo.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exosphere===
{{main|Exosphere}}
The exosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere (i.e. the upper limit of the atmosphere). It extends from the [[exobase]], which is located at the top of the thermosphere at an altitude of about 700&amp;nbsp;km above sea level, to about 10,000&amp;nbsp;km (6,200&amp;nbsp;mi; 33,000,000&amp;nbsp;ft) where it merges into the [[solar wind]].

This layer is mainly composed of extremely low densities of hydrogen, helium and several heavier molecules including nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide closer to the exobase. The atoms and molecules are so far apart that they can travel hundreds of kilometers without colliding with one another. Thus, the exosphere no longer behaves like a gas, and the particles constantly escape into space. These free-moving particles follow [[ballistic trajectories]] and may migrate in and out of the [[magnetosphere]] or the solar wind.

The exosphere is located too far above Earth for any meteorological phenomena to be possible. However, the [[aurora borealis]] and [[aurora australis]] sometimes occur in the lower part of the exosphere, where they overlap into the thermosphere. The exosphere contains most of the satellites orbiting Earth.

===Thermosphere===
{{main|Thermosphere}}
The thermosphere is the second-highest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It extends from the mesopause (which separates it from the mesosphere) at an altitude of about {{convert|80|km|mi ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} up to the [[thermopause]] at an altitude range of {{convert|500|-|1000|km|mi ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2|comma=5}}. The height of the thermopause varies considerably due to changes in solar activity.&lt;ref name="thermosphere"/&gt; Because the thermopause lies at the lower boundary of the exosphere, it is also referred to as the [[exobase]]. The lower part of the thermosphere, from {{convert|80|to|550|km}} above Earth's surface, contains the [[ionosphere]].

The temperature of the thermosphere gradually increases with height. Unlike the stratosphere beneath it, wherein a temperature [[inversion (meteorology)|inversion]] is due to the absorption of radiation by ozone, the inversion in the thermosphere occurs due to the extremely low density of its molecules. The temperature of this layer can rise as high as {{convert|1500|C|abbr=on|sigfig=2|comma=5}}, though the gas molecules are so far apart that its [[Kinetic theory of gases|temperature in the usual sense]] is not very meaningful. The air is so rarefied that an individual molecule (of [[oxygen]], for example) travels an average of {{convert|1|km|mi ft|comma=5}} between collisions with other molecules.&lt;ref&gt;Ahrens, C. Donald. Essentials of Meteorology. Published by Thomson Brooks/Cole, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the thermosphere has a high proportion of molecules with high energy, it would not feel hot to a human in direct contact, because its density is too low to conduct a significant amount of energy to or from the skin.

This layer is completely cloudless and free of water vapor. However, non-hydrometeorological phenomena such as the [[aurora borealis]] and [[aurora australis]] are occasionally seen in the thermosphere. The [[International Space Station]] orbits in this layer, between {{convert|350|and|420|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}.

===Mesosphere===
{{main|Mesosphere}}
The mesosphere is the third highest layer of Earth's atmosphere, occupying the region above the stratosphere and below the thermosphere. It extends from the stratopause at an altitude of about {{convert|50|km|mi ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} to the mesopause at {{convert|80|-|85|km|mi ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} above sea level.

Temperatures drop with increasing altitude to the [[mesopause]] that marks the top of this middle layer of the atmosphere. It is the coldest place on Earth and has an average temperature around {{convert|-85|C|F K|abbr=on|lk=on|sigfig=2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=States |first=Robert J. |last2=Gardner |first2=Chester S. |title=Thermal Structure of the Mesopause Region (80–105 km) at 40°N Latitude.

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Joe Buchdahl |url=http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/Atmosphere/Older/Mesosphere.html |title=Atmosphere, Climate &amp; Environment Information Programme |publisher=Ace.mmu.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701030705/http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/atmosphere/older/mesosphere.html |archivedate=2010-07-01 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just below the mesopause, the air is so cold that even the very scarce water vapor at this altitude can be sublimated into polar-mesospheric [[noctilucent cloud]]s. These are the highest clouds in the atmosphere and may be visible to the naked eye if sunlight reflects off them about an hour or two after sunset or a similar length of time before sunrise. They are most readily visible when the Sun is around 4 to 16 degrees below the horizon. Lightning-induced discharges known as [[upper-atmospheric lightning|transient luminous events (TLEs)]] occasionally form in the mesosphere above tropospheric [[cumulonimbus cloud|thunderclouds]]. The mesosphere is also the layer where most [[meteor]]s burn up upon atmospheric entrance. It is too high above Earth to be accessible to jet-powered aircraft and balloons, and too low to permit orbital spacecraft. The mesosphere is mainly accessed by [[sounding rocket]]s and rocket-powered aircraft.

===Stratosphere===
{{main|Stratosphere}}

The stratosphere is the second-lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It lies above the troposphere and is separated from it by the [[tropopause]]. This layer extends from the top of the troposphere at roughly {{convert|12|km|mi ft|abbr=on}} above Earth's surface to the [[stratopause]] at an altitude of about {{convert|50|to|55|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}.

The atmospheric pressure at the top of the stratosphere is roughly 1/1000 the pressure at [[Sea level pressure|sea level]]. It contains the ozone layer, which is the part of Earth's atmosphere that contains relatively high concentrations of that gas. The stratosphere defines a layer in which temperatures rise with increasing altitude. This rise in temperature is caused by the absorption of [[ultraviolet radiation]] (UV) radiation from the Sun by the [[ozone layer]], which restricts turbulence and mixing. Although the temperature may be {{convert|-60|C|F K|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} at the tropopause, the top of the stratosphere is much warmer, and may be near 0&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="stratopause"&gt;{{cite web |author=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences |title=stratopause |year=1993 |url=http://www.webref.org/chemistry/s/stratopause.htm |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stratospheric temperature profile creates very stable atmospheric conditions, so the stratosphere lacks the weather-producing air turbulence that is so prevalent in the troposphere. Consequently, the stratosphere is almost completely free of clouds and other forms of weather. However, polar stratospheric or [[nacreous cloud]]s are occasionally seen in the lower part of this layer of the atmosphere where the air is coldest. The stratosphere is the highest layer that can be accessed by jet-powered aircraft.

===Troposphere===
{{main|Troposphere}}
The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It extends from Earth's surface to an average height of about {{cvt|12|km|mi ft}}, although this [[altitude]] varies from about {{cvt|9|km|mi ft}} at the [[geographic pole]]s to {{cvt|17|km|mi ft}} at the [[Equator]],&lt;ref name=tropopauseheight/&gt; with some variation due to weather. The troposphere is bounded above by the [[tropopause]], a boundary marked in most places by a [[temperature inversion]] (i.e. a layer of relatively warm air above a colder one), and in others by a zone which is [[Isotherm (contour line)|isothermal]] with height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barry |first1=R.G. |last2=Chorley |first2=R.J. |year=1971 |title=Atmosphere, Weather and Climate |location=London |publisher=Menthuen &amp; Co Ltd. |page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tyson |first1=P.D. |last2=Preston-Whyte |first2=R.A. |year=2013 |title=The Weather and Climate of Southern Africa |edition=2nd |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although variations do occur, the temperature usually declines with increasing altitude in the troposphere because the troposphere is mostly heated through energy transfer from the surface. Thus, the lowest part of the troposphere (i.e. Earth's surface) is typically the warmest section of the troposphere. This promotes vertical mixing (hence, the origin of its name in the Greek word τρόπος, ''tropos'', meaning "turn"). The troposphere contains roughly 80% of the [[mass]] of Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |title=Concise Encyclopedia of Science &amp; Technology |year=1984 |section=Troposphere |quote=It contains about four-fifths of the mass of the whole atmosphere.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The troposphere is denser than all its overlying atmospheric layers because a larger atmospheric weight sits on top of the troposphere and causes it to be most severely compressed. Fifty percent of the total mass of the atmosphere is located in the lower {{cvt|5.6|km|mi ft}} of the troposphere.

Nearly all atmospheric water vapor or moisture is found in the troposphere, so it is the layer where most of Earth's weather takes place. It has basically all the weather-associated cloud genus types generated by active wind circulation, although very tall cumulonimbus thunder clouds can penetrate the tropopause from below and rise into the lower part of the stratosphere. Most conventional [[aviation]] activity takes place in the troposphere, and it is the only layer that can be accessed by propeller-driven aircraft.

Because of the angle of the photo, it appears to straddle the stratosphere and mesosphere that actually lie more than 250&amp;nbsp;km below. The orange layer is the [[troposphere]], which gives way to the whitish [[stratosphere]] and then the blue [[mesosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ISS022-E-062672 caption |url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-130/html/iss022e062672.html |publisher=[[NASA]] |access-date=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Other layers===
Within the five principal layers above, that are largely determined by temperature, several secondary layers may be distinguished by other properties:
* The [[ozone layer]] is contained within the stratosphere. In this layer [[ozone]] concentrations are about 2 to 8 parts per million, which is much higher than in the lower atmosphere but still very small compared to the main components of the atmosphere. It is mainly located in the lower portion of the stratosphere from about {{convert|15|-|35|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}, though the thickness varies seasonally and geographically. About 90% of the ozone in Earth's atmosphere is contained in the stratosphere.
* The [[ionosphere]] is a region of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation. It is responsible for [[Aurora (astronomy)|auroras]]. During daytime hours, it stretches from {{convert|50|to|1000|km|mi ft|abbr=on}} and includes the mesosphere, thermosphere, and parts of the exosphere. However, ionization in the mesosphere largely ceases during the night, so auroras are normally seen only in the thermosphere and lower exosphere. The ionosphere forms the inner edge of the [[magnetosphere]]. It has practical importance because it influences, for example, radio propagation on Earth.
* The homosphere and heterosphere are defined by whether the atmospheric gases are well mixed. The surface-based homosphere includes the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and the lowest part of the thermosphere, where the chemical composition of the atmosphere does not depend on molecular weight because the gases are mixed by turbulence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=homosphere1 |title=''homosphere'' – AMS Glossary |publisher=Amsglossary.allenpress.com |accessdate=2010-10-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914045832/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=homosphere1 |archivedate=14 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relatively homogeneous layer ends at the ''[[turbopause]]'' found at about {{convert|100|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}, the very [[Kármán line|edge of space]] itself as accepted by the [[Federation Aeronautique Internationale|FAI]], which places it about {{convert|20|km|mi ft|abbr=on}} above the mesopause.
:Above this altitude lies the heterosphere, which includes the exosphere and most of the thermosphere. Here, the chemical composition varies with altitude. This is because the [[mean free path|distance that particles can move without colliding with one another]] is large compared with the size of motions that cause mixing. This allows the gases to stratify by molecular weight, with the heavier ones, such as oxygen and nitrogen, present only near the bottom of the heterosphere. The upper part of the heterosphere is composed almost completely of hydrogen, the lightest element.{{clarify|reason=so what is the intermediate region of the heterosphere composed of??|date=February 2016}}
* The [[planetary boundary layer]] is the part of the troposphere that is closest to Earth's surface and is directly affected by it, mainly through [[turbulence|turbulent diffusion]]. During the day the planetary boundary layer usually is well-mixed, whereas at night it becomes stably stratified with weak or intermittent mixing. The depth of the planetary boundary layer ranges from as little as about {{convert|100|m|ft}} on clear, calm nights to {{convert |3000|m|ft|abbr=on}} or more during the afternoon in dry regions.

==Physical properties==
{{Comparison US standard atmosphere 1962.svg}}

===Pressure and thickness===
{{Main|Atmospheric pressure}}

The average atmospheric pressure at sea level is defined by the [[International Standard Atmosphere]] as {{convert|101325|Pa|Torr psi mmHg|lk=on|comma=off}}. This is sometimes referred to as a unit of [[Atmosphere (unit)|standard atmospheres (atm)]]. Total atmospheric mass is 5.1480×10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; kg (1.135×10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; lb),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Mass of the Atmosphere: A Constraint on Global Analyses |journal=Journal of Climate |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=864 |date=1970-01-01 |doi=10.1175/JCLI-3299.1 |bibcode = 2005JCli...18..864T|last1 = Trenberth|first1 = Kevin E.|last2=Smith |first2=Lesley }}&lt;/ref&gt; about 2.5% less than would be inferred from the average sea level pressure and Earth's area of 51007.2 megahectares, this portion being displaced by Earth's mountainous terrain. Atmospheric pressure is the total weight of the air above unit area at the point where the pressure is measured. Thus air pressure varies with location and [[low-pressure area|weather]].

If the entire mass of the atmosphere had a uniform density equal to sea level density (about 1.2 kg per m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) from sea level upwards, it would terminate abruptly at an altitude of {{convert|8.50|km|ft|abbr=on}}. It actually decreases exponentially with altitude, dropping by half every {{convert|5.6|km|ft|abbr=on}} or by a factor of 1/[[e (mathematical constant)|e]] every {{convert|7.64|km|ft|abbr=on}}, the average [[scale height]] of the atmosphere below {{convert|70|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}. However, the atmosphere is more accurately modeled with a customized equation for each layer that takes gradients of temperature, molecular composition, solar radiation and gravity into account.

In summary, the mass of Earth's atmosphere is distributed approximately as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Lutgens, Frederick K. and Edward J. Tarbuck (1995) ''The Atmosphere'', Prentice Hall, 6th ed., pp. 14–17, {{ISBN|0-13-350612-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 50% is below {{convert|5.6|km|ft|abbr=on}}.
* 90% is below {{convert|16|km|ft|abbr=on}}.
* 99.99997% is below {{convert|100|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}, the [[Kármán line]]. By international convention, this marks the beginning of space where human travelers are considered [[astronaut]]s.

By comparison, the summit of Mt. Everest is at {{convert|8848|m|ft|abbr=on}};
commercial [[airliners]] typically cruise between {{convert|10|and|13|km|ft|abbr=on}} where the thinner air improves fuel economy; [[weather balloons]] reach {{convert|30.4|km|ft|abbr=on}} and above; and the highest [[North American X-15|X-15]] flight in 1963 reached {{convert|108.0|km|ft|abbr=on}}.

Even above the Kármán line, significant atmospheric effects such as [[aurora (astronomy)|auroras]] still occur. [[Meteors]] begin to glow in this region, though the larger ones may not burn up until they penetrate more deeply. The various layers of Earth's [[ionosphere]], important to [[HF radio]] propagation, begin below 100&amp;nbsp;km and extend beyond 500&amp;nbsp;km. By comparison, the [[International Space Station]] and [[Space Shuttle]] typically orbit at 350–400&amp;nbsp;km, within the [[F-layer]] of the ionosphere where they encounter enough [[atmospheric drag]] to require reboosts every few months. Depending on solar activity, satellites can experience noticeable atmospheric drag at altitudes as high as 700–800&amp;nbsp;km.

=== Temperature and speed of sound ===
{{Main|Atmospheric temperature|Speed of sound}}
[[File:Atmospheric Temperature Trend.jpg|thumb|Temperature trends in two thick layers of the atmosphere as measured between January 1979 and December 2005 by [[Microwave Sounding Unit]]s and [[Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit]]s on [[NOAA]] weather satellites.  The instruments record microwaves emitted from oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. Source:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=7839 |title=Atmospheric Temperature Trends, 1979–2005 : Image of the Day |publisher=Earthobservatory.nasa.gov |date=2000-01-01 |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The division of the atmosphere into layers mostly by reference to temperature is discussed above. Temperature decreases with altitude starting at sea level, but variations in this trend begin above 11&amp;nbsp;km, where the temperature stabilizes through a large vertical distance through the rest of the troposphere. In the [[stratosphere]], starting above about 20&amp;nbsp;km, the temperature increases with height, due to heating within the ozone layer caused by capture of significant [[ultraviolet]] radiation from the [[Sun]] by the dioxygen and ozone gas in this region. Still another region of increasing temperature with altitude occurs at very high altitudes, in the aptly-named [[thermosphere]] above 90&amp;nbsp;km.

Because in an [[ideal gas]] of constant composition the [[speed of sound]] depends only on temperature and not on the gas pressure or density, the speed of sound in the atmosphere with altitude takes on the form of the complicated temperature profile (see illustration to the right), and does not mirror altitudinal changes in density or pressure.

===Density and mass===
[[File:Atmosphere model.png|thumb|Temperature and mass density against altitude from the [[NRLMSISE-00]] [[International Standard Atmosphere|standard atmosphere]] model (the eight dotted lines in each "decade" are at the eight cubes 8, 27, 64, ..., 729)]]

{{Main|Density of air}}

The density of air at sea level is about 1.2&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (1.2&amp;nbsp;g/L, 0.0012 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Density is not measured directly but is calculated from measurements of temperature, pressure and humidity using the equation of state for air (a form of the [[ideal gas law]]). Atmospheric density decreases as the altitude increases. This variation can be approximately modeled using the [[barometric formula]]. More sophisticated models are used to predict orbital decay of satellites.

The average mass of the atmosphere is about 5 quadrillion (5{{e|15}}) [[tonne]]s or 1/1,200,000 the mass of Earth. According to the American [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]], "The total mean mass of the atmosphere is 5.1480{{E|18}}&amp;nbsp;kg with an annual range due to water vapor of 1.2 or 1.5{{E|15}}&amp;nbsp;kg, depending on whether surface pressure or water vapor data are used; somewhat smaller than the previous estimate. The mean mass of water vapor is estimated as 1.27{{E|16}}&amp;nbsp;kg and the dry air mass as 5.1352 ±0.0003{{E|18}}&amp;nbsp;kg."

==Optical properties==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}
{{See also|Sunlight}}
Solar [[radiation]] (or sunlight) is the energy Earth receives from the [[Sun]]. Earth also emits radiation back into space, but at longer wavelengths that we cannot see. Part of the incoming and emitted radiation is absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be [[Reflection (physics)|reflected light]] from [[ice crystals]] in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="NYT-20170519"&gt;{{cite news |last=St. Fleur |first=Nicholas |title=Spotting Mysterious Twinkles on Earth From a Million Miles Away |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/science/dscovr-satellite-ice-glints-earth-atmosphere.html |date=19 May 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GRL-201760515"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marshak |first1=Alexander |last2=Várnai |first2=Tamás |last3=Kostinski |first3=Alexander |title=Terrestrial glint seen from deep space: oriented ice crystals detected from the Lagrangian point |date=15 May 2017 |journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]] |volume=44 |issue=10 |page=5197 |doi=10.1002/2017GL073248 |bibcode=2017GeoRL..44.5197M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scattering===
{{Main|Atmospheric scattering}}
When light passes through Earth's atmosphere, [[photon]]s interact with it through ''scattering''. If the light does not interact with the atmosphere, it is called ''direct radiation'' and is what you see if you were to look directly at the Sun. ''Indirect radiation'' is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere. For example, on an [[overcast]] day when you cannot see your shadow there is no direct radiation reaching you, it has all been scattered. As another example, due to a phenomenon called [[Rayleigh scattering]], shorter (blue) wavelengths scatter more easily than longer (red) wavelengths. This is why the sky looks blue; you are seeing scattered blue light. This is also why sunsets are red. Because the Sun is close to the horizon, the Sun's rays pass through more atmosphere than normal to reach your eye. Much of the blue light has been scattered out, leaving the red light in a sunset.

===Absorption===
{{Main|Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)}}
[[File:Atmospheric electromagnetic opacity.svg|thumb|Rough plot of Earth's atmospheric [[transmittance]] (or opacity) to various wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, including [[visible light]].]]

Different molecules absorb different wavelengths of radiation. For example, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; absorb almost all wavelengths shorter than 300 [[nanometer]]s. Water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) absorbs many wavelengths above 700&amp;nbsp;nm. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it increases the energy of the molecule. This heats the atmosphere, but the atmosphere also cools by emitting radiation, as discussed below.

The combined [[absorption spectra]] of the gases in the atmosphere leave "windows" of low [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]], allowing the transmission of only certain bands of light. The [[optical window]] runs from around 300&amp;nbsp;nm ([[ultraviolet]]-C) up into the range humans can see, the [[visible spectrum]] (commonly called light), at roughly 400–700&amp;nbsp;nm and continues to the [[infrared]] to around 1100&amp;nbsp;nm. There are also [[Infrared window|infrared]] and [[radio window]]s that transmit some infrared and [[radio waves]] at longer wavelengths. For example, the radio window runs from about one centimeter to about eleven-meter waves.

===Emission===
{{further|Emission (electromagnetic radiation)}}

''Emission'' is the opposite of absorption, it is when an object emits radiation. Objects tend to emit amounts and wavelengths of radiation depending on their "[[black body]]" emission curves, therefore hotter objects tend to emit more radiation, with shorter wavelengths. Colder objects emit less radiation, with longer wavelengths. For example, the Sun is approximately {{convert|6000|K|lk=on}}, its radiation peaks near 500&amp;nbsp;nm, and is visible to the human eye. Earth is approximately {{convert|290|K|abbr=on}}, so its radiation peaks near 10,000&amp;nbsp;nm, and is much too long to be visible to humans.

Because of its temperature, the atmosphere emits infrared radiation. For example, on clear nights Earth's surface cools down faster than on cloudy nights. This is because clouds (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) are strong absorbers and emitters of infrared radiation. This is also why it becomes colder at night at higher elevations.

The [[greenhouse effect]] is directly related to this absorption and emission effect. Some gases in the atmosphere absorb and emit infrared radiation, but do not interact with sunlight in the visible spectrum. Common examples of these are {{CO2}} and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

===Refractive index===
{{main|Atmospheric refraction}}
{{See also|Scintillation (astronomy)}}

The [[refractive index]] of air is close to, but just greater than 1. Systematic variations in refractive index can lead to the bending of light rays over long optical paths. One example is that, under some circumstances, observers onboard ships can see other vessels just over the [[horizon]] because light is refracted in the same direction as the [[curvature]] of Earth's surface.

The refractive index of air depends on temperature,&lt;ref name="Edlén"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Bengt |last=Edlén |date=1966 |journal=Metrologia |volume=2 |issue=2 |title=The refractive index of air |pages=71–80 |doi=10.1088/0026-1394/2/2/002 |bibcode=1966Metro...2...71E }}&lt;/ref&gt; giving rise to refraction effects when the temperature gradient is large. An example of such effects is the [[mirage]].

==Circulation==
{{Main|Atmospheric circulation}}

[[File:AtmosphCirc2.png|thumb|right|An idealised view of three large circulation cells.]]
''Atmospheric circulation'' is the large-scale movement of air through the troposphere, and the means (with [[ocean circulation]]) by which heat is distributed around Earth. The large-scale structure of the atmospheric circulation varies from year to year, but the basic structure remains fairly constant because it is determined by Earth's rotation rate and the difference in solar radiation between the equator and poles.

==Evolution of Earth's atmosphere==
{{See also|History of Earth|Paleoclimatology}}

===Earliest atmosphere===
The [[paleoatmosphere|first atmosphere]] consisted of gases in the [[Solar nebula#Formation of planets|solar nebula]], primarily [[hydrogen]]. There were probably simple hydrides such as those now found in the [[gas giant]]s ([[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]]), notably water vapor, [[methane]] and [[ammonia]].&lt;ref name=Zahnle&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Zahnle |first1=K. |last2=Schaefer |first2=L. |last3=Fegley |first3=B. |doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a004895 |title=Earth's Earliest Atmospheres |journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology |volume=2 |issue=10 |pages=a004895 |year=2010 |pmid=20573713 |pmc=2944365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second atmosphere===
Outgassing from [[volcanism]], supplemented by gases produced during the [[late heavy bombardment]] of Earth by huge [[asteroids]], produced the next atmosphere, consisting largely of [[nitrogen]] plus [[carbon dioxide]] and inert gases.&lt;ref name=Zahnle/&gt; A major part of carbon-dioxide emissions dissolved in water and reacted with metals such as calcium and magnesium during weathering of crustal rocks to form carbonates that were deposited as sediments. Water-related sediments have been found that date from as early as 3.8 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;B. Windley: ''The Evolving Continents.'' Wiley Press, New York 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

About 3.4 billion years ago, nitrogen formed the major part of the then stable "second atmosphere". The influence of life has to be taken into account rather soon in the history of the atmosphere, because hints of early life-forms appear as early as 3.5 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;J. Schopf: ''Earth's Earliest Biosphere: Its Origin and Evolution.'' Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J., 1983&lt;/ref&gt; How Earth at that time maintained a climate warm enough for liquid water and life, if the early Sun put out 30% lower solar radiance than today, is a puzzle known as the "[[faint young Sun paradox]]".

The geological record however shows a continuous relatively warm surface during the complete early [[temperature record]] of Earth – with the exception of one cold glacial phase about 2.4 billion years ago. In the late [[Archean]] [[Eon (geology)|Eon]] an oxygen-containing atmosphere began to develop, apparently produced by photosynthesizing [[cyanobacteria]] (see [[Great Oxygenation Event]]), which have been found as [[stromatolite]] fossils from 2.7 billion years ago. The early basic carbon isotopy ([[isotope ratio]] proportions) strongly suggests conditions similar to the current, and that the fundamental features of the [[carbon cycle]] became established as early as 4 billion years ago.

[[Proxy (climate)#Lake and ocean sediments|Ancient sediments]] in the [[Gabon]] dating from between about 2,150 and 2,080 million years ago provide a record of Earth's dynamic oxygenation evolution. These fluctuations in oxygenation were likely driven by the [[Lomagundi carbon isotope excursion]].&lt;ref&gt;

The constant re-arrangement of continents by [[plate tectonics]] influences the long-term evolution of the atmosphere by transferring carbon dioxide to and from large continental carbonate stores. Free oxygen did not exist in the atmosphere until about 2.4 billion years ago during the [[Great Oxygenation Event]] and its appearance is indicated by the end of the [[banded iron formations]].

Before this time, any oxygen produced by photosynthesis was consumed by oxidation of reduced materials, notably iron. Molecules of free oxygen did not start to accumulate in the atmosphere until the rate of production of oxygen began to exceed the availability of reducing materials that removed oxygen. This point signifies a shift from a [[Redox|reducing]] atmosphere to an [[oxidizing]] atmosphere. O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; showed major variations until reaching a steady state of more than 15% by the end of the Precambrian.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher R. Scotese, [http://www.scotese.com/precamb_chart.htm Back to Earth History : Summary Chart for the Precambrian], Paleomar Project&lt;/ref&gt; The following time span from 541 million years ago to the present day is the [[Phanerozoic]] Eon, during the earliest period of which, the [[Cambrian]], oxygen-requiring [[metazoan]] life forms began to appear.

The amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has fluctuated over the last 600 million years, reaching a peak of about 30% around 280 million years ago, significantly higher than today's 21%. Two main processes govern changes in the atmosphere: Plants [[photosynthesis|use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere]], releasing oxygen. Breakdown of [[pyrite]] and [[volcanic eruption]]s release [[sulfur]] into the atmosphere, which oxidizes and hence reduces the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, volcanic eruptions also release carbon dioxide, which plants can convert to oxygen. The exact cause of the variation of the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is not known. Periods with much oxygen in the atmosphere are associated with rapid development of animals. Today's atmosphere contains 21% oxygen, which is great enough for this rapid development of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ward:[http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11630] Out of Thin Air: Dinosaurs, Birds, and Earth's Ancient Atmosphere&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Air pollution ===

{{Refimprove|date=October 2011}}
'''Underwater''' refers to the region below the surface of [[water]] where the water exists in a [[swimming pool]] or a natural feature (called a [[Water#Body of water|body of water]]) such as an [[ocean]], [[sea]], [[lake]], [[pond]], or [[river]].

==Extent==
Three quarters of the planet [[Earth]] is covered by water. A majority of the planet's solid surface is [[abyssal plain]], at depths between {{convert|4000|and|5500|m|ft}} below the surface of the oceans. The solid surface location on the planet closest to the centre of the orb is the [[Challenger Deep]], located in the [[Mariana Trench]] at a depth of {{convert|10,924|m|ft}}. Although a number of [[human]] activities are conducted underwater&amp;mdash;such as research, [[scuba diving]] for [[professional diving|work]] or [[recreational diving|recreation]], or even [[underwater warfare]] with [[submarines]], this very extensive environment on planet [[Earth]] is hostile to humans in many ways and therefore little explored. But it can be explored by [[sonar]], or more directly via manned or autonomous [[submersibles]]. The ocean floors have been surveyed via sonar to at least a coarse resolution; particularly-strategic areas have been mapped in detail, in the name of detecting enemy submarines, or aiding friendly ones, though the resulting maps may still be classified.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Constraints on non-aquatic life==
An immediate obstacle to human activity under water is the fact that human [[lung]]s cannot naturally function in this environment. Unlike the [[gill]]s of [[fish]], human lungs are adapted to the exchange of [[gas]]es at atmospheric [[pressure]], not [[liquid]]s. Aside from simply having insufficient musculature to rapidly move water in and out of the lungs, a more significant problem for all air-breathing animals, such as [[mammal]]s and [[bird]]s, is that water contains so little dissolved [[oxygen]] compared with atmospheric air. Air is around 21% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; water typically is less than 0.001% dissolved oxygen.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}{{clarify|date=June 2016}}{{dubious|date=November 2016}}

The [[density]] of water also causes problems that increase dramatically with depth. The [[atmospheric pressure]] at the surface is 14.7 pounds per square inch or around 100&amp;nbsp;kPa. A comparable water pressure occurs at a depth of only {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} ({{convert|9.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} for sea water). Thus, at about 10 m below the surface, the water exerts twice the pressure (2 atmospheres or 200&amp;nbsp;kPa) on the body as air at surface level.

For solids and liquids like bone, muscle and blood, this added pressure is not much of a problem; but it is a problem for any air-filled spaces like the [[mouth]], [[ear]]s, [[paranasal sinus]]es and lungs. This is because the air in those spaces reduces in volume when under pressure and so does not provide those spaces with support against the higher outside pressure. Even at a depth of {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}} underwater, an inability to equalize air pressure in the [[middle ear]] with outside water pressure can cause pain, and the [[tympanic membrane]] (eardrum) can rupture at depths under 10&amp;nbsp;ft (3&amp;nbsp;m). The danger of pressure damage is greatest in shallow water because the ratio of pressure change is greatest near the surface of the water. For example, the pressure increase between the surface and 10&amp;nbsp;m (33&amp;nbsp;ft) is 100% (100&amp;nbsp;kPa to 200&amp;nbsp;kPa), but the pressure increase from 30&amp;nbsp;m (100&amp;nbsp;ft) to 40&amp;nbsp;m (130&amp;nbsp;ft) is only 25% (400&amp;nbsp;kPa to 500&amp;nbsp;kPa).

==Buoyancy==
Any object immersed in water is provided with a [[buoyancy|buoyant]] force that counters the force of [[gravity]], appearing to make the object less heavy. If the overall density of the object exceeds the density of water, the object sinks. If the overall density is less than the density of water, the object rises until it floats on the surface.
[[image:Nur05018-Pillow lavas off Hawaii.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Note the bluish cast given to objects in this underwater photo of [[pillow lava]] ([[NOAA]]).]]

==Photic zone==
With increasing depth underwater, [[sunlight]] is absorbed, and the amount of visible [[light]] diminishes. Because absorption is greater for long [[wavelength]]s (red end of the [[visible spectrum]]) than for short wavelengths (blue end of the visible spectrum), the [[Optical spectrum|colour spectrum]] is rapidly altered with increasing depth. White objects at the surface appear bluish underwater, and red objects appear dark, even black. Although light penetration will be less if water is [[turbidity|turbid]], in the very clear water of the open ocean less than 25% of the surface light reaches a depth of 10&amp;nbsp;m (33&amp;nbsp;feet). At 100&amp;nbsp;m (330&amp;nbsp;ft) the light present from the sun is normally about 0.5% of that at the surface.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The [[Photic zone|euphotic depth]] is the depth at which light intensity falls to 1% of the value at the surface. This depth is dependent upon water clarity, being only a few metres underwater in a turbid estuary, but may reach up to 200 metres in the open ocean. At the euphotic depth, plants (such as [[phytoplankton]]) have no net energy gain from photosynthesis and thus cannot grow.

==Temperature==
There are three layers of ocean temperature: the [[Mixed layer#Oceanic mixed layer|surface layer]], the [[Thermocline#Oceans|thermocline]], and the [[Deep sea|deep ocean]]. The average temperature of surface layer is about 17&amp;nbsp;°C. About 90% of ocean's water is below the thermocline in the deep ocean, where most of the water is below 4&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Temperature of Ocean Water |website=Windows to the Universe |publisher=National Earth Science Teachers Association (NESTA) |url=https://www.windows2universe.org/?page=/earth/Water/temp.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conductivity==
Water [[thermal conductivity|conducts]] heat around 25 times more efficiently than air. [[Hypothermia]], a potentially fatal condition, occurs when the human body's core temperature falls below 35&amp;nbsp;°C. Insulating the body's warmth from water is the main purpose of [[diving suit]]s and [[exposure suit]]s when used in water temperatures below 25&amp;nbsp;°C.

[[Sound]] is transmitted about 4.3 [[Speed of sound|times faster in water]] (1,484&amp;nbsp;m/s in fresh water) as it is in air (343&amp;nbsp;m/s). The human brain can determine the direction of sound in air by detecting small differences in the time it takes for sound waves in air to reach each of the two ears. For these reasons divers find it difficult to determine the direction of sound underwater. However, some animals have adapted to this difference and many use sound to navigate underwater.

The earliest scientific models of the Universe were developed by [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek]] and [[Indian philosophers]] and were [[geocentric]], placing [[Earth]] at the center of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From China to Paris: 2000 Years Transmission of Mathematical Ideas |first=Yvonne |last=Dold-Samplonius |date=2002 |publisher=Franz Steiner Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book |title=Medieval Science Technology and Medicine: An Encyclopedia |author1=Thomas F. Glick |author2=Steven Livesey |author3=Faith Wallis |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] to develop the [[heliocentric model]] with the [[Sun]] at the center of the [[Solar System]]. In developing the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]], [[Isaac Newton]] built upon Copernicus' work as well as observations by [[Tycho Brahe]] and [[Johannes Kepler]]'s [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|laws of planetary motion]].

Further observational improvements led to the realization that the Sun is one of hundreds of billions of stars in the [[Milky Way]], which is one of at least hundreds of billions of galaxies in the Universe. Many of the stars in our galaxy [[exoplanet|have planets]]. [[Observable universe#End of Greatness|At the largest scale]] galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the Universe has neither an edge nor a center. At smaller scales, galaxies are distributed in [[galactic cluster|clusters]] and [[supercluster]]s which form immense [[Galaxy filament|filaments]] and [[Void (astronomy)|voids]] in space, creating a vast foam-like structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RLwangEACAAJ|title=An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics |last=Carroll|first=Bradley W.|last2=Ostlie|first2=Dale A.|date=2013-07-23|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-1-292-02293-2|edition=International|pages=1173–74|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the Universe had a beginning and that space has been expanding since then,&lt;ref name="Hawking"&gt;{{cite book |author=Hawking, Stephen |date=1988 |title=A Brief History of Time |publisher=Bantam Books |isbn=978-0-553-05340-1 |page=125 |authorlink=Stephen Hawking}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently still expanding at an increasing rate.&lt;ref name="nobel_2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2011/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2011 |accessdate=April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Big Bang]] theory is the prevailing [[cosmological]] description of the development of the Universe. Under this theory, space and time emerged together {{val|13.799|0.021|u=billion years}} ago&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Planck Collaboration|year=2016|title=Planck 2015 results.

After an [[inflationary epoch|initial accelerated expansion]] at around 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, and the separation of the four known [[fundamental forces]], the Universe gradually cooled and continued to expand, allowing the first [[subatomic particle]]s and simple [[atom]]s to form. [[Dark matter]] gradually gathered forming a [[foam]]-like structure of [[Galaxy filament|filaments]] and [[Void (astronomy)|voids]] under the influence of [[gravity]]. Giant clouds of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] were gradually drawn to the places where dark matter was most [[dense]], forming the first galaxies, stars, and everything else seen today. It is possible to see objects that are now further away than 13.799 billion [[light-year]]s because [[metric expansion of space|space itself has expanded]], and it is still expanding today. This means that objects which are now up to 46.5 billion light-years away can [[observable universe|still be seen]] in their distant past, because in the past when their light was emitted, they were much closer to the Earth.

From studying the movement of galaxies, it has been discovered that the universe contains much more [[matter]] than is accounted for by visible objects; stars, galaxies, nebulas and interstellar gas. This unseen matter is known as dark matter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Redd|first1=Nola|title=What is Dark Matter?|url=https://www.space.com/20930-dark-matter.html|website=Space.com|accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''dark'' means that there is a wide range of strong [[indirect evidence]] that it exists, but we have not yet detected it directly). The [[ΛCDM]] model is the most widely accepted model of our universe. It suggests that about {{val|69.2|1.2|u=%}} [2015] of the mass and energy in the universe is a [[cosmological constant]] (or, in extensions to ΛCDM, other forms of [[dark energy]] such as a [[scalar field]]) which is responsible for the current [[expansion of space]], and about {{val|25.8|1.1|u=%}} [2015] is dark matter.&lt;ref name="planck_2015"&gt;[https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2016/10/aa27101-15/T9.html Planck 2015 results, table 9]&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinary ("[[baryonic matter|baryonic]]") matter is therefore only 4.9% [2015] of the physical universe.&lt;ref name="planck_2015" /&gt; Stars, planets, and visible gas clouds only form about 6% of ordinary matter, or about 0.3% of the entire universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

There are many competing hypotheses about the [[ultimate fate of the universe]] and about what, if anything, preceded the Big Bang, while other physicists and philosophers refuse to speculate, doubting that information about prior states will ever be accessible.

== Etymology ==
The word ''universe'' derives from the [[Old French]] word ''univers'', which in turn derives from the [[Latin]] word ''universum''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary'', volume II, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1971, p. 3518.&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin word was used by [[Cicero]] and later Latin authors in many of the same senses as the modern [[English language|English]] word is used.&lt;ref name="lewis_short"&gt;Lewis, C.T. and Short, S (1879) ''A Latin Dictionary'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-864201-6}}, pp. 1933, 1977–1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Synonyms ===
A term for "universe" among the ancient Greek philosophers from [[Pythagoras]] onwards was {{lang|grc|τὸ πᾶν}}, ''tò pân'' ("the all"), defined as all matter and all space, and {{lang|grc|τὸ ὅλον}}, ''tò hólon'' ("all things"), which did not necessarily include the void.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author1=Liddell | author2=Scott | title=A Greek-English Lexicon | quote=πᾶς | url = http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/πᾶς}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author1=Liddell | author2=Scott | title=A Greek-English Lexicon | quote=ὅλος | url = http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/ὅλος}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another synonym was {{lang|grc|ὁ κόσμος}}, ''ho kósmos'' (meaning the [[world (philosophy)|world]], the [[cosmos]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author1=Liddell | author2=Scott |title = A Greek–English Lexicon | quote = κόσμος | url = http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/κόσμος}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synonyms are also found in Latin authors (''totum'', ''mundus'', ''natura'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lewis, C.T. | author2=Short, S | date=1879 | title=A Latin Dictionary | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-864201-5 | pages=1175, 1189–90, 1881–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; and survive in modern languages, e.g., the German words ''Das All'', ''Weltall'', and ''Natur'' for ''Universe''. The same synonyms are found in English, such as everything (as in the [[theory of everything]]), the cosmos (as in [[cosmology]]), the world (as in the [[many-worlds interpretation]]), and [[nature]] (as in [[natural law]]s or [[natural philosophy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary | volume=II | isbn= 978-0-19-861117-2 | publisher=Oxford: Oxford University Press | date=1971 | pages=569, 909, 1900, 3821–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chronology and the Big Bang ==
{{Main|Big Bang|Chronology of the universe}}
{{Nature timeline}}
The prevailing model for the evolution of the Universe is the Big Bang theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Silk|title=Horizons of Cosmology|publisher=Templeton Pressr|date=2009|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Simon Singh|title=Big Bang: The Origin of the Universe|publisher=Harper Perennial|date=2005|page=560}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Big Bang model states that the earliest state of the Universe was an extremely hot and dense one, and that the Universe subsequently expanded and cooled. The model is based on [[general relativity]] and on simplifying assumptions such as [[homogeneity (physics)#Translation invariance|homogeneity]] and [[isotropy]] of space. A version of the model with a [[cosmological constant]] (Lambda) and [[cold dark matter]], known as the [[Lambda-CDM model]], is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of various observations about the Universe. The Big Bang model accounts for observations such as the correlation of distance and [[redshift]] of galaxies, the ratio of the number of hydrogen to helium atoms, and the microwave radiation background.

The initial hot, dense state is called the [[Planck epoch]], a brief period extending from time zero to one [[Planck time]] unit of approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds. During the Planck epoch, all types of matter and all types of energy were concentrated into a dense state, and [[gravity]] - currently the weakest by far of the [[fundamental interactions|four known forces]] - is believed to have been as strong as the other fundamental forces, and all the forces may have been [[grand unification|unified]]. Since the Planck epoch, space has been [[metric expansion of space|expanding]] to its present scale, with a very short but intense period of [[cosmic inflation]] believed to have occurred within the first [[Scientific Notation|10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt;]] seconds.&lt;ref name=Sivaram&gt;{{cite journal | author=C. Sivaram | journal=Astrophysics and Space Science | date=1986 | volume=125 | issue=1 | pages=189–99 | doi=10.1007/BF00643984 | bibcode=1986Ap&amp;SS.125..189S | title= Evolution of the Universe through the Planck epoch}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a kind of expansion different from those we can see around us today. Objects in space did not physically move; instead the [[metric expansion of space|metric]] that defines space itself changed. Although objects in [[spacetime]] cannot move faster than the [[speed of light]], this limitation does not apply to the metric governing spacetime itself. This initial period of inflation is believed to explain why space appears to be very flat, and much larger than light could travel since the start of the universe.

Within the first fraction of a second of the universe's existence, the four fundamental forces had separated. As the universe continued to cool down from its inconceivably hot state, various types of [[subatomic particles]] were able to form in short periods of time known as the [[quark epoch]], the [[hadron epoch]], and the [[lepton epoch]]. Together, these epochs encompassed less than 10 seconds of time following the Big Bang. These [[elementary particle]]s associated stably into ever larger combinations, including stable [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, which then formed more complex [[atomic nuclei]] through [[nuclear fusion]]. This process, known as [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]], only lasted for about 17 minutes and ended about 20 minutes after the Big Bang, so only the fastest and simplest reactions occurred. About 25% of the [[proton]]s and all the [[neutron]]s in the universe, by mass, were converted to [[helium]], with small amounts of [[deuterium]] (a [[isotope|form]] of [[hydrogen]]) and traces of [[lithium]]. Any other [[chemical element|element]] was only formed in very tiny quantities. The other 75% of the protons remained unaffected, as [[hydrogen]] nuclei.

After nucleosynthesis ended, the universe entered a period known as the [[photon epoch]]. During this period, the Universe was still far too hot for matter to form neutral [[atom]]s, so it contained a hot, dense, foggy [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] of negatively charged [[electron]]s, neutral [[neutrino]]s and positive nuclei. After about 377,000 years, the universe had cooled enough that electrons and nuclei could form the first stable [[atom]]s. This is known as [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] for historical reasons; in fact electrons and nuclei were combining for the first time. Unlike plasma, neutral atoms are [[Opacity (optics)|transparent]] to many [[wavelength]]s of light, so for the first time the universe also became transparent. The photons released ("[[photon decoupling|decoupled]]") when these atoms formed can still be seen today; they form the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB).

As the Universe expands, the [[energy density]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] decreases more quickly than does that of [[matter]] because the energy of a photon decreases with its wavelength. At around 47,000 years, the [[energy density]] of matter became larger than that of photons and [[neutrino]]s, and began to dominate the large scale behavior of the universe. This marked the end of the [[radiation-dominated era]] and the start of the [[matter-dominated era]].

In the earliest stages of the universe, tiny fluctuations within the universe's density led to [[filament (cosmology)|concentrations]] of [[dark matter]] gradually forming. Ordinary matter, attracted to these by [[gravity]], formed large gas clouds and eventually, stars and galaxies, where the dark matter was most dense, and [[Void (astronomy)|voids]] where it was least dense. After around 100 - 300 million years,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} the first [[star]]s formed, known as [[Population III]] stars. These were probably very massive, luminous, [[metallicity|non metallic]] and short-lived. They were responsible for the gradual [[reionization]] of the Universe between about 200-500 million years and 1 billion years, and also for seeding the universe with elements heavier than helium, through [[stellar nucleosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=Scientific American | title= The First Stars in the Universe |author1=Richard B. Larson  |author2=Volker Bromm  |lastauthoramp=yes | date=March 2002 | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-first-stars-in-the-un/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Universe also contains a mysterious energy - possibly a [[scalar field]] - called [[dark energy]], the density of which does not change over time. After about 9.8 billion years, the Universe had expanded sufficiently so that the density of matter was less than the density of dark energy, marking the beginning of the present [[dark-energy-dominated era]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryden, Barbara, "Introduction to Cosmology", 2006, eqn. 6.33&lt;/ref&gt; In this era, the expansion of the Universe is [[accelerating expansion of the universe|accelerating]] due to dark energy.

Of the four [[fundamental interaction]]s, [[gravitation]] is the dominant at astronomical length scales. Gravity's effects are cumulative; by contrast, the effects of positive and negative charges tend to cancel one another, making electromagnetism relatively insignificant on astronomical length scales. The remaining two interactions, the [[weak nuclear force|weak]] and [[strong nuclear force]]s, decline very rapidly with distance; their effects are confined mainly to sub-atomic length scales.

The Universe appears to have much more [[matter]] than [[antimatter]], an asymmetry possibly related to the [[CP violation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=October 28, 2003 |url=http://www.pparc.ac.uk/Ps/bbs/bbs_antimatter.asp |title=Antimatter |publisher=Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council |accessdate=August 10, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040307075727/http://www.pparc.ac.uk/Ps/bbs/bbs_antimatter.asp |archivedate=March 7, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This imbalance between matter and antimatter is partially responsible for the existence of all matter existing today, since matter and antimatter, if equally produced at the [[Big Bang]], would have completely annihilated each other and left only [[photon]]s as a result of their interaction.&lt;ref name="TT-20171025"&gt;{{cite web |last=Adamson |first=Allan |title=Universe Should Not Actually Exist: Big Bang Produced Equal Amounts Of Matter And Antimatter |url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/214821/20171025/universe-should-not-actually-exist-big-bang-produced-equal-amounts-of-matter-and-antimatter.htm |date=19 October 2017 |work=TechTimes.com |accessdate=26 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAT-20171020"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smorra C. |display-authors=et al |title=A parts-per-billion measurement of the antiproton magnetic moment |date=20 October 2017 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=550 |issue=7676 |pages=371–74 |doi=10.1038/nature24048 |pmid=29052625 |bibcode=2017Natur.550..371S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Universe also appears to have neither net [[momentum]] nor [[angular momentum]], which follows accepted physical laws if the Universe is finite.

Namely, every closed surface in a finite space encloses on each side of itself a finite region of space. Therefore the flux of the electric field through this surface is equal, on th eone hand, to the total charge located in the interior of the surface, and on the other hand to the total charge outside of it, with opposite sign. Consequently, the sum of the charges on the two sides of the surface is zero."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Size and regions ===
{{See also|Observable universe|Observational cosmology}}
The size of the Universe is somewhat difficult to define. According to the general theory of relativity, far regions of [[space]] may never interact with ours even in the lifetime of the Universe due to the finite [[speed of light]] and the ongoing [[expansion of space]]. For example, radio messages sent from Earth may never reach some regions of space, even if the Universe were to exist forever: space may expand faster than light can traverse it.&lt;ref name="Kaku2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michio Kaku|title=Physics of the Impossible: A Scientific Exploration into the World of Phasers, Force Fields, Teleportation, and Time Travel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ube-MQcFFZQC&amp;pg=PA202|date=March 11, 2008|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-385-52544-2|pages=202–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distant regions of space are assumed to exist and to be part of reality as much as we are, even though we can never interact with them. The spatial region that we can affect and be affected by is the [[observable universe]]. The observable universe depends on the location of the observer. By traveling, an observer can come into contact with a greater region of spacetime than an observer who remains still. Nevertheless, even the most rapid traveler will not be able to interact with all of space. Typically, the observable universe is taken to mean the portion of the Universe that is observable from our vantage point in the Milky Way.&lt;!-- [[Hubble's law]] links to this section --&gt;

Astronomers calculate the [[age of the Universe]] by assuming that the [[Lambda-CDM model]] accurately describes the evolution of the Universe from a very uniform, hot, dense primordial state to its present state and measuring the cosmological parameters which constitute the model.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} This model is well understood theoretically and supported by recent high-precision [[astronomical observation]]s such as [[WMAP]] and [[Planck (satellite)|Planck]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Commonly, the set of observations fitted includes the [[cosmic microwave background]] anisotropy, the brightness/redshift relation for [[Type Ia supernovae]], and large-scale galaxy clustering including the [[baryon acoustic oscillation]] feature.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Other observations, such as the Hubble constant, the abundance of galaxy clusters, [[weak gravitational lensing]] and globular cluster ages, are generally consistent with these, providing a check of the model, but are less accurately measured at present.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Assuming that the Lambda-CDM model is correct, the measurements of the parameters using a variety of techniques by numerous experiments yield a best value of the age of the Universe as of 2015 of 13.799 [[Measurement uncertainty|±]] 0.021 billion years.&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"/&gt;

Due to this expansion, scientists on Earth can observe the light from a galaxy 30 billion light-years away even though that light has traveled for only 13 billion years; the very space between them has expanded. This expansion is consistent with the observation that the light from distant galaxies has been [[redshift]]ed; the [[photon]]s emitted have been stretched to longer [[wavelength]]s and lower [[frequency]] during their journey.

The more matter there is in the Universe, the stronger the mutual [[gravitational]] pull of the matter. If the Universe were ''too'' dense then it would re-collapse into a [[gravitational singularity]]. However, if the Universe contained too ''little'' matter then the self-gravity would be too weak for astronomical structures, like galaxies or planets, to form. Since the Big Bang, the universe has expanded [[monotonic]]ally. [[Anthropic principle#Anthropic coincidences|Perhaps unsurprisingly]], our universe has [[Critical Mass Density of the Universe|just the right mass-energy density]], equivalent to about 5 protons per cubic meter, which has allowed it to expand for the last 13.8 billion years, giving time to form the universe as observed today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode | author1=[[Sean Carroll (physicist)|Sean Carroll]] |author2=[[Michio Kaku]] | series=How the Universe Works | title=End of the Universe | date=2014 | network=Discovery Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are dynamical forces acting on the particles in the Universe which affect the expansion rate. Before 1998, it was expected that the expansion rate would be decreasing as time went on due to the influence of gravitational interactions in the Universe; and thus there is an additional observable quantity in the Universe called the [[deceleration parameter]], which most cosmologists expected to be positive and related to the matter density of the Universe. In 1998, the deceleration parameter was measured by two different groups to be negative, approximately -0.55, which technically implies that the second derivative of the cosmic [[scale factor cosmology|scale factor]] &lt;math&gt; \ddot{a}&lt;/math&gt; has been positive in the last 5-6 billion years.&lt;ref name="nobel_2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Overbye|first=Dennis|title=A 'Cosmic Jerk' That Reversed the Universe|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/11/us/a-cosmic-jerk-that-reversed-the-universe.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 11, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This acceleration does not, however, imply that the Hubble parameter is currently increasing; see [[deceleration parameter]] for details.

=== Spacetime ===
{{Main|Spacetime|World line}}
{{See also|Lorentz transformation}}
Spacetimes are the arenas in which all physical events take place. The basic elements of spacetimes are [[event (relativity)|events]]. In any given spacetime, an event is defined as a unique position at a unique time. A spacetime is the union of all events (in the same way that a line is the union of all of its points), formally organized into a [[manifold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The Universe appears to be a smooth spacetime continuum consisting of three [[space|spatial]] [[dimension]]s and one temporal ([[time]]) dimension (an event in the spacetime of the physical Universe can therefore be identified by a set of four coordinates: {{nowrap begin}}(''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ''t''){{nowrap end}} ). On the average, [[3-space|space]] is observed to be very nearly [[Shape of the universe|flat]] (with a [[curvature]] close to zero), meaning that [[Euclidean geometry]] is empirically true with high accuracy throughout most of the Universe.&lt;ref name="Shape"&gt;[http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_mm/mr_content.html WMAP Mission: Results&amp;nbsp;– Age of the Universe]. Map.gsfc.nasa.gov. Retrieved November 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Spacetime also appears to have a [[simply connected space|simply connected]] [[topology]], in analogy with a sphere, at least on the length-scale of the observable Universe. However, present observations cannot exclude the possibilities that the Universe has more dimensions (which is postulated by theories such as the [[String theory]]) and that its spacetime may have a multiply connected global topology, in analogy with the cylindrical or [[toroid]]al topologies of two-dimensional [[space]]s.&lt;ref name="Nat03"&gt;{{cite journal

The spacetime of the Universe is usually interpreted from a [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] perspective, with space as consisting of [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]], and time as consisting of [[one dimension]], the "[[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/s10714-006-0254-9 | bibcode=2006GReGr..38..643B | arxiv=gr-qc/0407022 | title=Spacetime and Euclidean geometry | journal= General Relativity and Gravitation | volume=38 | issue=4 | year=2006 | pages=643–51 | last1=Brill | first1=Dieter | last2=Jacobsen | first2=Ted| citeseerx=10.1.1.338.7953 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By combining space and time into a single [[manifold]] called [[Minkowski space]], physicists have simplified a large number of [[Theoretical physics|physical theories]], as well as described in a more uniform way the workings of the Universe at both the [[Physical cosmology|supergalactic]] and [[quantum mechanics|subatomic]] levels.

Spacetime [[event (relativity)|events]] are not absolutely defined spatially and temporally but rather are known to be relative to the motion of an [[observer (special relativity)|observer]]. Minkowski space approximates the Universe without [[gravity]]; the [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s of [[general relativity]] describe spacetime with matter and gravity.

=== Shape ===
{{Main|Shape of the universe}}
[[File:End of universe.jpg|thumb|The three possible options for the shape of the Universe]]

General relativity describes how spacetime is curved and bent by mass and energy (gravity). The [[topology]] or [[geometry]] of the Universe includes both [[Shape of the universe#Local geometry (spatial curvature)|local geometry]] in the [[observable universe]] and [[Shape of the universe#Global geometry|global geometry]].
Cosmologists often work with a given [[space-like]] slice of spacetime called the [[Comoving distance|comoving coordinates]]. The section of spacetime which can be observed is the backward [[light cone]], which delimits the [[cosmological horizon]].
The cosmological horizon (also called the particle horizon or the light horizon) is the maximum distance from which [[Elementary particle|particles]] can have traveled to the [[observation|observer]] in the [[age of the Universe]]. This horizon represents the boundary between the observable and the unobservable regions of the Universe.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Robert Harrison|title=Cosmology: the science of the universe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kNxeHD2cbLYC&amp;pg=PA447|accessdate=May 1, 2011|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-66148-5|pages=447–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew R.

An important parameter determining the future evolution of the Universe theory is the [[density parameter]], Omega (Ω), defined as the average matter density of the universe divided by a critical value of that density. This selects one of three possible [[Shape of the universe|geometries]] depending on whether Ω is equal to, less than, or greater than 1. These are called, respectively, the flat, open and closed universes.&lt;ref name=FateOfTheUniverse&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Ultimate Fate of the Universe?|url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_fate.html|website=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|publisher=NASA|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observations, including the [[Cosmic Background Explorer]] (COBE), [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP), and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] maps of the CMB, suggest that the Universe is infinite in extent with a finite age, as described by the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker]] (FLRW) models.&lt;ref name="nasa_popular_uni_curv"&gt;[http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_shape.html Will the Universe expand forever?], WMAP website at NASA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nat03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RBSG08"&gt;{{cite journal|last =Roukema|first =Boudewijn|author2=Zbigniew Buliński |author3=Agnieszka Szaniewska |author4=Nicolas E.

=== Support of life ===
{{main|Fine-tuned Universe}}
The Universe may be ''fine-tuned''; the Fine-tuned Universe hypothesis is the proposition that the conditions that allow the existence of observable [[life]] in the Universe can only occur when certain universal [[physical constant|fundamental physical constants]] lie within a very narrow range of values, so that if any of several fundamental constants were only slightly different, the Universe would have been unlikely to be conducive to the establishment and development of [[matter]], astronomical structures, elemental diversity, or life as it is understood.&lt;ref name=toa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CI/CI301.html |title=CI301: The Anthropic Principle |accessdate=October 31, 2007 |editor=Mark Isaak |date=2005 |work=Index to Creationist Claims |publisher=[[TalkOrigins Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposition is discussed among [[philosophy|philosophers]], [[science|scientists]], [[theology|theologians]], and proponents of [[creationism]].

An explanation for why the expansion of the Universe is accelerating remains elusive.

Contributions from scalar fields that are constant in space are usually also included in the cosmological constant. The cosmological constant can be formulated to be equivalent to [[vacuum energy]]. Scalar fields having only a slight amount of spatial inhomogeneity would be difficult to distinguish from a cosmological constant.

=== Dark matter ===
{{main|Dark matter}}
Dark matter is a hypothetical kind of [[matter]] that is invisible to the entire [[electromagnetic spectrum]], but which accounts for most of the matter in the Universe. The existence and properties of dark matter are inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the [[Observable universe#Large-scale structure|large-scale structure]] of the Universe. Other than [[neutrinos]], a form of [[hot dark matter]], dark matter has not been detected directly, making it one of the greatest mysteries in modern [[astrophysics]]. Dark matter neither [[blackbody spectrum|emits]] nor absorbs light or any other [[electromagnetic radiation]] at any significant level. Dark matter is estimated to constitute 26.8% of the total mass–energy and 84.5% &lt;!--26.8/(4.9 + 26.8)--&gt; of the total matter in the Universe.&lt;ref name = DarkMatter&gt;Sean Carroll, Ph.D., Caltech, 2007, The Teaching Company, ''Dark Matter, Dark Energy: The Dark Side of the Universe'', Guidebook Part 2 p. 46, Accessed October 7, 2013, "...dark matter: An invisible, essentially collisionless component of matter that makes up about 25 percent of the energy density of the universe... it's a different kind of particle... something not yet observed in the laboratory..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=planckcam&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/planck-captures-portrait-of-the-young-universe-revealing-earliest-light |title=Planck captures portrait of the young Universe, revealing earliest light |date=March 21, 2013 |publisher=University of Cambridge |accessdate=March 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ordinary Matter ===
{{main|Matter}}
The remaining 4.9% of the mass–energy of the Universe is ordinary matter, that is, [[atom]]s, [[ion]]s, [[electron]]s and the objects they form. This matter includes [[star]]s, which produce nearly all of the light we see from galaxies, as well as interstellar gas in the [[interstellar medium|interstellar]] and [[intergalactic medium|intergalactic]] media, [[planet]]s, and all the objects from everyday life that we can bump into, touch or squeeze.&lt;ref name=Davies2&gt;

Ordinary matter commonly exists in four [[state of matter|states]] (or [[phase (matter)|phases]]): [[solid]], [[liquid]], [[gas]], and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. However, advances in experimental techniques have revealed other previously theoretical phases, such as [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s and [[fermionic condensate]]s.

Ordinary matter is composed of two types of [[elementary particle]]s: [[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s.&lt;ref name=Hooft&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the proton is formed of two [[up quarks]] and one [[down quark]]; the neutron is formed of two down quarks and one up quark; and the electron is a kind of lepton. An atom consists of an [[atomic nucleus]], made up of protons and neutrons, and electrons that orbit the nucleus. Because most of the mass of an atom is concentrated in its nucleus, which is made up of [[baryons]], astronomers often use the term ''baryonic matter'' to describe ordinary matter, although a small fraction of this "baryonic matter" is electrons.

Soon after the [[Big Bang]], primordial protons and neutrons formed from the [[quark–gluon plasma]] of the early Universe as it cooled below two trillion degrees. A few minutes later, in a process known as [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]], nuclei formed from the primordial protons and neutrons. This nucleosynthesis formed lighter elements, those with small atomic numbers up to [[lithium]] and [[beryllium]], but the abundance of heavier elements dropped off sharply with increasing atomic number. Some [[boron]] may have been formed at this time, but the next heavier element, [[carbon]], was not formed in significant amounts. Big Bang nucleosynthesis shut down after about 20 minutes due to the rapid drop in temperature and density of the expanding Universe. Subsequent formation of [[metallicity|heavier elements]] resulted from [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] and [[supernova nucleosynthesis]].&lt;ref name=Clayton1983&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clayton|first1=Donald D.|title=Principles of Stellar Evolution and Nucleosynthesis|date=1983|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-10953-4|pages=362–435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hadrons ====
{{Main|Hadron}}
A hadron is a [[composite particle]] made of [[quark]]s [[bound state|held together]] by the [[strong force]]. Hadrons are categorized into two families: [[baryon]]s (such as [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s) made of three quarks, and [[meson]]s (such as [[pion]]s) made of one quark and one [[antiparticle|antiquark]]. Of the hadrons, protons are stable, and neutrons bound within atomic nuclei are stable. Other hadrons are unstable under ordinary conditions and are thus insignificant constituents of the modern Universe.
From approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the [[Big Bang]], during a period is known as the [[hadron epoch]], the temperature of the universe had fallen sufficiently to allow quarks to bind together into hadrons, and the mass of the Universe was dominated by [[hadron]]s. Initially the temperature was high enough to allow the formation of hadron/anti-hadron pairs, which kept matter and antimatter in [[thermal equilibrium]]. However, as the temperature of the Universe continued to fall, hadron/anti-hadron pairs were no longer produced. Most of the hadrons and anti-hadrons were then eliminated in particle-antiparticle [[annihilation]] reactions, leaving a small residual of hadrons by the time the Universe was about one second old.&lt;ref name=Allday2002&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allday|first1=Jonathan|title=Quarks, Leptons and the Big Bang|date=2002|publisher=IOP Publishing|isbn=978-0-7503-0806-9|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|244–66}}

==== Leptons ====
{{main|Lepton}}
A lepton is an [[elementary particle|elementary]], [[half-integer spin]] particle that does not undergo strong interactions but is subject to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]; no two leptons of the same species can be in exactly the same state at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;

Electrons are stable and the most common charged lepton in the Universe, whereas [[muon]]s and [[tau (particle)|taus]] are unstable particle that quickly decay after being produced in [[high energy physics|high energy]] collisions, such as those involving [[cosmic ray]]s or carried out in [[particle accelerator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[lepton epoch]] was the period in the evolution of the early Universe in which the [[lepton]]s dominated the mass of the Universe. It started roughly 1 second after the [[Big Bang]], after the majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilated each other at the end of the [[hadron epoch]]. During the lepton epoch the temperature of the Universe was still high enough to create lepton/anti-lepton pairs, so leptons and anti-leptons were in thermal equilibrium. Approximately 10 seconds after the Big Bang, the temperature of the Universe had fallen to the point where lepton/anti-lepton pairs were no longer created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thermal history of the Universe and early growth of density fluctuations|url=http://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~gamk/TUM_Lectures/Lecture4.pdf|work=Guinevere Kauffmann|publisher=[[Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics]]|accessdate=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most leptons and anti-leptons were then eliminated in [[annihilation]] reactions, leaving a small residue of leptons.

==== Photons ====
{{Main|Photon epoch}}
{{See also|Photino}}
A photon is the [[quantum]] of [[light]] and all other forms of [[electromagnetic radiation]]. It is the [[force carrier]] for the [[electromagnetic force]], even when [[Static forces and virtual-particle exchange|static]] via [[virtual photons]]. The effects of this [[force]] are easily observable at the [[microscopic scale|microscopic]] and at the [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] level because the photon has zero [[rest mass]]; this allows long distance [[fundamental interaction|interactions]]. Like all elementary particles, photons are currently best explained by [[quantum mechanics]] and exhibit [[wave–particle duality]], exhibiting properties of [[wave]]s and of [[wikt:particle|particles]].

The photon epoch started after most leptons and anti-leptons were [[annihilation|annihilated]] at the end of the lepton epoch, about 10 seconds after the Big Bang. Atomic nuclei were created in the process of nucleosynthesis which occurred during the first few minutes of the photon epoch. For the remainder of the photon epoch the Universe contained a hot dense [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of nuclei, electrons and photons. About 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the temperature of the Universe fell to the point where nuclei could combine with electrons to create neutral atoms. As a result, photons no longer interacted frequently with matter and the Universe became transparent. The highly redshifted photons from this period form the cosmic microwave background. Tiny variations in temperature and density detectable in the CMB were the early "seeds" from which all subsequent [[structure formation]] took place.&lt;ref name=Allday2002/&gt;{{rp|244–66}}

== Cosmological models ==
=== Model of the Universe based on general relativity ===
{{main|Solutions of the Einstein field equations}}
{{See also|Big Bang|Ultimate fate of the Universe}}
[[General relativity]] is the [[Differential geometry|geometric]] [[Theoretical physics|theory]] of [[gravitation]] published by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1915 and the current description of gravitation in [[modern physics]]. It is the basis of current [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] models of the Universe. General relativity generalizes [[special relativity]] and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of [[space]] and [[Time in physics|time]], or spacetime. In particular, the [[curvature]] of spacetime is directly related to the [[energy]] and [[momentum]] of whatever [[matter]] and [[radiation]] are present. The relation is specified by the [[Einstein field equations]], a system of [[partial differential equation]]s. In general relativity, the distribution of matter and energy determines the geometry of spacetime, which in turn describes the [[acceleration]] of matter. Therefore, solutions of the Einstein field equations describe the evolution of the Universe. Combined with measurements of the amount, type, and distribution of matter in the Universe, the equations of general relativity describe the evolution of the Universe over time.&lt;ref name="zeilik_cosmology" /&gt;

With the assumption of the [[cosmological principle]] that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic everywhere, a specific solution of the field equations that describes the Universe is the [[metric tensor]] called the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]],
:&lt;math&gt;
ds^2 = -c^{2} dt^2 +
R(t)^2 \left( \frac{dr^2}{1-k r^2} + r^2 d\theta^2 + r^2 \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2 \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
where (''r'', θ, φ) correspond to a [[spherical coordinate system]]. This [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] has only two undetermined parameters. An overall [[dimensionless]] length [[scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] ''R'' describes the size scale of the Universe as a function of time; an increase in ''R'' is the [[expansion of the Universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A curvature index ''k'' describes the geometry. The index ''k'' is defined so that it can take only one of three values: 0, corresponding to flat [[Euclidean geometry]]; 1, corresponding to a space of positive [[curvature]]; or −1, corresponding to a space of positive or negative curvature.&lt;ref name="RaineThomas66" /&gt; The value of ''R'' as a function of time ''t'' depends upon ''k'' and the [[cosmological constant]] ''Λ''.&lt;ref name="zeilik_cosmology"&gt;{{cite book |title=Introductory Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |last1=Zeilik |first1=Michael |last2=Gregory |first2=Stephen A. |date=1998 |edition=4th |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-006228-5 | section=25-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cosmological constant represents the energy density of the vacuum of space and could be related to dark energy.&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt; The equation describing how ''R'' varies with time is known as the [[Friedmann equation]] after its inventor, [[Alexander Friedmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Friedmann A.|date = 1922|title = Über die Krümmung des Raumes|journal = Zeitschrift für Physik|volume = 10|issue = 1|pages = 377–86|doi = 10.1007/BF01332580|bibcode = 1922ZPhy...10..377F|authorlink = Alexander Friedmann|url=http://publikationen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/files/16735/E001554876.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The solutions for ''R(t)'' depend on ''k'' and ''Λ'', but some qualitative features of such solutions are general. First and most importantly, the length scale ''R'' of the Universe can remain constant ''only'' if the Universe is perfectly isotropic with positive curvature (''k''=1) and has one precise value of density everywhere, as first noted by [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref name="zeilik_cosmology" /&gt; However, this equilibrium is unstable: because the Universe is known to be inhomogeneous on smaller scales, ''R'' must change over time. When ''R'' changes, all the spatial distances in the Universe change in tandem; there is an overall expansion or contraction of space itself. This accounts for the observation that galaxies appear to be flying apart; the space between them is stretching. The stretching of space also accounts for the apparent paradox that two galaxies can be 40 billion light-years apart, although they started from the same point 13.8 billion years ago&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; and never moved faster than the [[speed of light]].

Second, all solutions suggest that there was a [[gravitational singularity]] in the past, when ''R'' went to zero and matter and energy were infinitely dense. It may seem that this conclusion is uncertain because it is based on the questionable assumptions of perfect homogeneity and isotropy (the cosmological principle) and that only the gravitational interaction is significant. However, the [[Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems]] show that a singularity should exist for very general conditions. Hence, according to Einstein's field equations, ''R'' grew rapidly from an unimaginably hot, dense state that existed immediately following this singularity (when ''R'' had a small, finite value); this is the essence of the [[Big Bang]] model of the Universe. Understanding the singularity of the Big Bang likely requires a [[quantum theory of gravity]], which has not yet been formulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|pp=122–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third, the curvature index ''k'' determines the sign of the mean spatial curvature of spacetime&lt;ref name="RaineThomas66"&gt;{{harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; averaged over sufficiently large length scales (greater than about a billion [[light-year]]s). If ''k''=1, the curvature is positive and the Universe has a finite volume.&lt;ref name="RaineThomas70" /&gt; A Universe with positive curvature is often visualized as a [[3-sphere|three-dimensional sphere]] embedded in a four-dimensional space. Conversely, if ''k'' is zero or negative, the Universe has an infinite volume.&lt;ref name="RaineThomas70"&gt;{{harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may seem counter-intuitive that an infinite and yet infinitely dense Universe could be created in a single instant at the Big Bang when ''R''=0, but exactly that is predicted mathematically when ''k'' does not equal 1. By analogy, an infinite plane has zero curvature but infinite area, whereas an infinite cylinder is finite in one direction and a [[torus]] is finite in both. A toroidal Universe could behave like a normal Universe with [[periodic boundary conditions]].

The [[ultimate fate of the Universe]] is still unknown, because it depends critically on the curvature index ''k'' and the cosmological constant ''Λ''.

Some speculative theories have proposed that our Universe is but one of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of disconnected universes, collectively denoted as the [[multiverse]], challenging or enhancing more limited definitions of the Universe.&lt;ref name="EllisKS032"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Munitz MK|date = 1959|title = One Universe or Many?|journal = Journal of the History of Ideas|volume = 12|pages = 231–55|doi = 10.2307/2707516|issue = 2|jstor = 2707516}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific multiverse models are distinct from concepts such as [[plane (esotericism)|alternate planes of consciousness]] and [[simulated reality]].

[[Max Tegmark]] developed a four-part [[Multiverse#Max Tegmark's four levels|classification scheme]] for the different types of multiverses that scientists have suggested in response to various [[Physics]] problems. An example of such multiverses is the one resulting from the [[bubble universe theory|chaotic inflation]] model of the early universe.&lt;ref name="chaotic_inflation"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Linde A.|date = 1986|title = Eternal chaotic inflation|journal = Mod.

In this interpretation, parallel worlds are generated in a manner similar to [[quantum superposition]] and [[decoherence]], with all states of the [[wave function]]s being realized in separate worlds. Effectively, in the many-worlds interpretation the multiverse evolves as a [[universal wavefunction]]. If the Big Bang that created our multiverse created an ensemble of multiverses, the wave function of the ensemble would be entangled in this sense.&lt;ref name=everett1957&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Everett | first1 = Hugh | authorlink = Hugh Everett | year = 1957 | title = Relative State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume = 29 | issue = 3| pages = 454–62 |bibcode = 1957RvMP...29..454E |doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.29.454 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The least controversial category of multiverse in Tegmark's scheme is [[Multiverse#Level I: An extension of our Universe|Level I]]. The multiverses of this level are composed by distant spacetime events "in our own universe". If space is infinite, or sufficiently large and uniform, identical instances of the history of Earth's entire [[Hubble volume]] occur every so often, simply by chance. Tegmark calculated that our nearest so-called [[doppelgänger]], is 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;115&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; meters away from us (a [[double exponential function]] larger than a [[googolplex]]).&lt;ref name="TegmarkPUstaple"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12701329|title=Parallel universes.

== Historical conceptions ==
{{See also|Cosmology|Timeline of cosmological theories|Nicolaus Copernicus#Copernican system|Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica#Beginnings of the Scientific Revolution}}
Historically, there have been many ideas of the cosmos (cosmologies) and its origin (cosmogonies). Theories of an impersonal Universe governed by physical laws were first proposed by the Greeks and Indians.&lt;ref name=Routledge/&gt; Ancient Chinese philosophy encompassed the notion of the Universe including both all of space and all of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Gernet|first = J.|date = 1993–1994|title=Space and time: Science and religion in the encounter between China and Europe|journal=Chinese Science|volume=11|pages=93–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Ng|first=Tai|title=Chinese Culture, Western Culture: Why Must We Learn from Each Other?|chapter=III.3|publisher=iUniverse, Inc.|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries, improvements in astronomical observations and theories of motion and gravitation led to ever more accurate descriptions of the Universe. The modern era of cosmology began with [[Albert Einstein]]'s 1915 [[general relativity|general theory of relativity]], which made it possible to quantitatively predict the origin, evolution, and conclusion of the Universe as a whole. Most modern, accepted theories of cosmology are based on general relativity and, more specifically, the predicted [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref name="Blandford"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A century of general relativity: Astrophysics and cosmology|author=Blandford R.

=== Mythologies ===
{{Main|Creation myth|Creator deity|Religious cosmology}}
Many cultures have [[List of creation myths|stories describing the origin of the world and universe]]. Cultures generally regard these stories as having some [[truth]]. There are however many differing beliefs in how these stories apply amongst those believing in a supernatural origin, ranging from a god directly creating the Universe as it is now to a god just setting the "wheels in motion" (for example via mechanisms such as the big bang and evolution).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | quote="In common usage the word 'myth' refers to narratives or beliefs that are untrue or merely fanciful; the stories that make up national or ethnic mythologies describe characters and events that common sense and experience tell us are impossible.

Ethnologists and anthropologists who study myths have developed various classification schemes for the various themes that appear in creation stories.&lt;ref name=Eliade1964&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eliade|first1=Mircea|title=Myth and Reality (Religious Traditions of the World)|date=1964|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|isbn=978-0-04-291001-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leonard2004&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leonard|first1=Scott A.|last2=McClure|first2=Michael|title=Myth and Knowing: An Introduction to World Mythology|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-7674-1957-4|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in one type of story, the world is born from a [[world egg]]; such stories include the [[Finnish people|Finnish]] [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Kalevala]]'', the [[China|Chinese]] story of [[Pangu]] or the [[History of India|Indian]] [[Brahmanda Purana]]. In related stories, the Universe is created by a single entity emanating or producing something by him- or herself, as in the [[Tibetan Buddhism]] concept of [[Adi-Buddha]], the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] story of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] (Mother Earth), the [[Aztec mythology|Aztec]] goddess [[Coatlicue]] myth, the [[ancient Egyptian religion|ancient Egyptian]] [[Ennead|god]] [[Atum]] story, and the [[Judeo-Christian]] [[Genesis creation narrative]] in which the [[God in Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic God]] created the Universe. In another type of story, the Universe is created from the union of male and female deities, as in the [[Maori mythology|Maori story]] of [[Rangi and Papa]]. In other stories, the Universe is created by crafting it from pre-existing materials, such as the corpse of a dead god&amp;nbsp;— as from [[Tiamat]] in the [[Babylon]]ian epic ''[[Enuma Elish]]'' or from the giant [[Ymir]] in [[Norse mythology]]&amp;nbsp;– or from chaotic materials, as in [[Izanagi]] and [[Izanami]] in [[Japanese mythology]]. In other stories, the Universe emanates from fundamental principles, such as [[Brahman]] and [[Prakrti]], the [[Serer creation myth|creation myth]] of the [[Serer people|Serers]],&lt;ref&gt;([[Henry Gravrand]], "La civilisation Sereer -Pangool") [in] [[Universität Frankfurt am Main]], Frobenius-Institut, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Kulturmorphologie, Frobenius Gesellschaft, "Paideuma: Mitteilungen zur Kulturkunde, Volumes 43–44", F.

=== Philosophical models ===
{{Further|Cosmology}}
{{See also|Pre-Socratic philosophy|Physics (Aristotle)|Hindu cosmology|Islamic cosmology|Philosophy of space and time}}
The [[pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic Greek philosophers]] and Indian philosophers developed some of the earliest philosophical concepts of the Universe.&lt;ref name=Routledge/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Unfinished Universe|page=21|publisher=Oxford University Press|first=Louise|last=B. Young}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Greek philosophers noted that appearances can be deceiving, and sought to understand the underlying reality behind the appearances. In particular, they noted the ability of matter to change forms (e.g., ice to water to steam) and several philosophers proposed that all the physical materials in the world are different forms of a single primordial material, or ''[[arche]]''. The first to do so was [[Thales]], who proposed this material to be [[Water (classical element)|water]]. Thales' student, [[Anaximander]], proposed that everything came from the limitless ''[[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]''. [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] proposed the primordial material to be [[Air (classical element)|air]] on account of its perceived attractive and repulsive qualities that cause the ''arche'' to condense or dissociate into different forms. [[Anaxagoras]] proposed the principle of ''[[Nous]]'' (Mind), while [[Heraclitus]] proposed [[fire (classical element)|fire]] (and spoke of ''[[logos]]''). [[Empedocles]] proposed the elements to be earth, water, air and fire. His four-element model became very popular. Like [[Pythagoras]], [[Plato]] believed that all things were composed of [[number]], with Empedocles' elements taking the form of the [[Platonic solids]]. [[Democritus]], and later philosophers—most notably [[Leucippus]]—proposed that the Universe is composed of indivisible [[atom]]s moving through a [[void (astronomy)|void]] ([[vacuum]]), although [[Aristotle]] did not believe that to be feasible because air, like water, offers [[Drag (physics)|resistance to motion]]. Air will immediately rush in to fill a void, and moreover, without resistance, it would do so indefinitely fast.&lt;ref name=Routledge/&gt;

Although Heraclitus argued for eternal change, his contemporary [[Parmenides]] made the radical suggestion that all change is an illusion, that the true underlying reality is eternally unchanging and of a single nature. Parmenides denoted this reality as {{lang|grc|τὸ ἐν}} (The One). Parmenides' idea seemed implausible to many Greeks, but his student [[Zeno of Elea]] challenged them with several famous [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]]. Aristotle responded to these paradoxes by developing the notion of a potential countable infinity, as well as the infinitely divisible continuum. Unlike the eternal and unchanging cycles of time, he believed that the world is bounded by the celestial spheres and that cumulative stellar magnitude is only finitely multiplicative.

The [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosopher]] [[Kanada (philosopher)|Kanada]], founder of the [[Vaisheshika]] school, developed a notion of [[atomism]] and proposed that [[light]] and [[heat]] were varieties of the same substance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Will Durant]], ''Our Oriental Heritage'': {{quote|"Two systems of Hindu thought propound physical theories suggestively similar to those of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. Kanada, founder of the Vaisheshika philosophy, held that the world is composed of atoms as many in kind as the various elements. The [[Jainism|Jains]] more nearly approximated to [[Democritus]] by teaching that all atoms were of the same kind, producing different effects by diverse modes of combinations. Kanada believed light and heat to be varieties of the same substance; [[Udayana]] taught that all heat comes from the Sun; and [[Vācaspati Miśra|Vachaspati]], like [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], interpreted light as composed of minute particles emitted by substances and striking the eye."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 5th century AD, the [[Buddhist atomism|Buddhist atomist]] philosopher [[Dignāga]] proposed [[atom]]s to be point-sized, durationless, and made of energy. They denied the existence of substantial matter and proposed that movement consisted of momentary flashes of a stream of energy.&lt;ref&gt;Stcherbatsky, F. Th. (1930, 1962), ''Buddhist Logic'', Volume 1, p. 19, Dover, New York: {{quote|"The Buddhists denied the existence of substantial matter altogether. Movement consists for them of moments, it is a staccato movement, momentary flashes of a stream of energy... "Everything is evanescent",... says the Buddhist, because there is no stuff... Both systems &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Samkhya|Sānkhya]], and later Indian Buddhism] share in common a tendency to push the analysis of existence up to its minutest, last elements which are imagined as absolute qualities, or things possessing only one unique quality. They are called "qualities" (''guna-dharma'') in both systems in the sense of absolute qualities, a kind of atomic, or intra-atomic, energies of which the empirical things are composed. Both systems, therefore, agree in denying the objective reality of the categories of Substance and Quality,... and of the relation of Inference uniting them. There is in Sānkhya philosophy no separate existence of qualities. What we call quality is but a particular manifestation of a subtle entity. To every new unit of quality corresponds a subtle quantum of matter which is called ''guna'', "quality", but represents a subtle substantive entity. The same applies to early Buddhism where all qualities are substantive... or, more precisely, dynamic entities, although they are also called ''dharmas'' ('qualities')."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of [[temporal finitism]] was inspired by the doctrine of creation shared by the three [[Abrahamic religions]]: [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. The [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosopher]], [[John Philoponus]], presented the philosophical arguments against the ancient Greek notion of an infinite past and future. Philoponus' arguments against an infinite past were used by the [[Early Islamic philosophy|early Muslim philosopher]], [[Al-Kindi]] (Alkindus); the [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosopher]], [[Saadia Gaon]] (Saadia ben Joseph); and the [[Kalam|Muslim theologian]], [[Al-Ghazali]] (Algazel).&lt;ref name=Viney1985&gt;{{cite book|title=Charles Hartshorne and the Existence of God|chapter=The Cosmological Argument|author=Donald Wayne Viney|pages=65–68|year=1985|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-87395-907-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Astronomical concepts ===
{{Main|History of astronomy|Timeline of astronomy}}
[[File:Aristarchus working.jpg|thumb|right|3rd century BCE calculations by [[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]] on the relative sizes of, from left to right, the Sun, Earth, and Moon, from a 10th-century AD Greek copy.]]

Astronomical models of the Universe were proposed soon after [[astronomy]] began with the [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian astronomers]], who viewed the Universe as a [[Flat Earth|flat disk]] floating in the ocean, and this forms the premise for early Greek maps like those of [[Anaximander]] and [[Hecataeus of Miletus]].

Later [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophers, observing the motions of the heavenly bodies, were concerned with developing models of the Universe-based more profoundly on [[empirical evidence]]. The first coherent model was proposed by [[Eudoxus of Cnidos]]. According to Aristotle's physical interpretation of the model, [[celestial spheres]] eternally [[uniform circular motion|rotate with uniform motion]] around a stationary Earth. Normal [[classical elements|matter]] is entirely contained within the terrestrial sphere.

''[[De Mundo]]'' (composed before 250 BC or between 350 and 200 BC), stated, "Five elements, situated in spheres in five regions, the less being in each case surrounded by the greater—namely, earth surrounded by water, water by air, air by fire, and fire by ether—make up the whole Universe".&lt;ref name=1908DeMundo&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/demundoarisrich |title=De Mundo |year=1914 |author=Aristotle |author2=Forster, E. S. |author3=Dobson, J. F. |page=2 |location=Oxford |publisher=The Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This model was also refined by [[Callippus]] and after concentric spheres were abandoned, it was brought into nearly perfect agreement with astronomical observations by [[Ptolemy]]. The success of such a model is largely due to the mathematical fact that any function (such as the position of a planet) can be decomposed into a set of circular functions (the [[Fourier series|Fourier modes]]). Other Greek scientists, such as the [[Pythagoreans|Pythagorean]] philosopher [[Philolaus]], postulated (according to [[Stobaeus]] account) that at the center of the Universe was a "central fire" around which the [[Earth]], [[Sun]], [[Moon]] and [[Planet]]s revolved in uniform circular motion.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, C. (1968) [https://archive.org/details/AHistoryOfMathematics ''A History of Mathematics'']. Wiley, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Greek astronomy|Greek astronomer]] [[Aristarchus of Samos]] was the first known individual to propose a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model of the Universe. Though the original text has been lost, a reference in [[Archimedes]]' book ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]'' describes Aristarchus's heliocentric model. Archimedes wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You, King Gelon, are aware the Universe is the name given by most astronomers to the sphere the center of which is the center of the Earth, while its radius is equal to the straight line between the center of the Sun and the center of the Earth. This is the common account as you have heard from astronomers. But Aristarchus has brought out a book consisting of certain hypotheses, wherein it appears, as a consequence of the assumptions made, that the Universe is many times greater than the Universe just mentioned. His hypotheses are that the fixed stars and the Sun remain unmoved, that the Earth revolves about the Sun on the circumference of a circle, the Sun lying in the middle of the orbit, and that the sphere of fixed stars, situated about the same center as the Sun, is so great that the circle in which he supposes the Earth to revolve bears such a proportion to the distance of the fixed stars as the center of the sphere bears to its surface&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Aristarchus thus believed the stars to be very far away, and saw this as the reason why [[stellar parallax]] had not been observed, that is, the stars had not been observed to move relative each other as the Earth moved around the Sun. The stars are in fact much farther away than the distance that was generally assumed in ancient times, which is why stellar parallax is only detectable with precision instruments. The geocentric model, consistent with planetary parallax, was assumed to be an explanation for the unobservability of the parallel phenomenon, stellar parallax. The rejection of the heliocentric view was apparently quite strong, as the following passage from [[Plutarch]] suggests (''On the Apparent Face in the Orb of the Moon''):

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Cleanthes]] [a contemporary of Aristarchus and head of the [[Stoics]]] thought it was the duty of the Greeks to indict Aristarchus of Samos on the charge of impiety for putting in motion the Hearth of the Universe [i.e. the Earth], ... supposing the heaven to remain at rest and the Earth to revolve in an oblique circle, while it rotates, at the same time, about its own axis&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Flammarion.jpg|thumb|right|[[Flammarion engraving]], Paris 1888]]

The only other astronomer from antiquity known by name who supported Aristarchus's heliocentric model was [[Seleucus of Seleucia]], a [[Hellenistic astronomer]] who lived a century after Aristarchus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Otto E.

Seleucus' arguments for a heliocentric cosmology were probably related to the phenomenon of [[tide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucio Russo]], ''Flussi e riflussi'', Feltrinelli, Milano, 2003, {{ISBN|88-07-10349-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Strabo]] (1.1.9), Seleucus was the first to state that the tides are due to the attraction of the Moon, and that the height of the tides depends on the Moon's position relative to the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bartel|1987|loc=p. 527}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, he may have proved heliocentricity by determining the constants of a [[Geometry|geometric]] model for it, and by developing methods to compute planetary positions using this model, like what [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] later did in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bartel|1987| loc=pp. 527–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]], [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] models were also proposed by the [[Indian astronomy|Indian astronomer]] [[Aryabhata]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bartel|1987 | loc=pp. 529–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Islamic astronomy|Persian astronomers]] [[Ja'far ibn Muhammad Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi|Albumasar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bartel|1987 | loc=pp. 534–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Al-Sijzi]].&lt;ref name=Nasr&gt;{{Cite book |last=Nasr |first=Seyyed H. |authorlink=Hossein Nasr |origyear=1964 |date=1993 |title=An Introduction to Islamic Cosmological Doctrines |edition=2nd |publisher=1st edition by [[Harvard University Press]], 2nd edition by [[State University of New York Press]] |isbn=978-0-7914-1515-3 |pages=135–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ThomasDiggesmap.JPG|thumb|left|[[Copernican heliocentrism|Model of the Copernican Universe]] by [[Thomas Digges]] in 1576, with the amendment that the stars are no longer confined to a sphere, but spread uniformly throughout the space surrounding the [[planet]]s.]]

The Aristotelian model was accepted in the [[Western world]] for roughly two millennia, until Copernicus revived Aristarchus's perspective that the astronomical data could be explained more plausibly if the [[Earth]] rotated on its axis and if the [[Sun]] were placed at the center of the Universe.

{{quote|In the center rests the Sun. For who would place this lamp of a very beautiful temple in another or better place than this wherefrom it can illuminate everything at the same time?|Nicolaus Copernicus| in Chapter 10, Book 1 of ''De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestrum'' (1543)}}

As noted by Copernicus himself, the notion that the [[Earth's rotation|Earth rotates]] is very old, dating at least to [[Philolaus]] (c. 450 BC), [[Heraclides Ponticus]] (c. 350 BC) and [[Ecphantus the Pythagorean]]. Roughly a century before Copernicus, the Christian scholar [[Nicholas of Cusa]] also proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis in his book, ''On Learned Ignorance'' (1440).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Misner|Misner, Thorne and Wheeler]], p. 754.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Sijzi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Science in the Quran|volume=1|publisher=Malik Library|first=Ema Ākabara|last=Ālī|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; also proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis. [[Empirical research|Empirical evidence]] for the Earth's rotation on its axis, using the phenomenon of [[comet]]s, was given by [[Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī|Tusi]] (1201–1274) and [[Ali Qushji]] (1403–1474).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Ragep |first=F.

In 1919, when [[Hooker Telescope]] was completed, the prevailing view still was that the Universe consisted entirely of the Milky Way Galaxy. Using the Hooker Telescope, [[Edwin Hubble]] identified [[Cepheid variable]]s in several spiral nebulae and in 1922–1923 proved conclusively that [[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda Nebula]] and [[Triangulum Nebula|Triangulum]] among others, were entire galaxies outside our own, thus proving that Universe consists of multitude of galaxies.&lt;ref name="SharovNovikov1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sharov|first1=Aleksandr Sergeevich|last2=Novikov|first2=Igor Dmitrievich|title=Edwin Hubble, the discoverer of the big bang universe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ttEwkEdPc70C&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=December 31, 2011|date=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-41617-7|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Earth's atmosphere.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The interface between the Earth's surface and outer space. The [[Kármán line]] at an altitude of {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} is shown. The layers of [[atmosphere of Earth|the atmosphere]] are drawn to scale, whereas objects within them, such as the [[International Space Station]], are not.]]

'''Outer space''', or just '''space''', is the expanse that exists beyond the [[Earth]] and outside of any [[astronomical object]]. Outer space is not completely empty—it is a [[hard vacuum]] containing a low density of particles, predominantly a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] as well as [[electromagnetic radiation]], [[magnetic field]]s, [[cosmic neutrino background|neutrinos]], [[cosmic dust|dust]], and [[cosmic ray]]s. The baseline [[temperature]], as set by the [[cosmic background radiation|background radiation]] from the [[Big Bang]], is {{Convert|2.7|K|C F|abbr=out}}.&lt;ref name="CBE2008" /&gt; The [[Warm–hot intergalactic medium|plasma between galaxies]] accounts for about half of the [[baryonic matter|baryonic (ordinary) matter]] in the universe; it has a [[number density]] of less than one [[hydrogen atom]] per [[cubic metre]] and a temperature of millions of kelvins;&lt;ref name=baas41_908/&gt; local concentrations of this plasma have condensed into [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]]. Studies indicate that 90% of the mass in most galaxies is in an unknown form, called [[dark matter]], which interacts with other matter through [[gravitation]]al but not [[electromagnetic force]]s.{{sfn|Freedman|Kaufmann|2005|pp=573, 599–601}}&lt;ref name="Trimble 1987" /&gt; Observations suggest that the majority of the [[Mass–energy equivalence|mass-energy]] in the [[observable universe]] is a poorly understood [[vacuum energy]] of space, which astronomers label ''[[dark energy]]''.&lt;ref name="nasa_darkenergy" /&gt;{{sfn|Freedman|Kaufmann|2005|pp=650–653}} Intergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the [[universe]], but even galaxies and [[star system]]s consist almost entirely of empty space.

Outer space does not begin at a definite altitude above the Earth's surface. However, the [[Kármán line]], an altitude of {{Convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} above sea level,{{sfn|O'Leary|2009|p=84}}&lt;ref name=space_begin/&gt; is conventionally used as the start of outer space in space treaties and for aerospace records keeping. The framework for international [[space law]] was established by the [[Outer Space Treaty]], which entered into force on 10 October 1967. This treaty precludes any claims of [[national sovereignty]] and permits all states to freely [[space exploration|explore outer space]]. Despite the drafting of [[UN resolution]]s for the peaceful uses of outer space, [[anti-satellite weapon]]s have been tested in Earth orbit.

Humans began the physical exploration of space during the 20th century with the advent of high-altitude [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloon flights]], followed by manned [[rocket launch]]es. [[Earth orbit]] was first achieved by [[Yuri Gagarin]] of the Soviet Union in 1961, and [[unmanned spacecraft]] have since reached all of the known [[planet]]s in the [[Solar System]]. Due to the high cost of getting into space, manned [[spaceflight]] has been limited to low Earth orbit and the [[Moon]].

Outer space represents a challenging environment for human exploration because of the hazards of vacuum and [[radiation]]. [[Microgravity]] also has a negative effect on human [[physiology]] that causes both [[muscle atrophy]] and [[Spaceflight osteopenia|bone loss]]. In addition to these health and environmental issues, the economic cost of putting objects, including humans, into space is very high.

== Discovery ==
In 350 BCE, Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] suggested that ''nature abhors a vacuum'', a principle that became known as the ''[[Horror vacui (physics)|horror vacui]]''. This concept built upon a 5th-century BCE [[Ontology|ontological]] argument by the Greek philosopher [[Parmenides]], who denied the possible existence of a void in space.{{sfn|Grant|1981|p=10}} Based on this idea that a vacuum could not exist, in the [[Western culture|West]] it was widely held for many centuries that space could not be empty.{{sfn|Porter|Park|Daston|2006|p=27}} As late as the 17th century, the French philosopher [[René Descartes]] argued that the entirety of space must be filled.{{sfn|Eckert|2006|p=5}}

In [[ancient China]], the 2nd-century astronomer [[Zhang Heng]] became convinced that space must be infinite, extending well beyond the mechanism that supported the Sun and the stars. The surviving books of the Hsüan Yeh school said that the heavens were boundless, "empty and void of substance". Likewise, the "sun, moon, and the company of stars float in the empty space, moving or standing still".{{sfn|Needham|Ronan|1985|pp=82–87}}

The Italian scientist [[Galileo Galilei]] knew that air had mass and so was subject to gravity. In 1640, he demonstrated that an established force resisted the formation of a vacuum. However, it would remain for his pupil [[Evangelista Torricelli]] to create an apparatus that would produce a partial vacuum in 1643. This experiment resulted in the first mercury [[barometer]] and created a scientific sensation in Europe. The French mathematician [[Blaise Pascal]] reasoned that if the column of mercury was supported by air, then the column ought to be shorter at higher altitude where the [[air pressure]] is lower.{{sfn|Holton|Brush|2001|pp=267–268}} In 1648, his brother-in-law, Florin Périer, repeated the experiment on the [[Puy de Dôme]] mountain in central France and found that the column was shorter by three inches. This decrease in pressure was further demonstrated by carrying a half-full balloon up a mountain and watching it gradually expand, then contract upon descent.{{sfn|Cajori|1917|pp=64–66}}

[[File:Magedurger Halbkugeln Luftpumpe Deutsches Museum.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The original [[Magdeburg hemispheres]] (lower left) used to demonstrate Otto von Guericke's vacuum pump (right)|alt=A glass display case holds a mechanical device with a lever arm, plus two metal hemispheres attached to draw ropes]]

In 1650, German scientist [[Otto von Guericke]] constructed the first vacuum pump: a device that would further refute the principle of ''horror vacui''. He correctly noted that the atmosphere of the Earth surrounds the planet like a shell, with the [[density]] gradually declining with altitude. He concluded that there must be a vacuum between the Earth and the Moon.{{sfn|Genz|2001|pp=127–128}}

Back in the 15th century, German theologian [[Nicolaus Cusanus]] speculated that the [[Universe]] lacked a center and a circumference. He believed that the Universe, while not infinite, could not be held as finite as it lacked any bounds within which it could be contained.{{sfn|Tassoul|Tassoul|2004|p=22}} These ideas led to speculations as to the infinite dimension of space by the Italian philosopher [[Giordano Bruno]] in the 16th century. He extended the Copernican [[heliocentric]] [[cosmology]] to the concept of an infinite Universe filled with a substance he called [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], which did not resist the motion of heavenly bodies.{{sfn|Gatti|2002|pp=99–104}} English philosopher [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] arrived at a similar conclusion, arguing that the stars are visible to us only because they are surrounded by a thin aether or a void.{{sfn|Kelly|1965|pp=97–107}} This concept of an aether originated with [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosophers, including Aristotle, who conceived of it as the medium through which the heavenly bodies move.{{sfn|Olenick|Apostol|Goodstein|1986|p=356}}

The concept of a Universe filled with a [[luminiferous aether]] retained support among some scientists until the early 20th century. This form of aether was viewed as the medium through which light could propagate.{{sfn|Hariharan|2003|p=2}} In 1887, the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] tried to detect the Earth's motion through this medium by looking for changes in the [[speed of light]] depending on the direction of the planet's motion. However, the [[null result]] indicated something was wrong with the concept. The idea of the luminiferous aether was then abandoned. It was replaced by [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[special relativity]], which holds that the speed of light in a vacuum is a fixed constant, independent of the observer's motion or [[frame of reference]].{{sfn|Olenick|Apostol|Goodstein|1986|pp=357–365}}{{sfn|Thagard|1992|pp=206–209}}

The first professional [[astronomer]] to support the concept of an infinite Universe was the Englishman [[Thomas Digges]] in 1576.{{sfn|Maor|1991|p=195}} But the scale of the Universe remained unknown until the first successful measurement of the distance to a nearby star in 1838 by the German astronomer [[Friedrich Bessel]]. He showed that the star [[61 Cygni]] had a [[stellar parallax|parallax]] of just 0.31&amp;nbsp;[[arcsecond]]s (compared to the modern value of 0.287″). This corresponds to a distance of over 10 [[light year]]s.{{sfn|Webb|1999|pp=71–73}} In 1917, [[Heber Doust Curtis|Heber Curtis]] noted that [[nova]]e in spiral nebulae were, on average, 10 magnitudes fainter than galactic novae, suggesting that the former are 100 times further away.&lt;ref name=Curtis1988/&gt; The distance to the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] was determined in 1923 by American astronomer [[Edwin Hubble]] by measuring the brightness of [[cepheid variable]]s in that galaxy, a new technique discovered by [[Henrietta Leavitt]].&lt;ref name=csiro_20041025/&gt; This established that the Andromeda galaxy, and by extension all galaxies, lay well outside the [[Milky Way]].{{sfn|Tyson|Goldsmith|2004|pp=114–115}}

The modern concept of outer space is based on the [[Big Bang cosmology|"Big Bang" cosmology]], first proposed in 1931 by the Belgian physicist [[Georges Lemaître]].&lt;ref name=nature127_3210_706/&gt; This theory holds that the universe originated from a very dense form that has since undergone continuous [[Hubble's law|expansion]].

The earliest known estimate of the temperature of outer space was by the Swiss physicist [[Charles Édouard Guillaume|Charles É. Guillaume]] in 1896. Using the estimated radiation of the background stars, he concluded that space must be heated to a temperature of 5–6&amp;nbsp;K. British physicist [[Arthur Eddington]] made a similar calculation to derive a temperature of 3.18&amp;nbsp;K in 1926. German physicist [[Erich Regener]] used the total measured energy of [[cosmic ray]]s to estimate an intergalactic temperature of 2.8&amp;nbsp;K in 1933.&lt;ref name="Apeiron2_3_79"/&gt; American physicists [[Ralph Alpher]] and [[Robert Herman]] predicted 5&amp;nbsp;K for the temperature of space in 1948, based on the gradual decrease in background energy following the then-new [[Big Bang]] theory.&lt;ref name="Apeiron2_3_79"/&gt; The modern measurement of the [[cosmic microwave background]] is about 2.7K.

The term ''outward space'' was used in 1842 by the English poet Lady [[Emmeline Stuart-Wortley]] in her poem "The Maiden of Moscow".{{sfn|Stuart Wortley|1841|p=410}} The expression ''outer space'' was used as an astronomical term by [[Alexander von Humboldt]] in 1845.{{sfn|Von Humboldt|1845|p=39}} It was later popularized in the writings of [[H. G. Wells]] in 1901.&lt;ref name="entymonline"/&gt; The shorter term ''space'' is older, first used to mean the region beyond Earth's sky in [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' in 1667.&lt;ref name=harper2001/&gt;

== Formation and state ==
[[File:CMB Timeline300 no WMAP.jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|This is an artist's concept of the [[metric expansion of space]], where a volume of the Universe is represented at each time interval by the circular sections. At left is depicted the rapid [[Inflationary epoch|inflation]] from the initial state, followed thereafter by steady expansion to the present day, shown at right.]]
{{Main|Big Bang}}
According to the Big Bang theory, the very early Universe was an extremely hot and dense state about [[age of the universe|13.8&amp;nbsp;billion years ago]]&lt;ref name=planck_2013 /&gt; which rapidly [[Metric expansion of space|expanded]]. About 380,000 years later the Universe had cooled sufficiently to allow protons and electrons to combine and form hydrogen—the so-called [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination epoch]]. When this happened, matter and energy became decoupled, allowing photons to travel freely through the continually expanding space.&lt;ref name="SciAm301_1_36"/&gt; Matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create [[star]]s, [[galaxy|galaxies]] and other [[astronomical object]]s, leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms what is now called outer space.{{sfn|Silk|2000|pp=105–308}} As light has a finite velocity, this theory also constrains the size of the directly observable universe.&lt;ref name="SciAm301_1_36"/&gt; This leaves open the question as to whether the Universe is finite or infinite.

The present day [[shape of the universe]] has been determined from measurements of the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|cosmic microwave background]] using satellites like the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]]. These observations indicate that the [[spatial geometry]] of the observable universe is "[[Flatness (cosmology)|flat]]", meaning that photons on parallel paths at one point remain parallel as they travel through space to the limit of the observable universe, except for local gravity.&lt;ref name="WMAP"/&gt; The flat Universe, combined with the measured mass density of the Universe and the accelerating [[Hubble's law|expansion of the Universe]], indicates that space has a non-zero [[vacuum energy]], which is called [[dark energy]].{{sfn|Sparke|Gallagher|2007|pp=329–330}}

Estimates put the average energy density of the present day Universe at the equivalent of 5.9 protons per cubic meter, including dark energy, [[dark matter]], and [[baryonic matter]] (ordinary matter composed of atoms). The atoms account for only 4.6% of the total energy density, or a density of one proton per four cubic meters.&lt;ref name=nasa_wmap/&gt; The density of the Universe, however, is clearly not uniform; it ranges from relatively high density in galaxies—including very high density in structures within galaxies, such as planets, stars, and [[black hole]]s—to conditions in vast [[Void (astronomy)|voids]] that have much lower density, at least in terms of visible matter.&lt;ref name=aj89_1461/&gt; Unlike matter and dark matter, dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies: although dark energy may account for a majority of the mass-energy in the Universe, dark energy's influence is 5 [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] smaller than the influence of gravity from matter and dark matter within the Milky Way.&lt;ref name=rvmphys_75_559 /&gt;

They typically have white, red or blue hues.]]
Outer space is the closest known approximation to a [[perfect vacuum]]. It has effectively no [[friction]], allowing stars, [[planets]], and [[moons]] to move freely along their ideal [[orbit]]s, following the [[Planetary formation|initial formation]] stage. However, even the deep vacuum of [[Outer space#Intergalactic|intergalactic space]] is not devoid of [[matter]], as it contains a few [[hydrogen atoms]] per cubic meter.&lt;ref name=pasj20_230/&gt; By comparison, the air humans breathe contains about 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; molecules per cubic meter.{{sfn|Borowitz|Beiser|1971}}&lt;ref name=patrick/&gt; The low density of matter in outer space means that [[electromagnetic radiation]] can travel great distances without being scattered: the [[mean free path]] of a [[photon]] in intergalactic space is about 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;km, or 10&amp;nbsp;billion light years.{{sfn|Davies|1977|p=93}} In spite of this, [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]], which is the [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] and [[scattering]] of photons by dust and gas, is an important factor in galactic and intergalactic [[astronomy]].&lt;ref name=fitzpatrick2004/&gt;

Stars, planets, and moons retain their [[atmosphere]]s by gravitational attraction. Atmospheres have no clearly delineated upper boundary: the density of atmospheric gas gradually decreases with distance from the object until it becomes indistinguishable from outer space.{{sfn|Chamberlain|1978|p=2}} The Earth's atmospheric [[pressure]] drops to about {{nowrap|0.032 }}[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] at {{Convert|100|km|mi|abbr=off}} of altitude,&lt;ref name=squire2000/&gt; compared to 100,000 Pa for the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) definition of [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard pressure]]. Above this altitude, isotropic gas pressure rapidly becomes insignificant when compared to [[radiation pressure]] from the [[Sun]] and the [[dynamic pressure]] of the [[solar wind]]. The [[thermosphere]] in this range has large gradients of pressure, temperature and composition, and varies greatly due to [[space weather]].&lt;ref name=jmsj_85B_193/&gt;

The temperature of outer space is measured in terms of the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic]] activity of the gas, as it is on Earth. However, the radiation of outer space has a different temperature than the kinetic temperature of the gas, meaning that the gas and radiation are not in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].{{sfn|Prialnik|2000|pp=195–196}}{{sfn|Spitzer|1978|p=28–30}} All of the observable universe is filled with photons that were created during the [[Big Bang]], which is known as the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMB). (There is quite likely a correspondingly large number of [[neutrino]]s called the [[cosmic neutrino background]].&lt;ref name="fp2_30"/&gt;) The current [[black body]] temperature of the background radiation is about {{convert|3|K|C F|0|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name=apj707_2_916/&gt; The gas temperatures in outer space are always at least the temperature of the CMB but can be much higher. For example, the [[corona]] of the Sun reaches temperatures over 1.2–2.6&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref name=apj325_442/&gt;

Magnetic fields have been detected in the space around just about every class of celestial object. Star formation in spiral galaxies can generate small-scale [[dynamo]]s, creating turbulent magnetic field strengths of around 5–10&amp;nbsp;μ[[Gauss (unit)|G]]. The [[Davis–Greenstein effect]] causes elongated [[Cosmic dust|dust grains]] to align themselves with a galaxy's magnetic field, resulting in weak optical [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]]. This has been used to show ordered magnetic fields exist in several nearby galaxies. [[Magnetohydrodynamics|Magneto-hydrodynamic]] processes in [[Active galactic nucleus|active]] [[Elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]] produce their characteristic [[Astrophysical jet|jets]] and [[radio lobe]]s. Non-thermal [[Astronomical radio source|radio sources]] have been detected even among the most distant, [[redshift|high-z]] sources, indicating the presence of magnetic fields.&lt;ref name=WielebinskiBeck2010/&gt;

Outside a protective atmosphere and magnetic field, there are few obstacles to the passage through space of energetic [[subatomic particle]]s known as cosmic rays. These particles have energies ranging from about 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Electronvolt|eV]] up to an extreme 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;eV of [[ultra-high-energy cosmic ray]]s.&lt;ref name=rmp83_3_907/&gt; The peak flux of cosmic rays occurs at energies of about 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;eV, with approximately 87% protons, 12% helium nuclei and 1% heavier nuclei. In the high energy range, the flux of [[electron]]s is only about 1% of that of protons.{{sfn|Lang|1999|p=462}} Cosmic rays can damage electronic components and pose a [[Health threat from cosmic rays|health threat]] to space travelers.{{sfn|Lide|1993|p=11{{hyphen}}217&lt;!-- Note: this is not a page range --&gt;}} According to astronauts, like [[Don Pettit]], space has a burned/metallic odor that clings to their suits and equipment, similar to the scent of an [[arc welding]] torch.&lt;ref name=ls2012/&gt;&lt;ref name="PopSicSmell"/&gt;

Despite the harsh environment, several life forms have been found that can withstand extreme space conditions for extended periods. Species of lichen carried on the ESA [[BIOPAN]] facility survived exposure for ten days in 2007.&lt;ref name="Astrobiology_11_4_281"/&gt; Seeds of ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' and ''[[Nicotiana tabacum]]'' germinated after being exposed to space for 1.5 years.&lt;ref name="Astrobiology_12_5_517"/&gt; A strain of ''[[bacillus subtilis]]'' has survived 559 days when exposed to low-Earth orbit or a simulated martian environment.&lt;ref name="Astrobiology_12_5_498"/&gt; The [[Panspermia|lithopanspermia]] hypothesis suggests that rocks ejected into outer space from life-harboring planets may successfully transport life forms to another habitable world. A conjecture is that just such a scenario occurred early in the history of the Solar System, with potentially [[microorganism]]-bearing rocks being exchanged between Venus, Earth, and Mars.&lt;ref name="Nicholson2010"/&gt;

Even at relatively low altitudes in the Earth's atmosphere, conditions are hostile to the human body. The altitude where atmospheric pressure matches the [[vapor pressure of water]] at the [[Human body temperature|temperature of the human body]] is called the [[Armstrong line]], named after American physician [[Harry G. Armstrong]]. It is located at an altitude of around {{convert|19.14|km|mi|abbr=on}}. At or above the Armstrong line, fluids in the throat and lungs boil away. More specifically, exposed bodily liquids such as saliva, tears, and liquids in the lungs boil away. Hence, at this altitude, human survival requires a pressure suit, or a pressurized capsule.{{sfn|Piantadosi|2003|pp=188–189}}

Once in space, sudden exposure of unprotected humans to very low [[Atmospheric pressure|pressure]], such as during a rapid decompression, can cause [[pulmonary barotrauma]]—a rupture of the lungs, due to the large pressure differential between inside and outside the chest.&lt;ref name=ajeas2_4_573/&gt; Even if the subject's airway is fully open, the flow of air through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the rupture.&lt;ref name=krebs_pilmanis1996/&gt; Rapid decompression can rupture eardrums and sinuses, bruising and blood seep can occur in soft tissues, and shock can cause an increase in oxygen consumption that leads to [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].&lt;ref name=ajeas2_4_573/&gt;

As a consequence of rapid decompression, [[oxygen]] dissolved in the blood empties into the lungs to try to equalize the [[partial pressure]] gradient. Once the deoxygenated blood arrives at the brain, humans lose consciousness after a few seconds and die of hypoxia within minutes.&lt;ref name=bmj286/&gt; Blood and other body fluids boil when the pressure drops below 6.3&amp;nbsp;kPa, and this condition is called [[ebullism]].&lt;ref name=jramc157_1_85/&gt; The steam may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation, but tissues are elastic and porous enough to prevent rupture. Ebullism is slowed by the pressure containment of blood vessels, so some blood remains liquid.{{sfn|Billings|1973|pp=1–34}}&lt;ref name=landis20070807/&gt; Swelling and ebullism can be reduced by containment in a [[pressure suit]]. The Crew Altitude Protection Suit (CAPS), a fitted elastic garment designed in the 1960s for astronauts, prevents ebullism at pressures as low as 2 kPa.&lt;ref name=am39_376/&gt; Supplemental oxygen is needed at {{Convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} to provide enough oxygen for breathing and to prevent water loss, while above {{Convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} pressure suits are essential to prevent ebullism.{{sfn|Ellery|2000|p=68}} Most space suits use around 30–39&amp;nbsp;kPa of pure oxygen, about the same as on the Earth's surface. This pressure is high enough to prevent ebullism, but evaporation of nitrogen dissolved in the blood could still cause [[decompression sickness]] and [[air embolism|gas embolisms]] if not managed.{{sfn|Davis|Johnson|Stepanek|2008|pp=270–271}}

[[Human evolution|Humans evolved]] for life in Earth [[Gravitation|gravity]], and exposure to weightlessness has been shown to have deleterious effects on human health. Initially, more than 50% of astronauts experience [[space motion sickness]]. This can cause [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], headaches, [[lethargy]], and overall malaise. The duration of space sickness varies, but it typically lasts for 1–3 days, after which the body adjusts to the new environment. Longer-term exposure to weightlessness results in [[muscle atrophy]] and deterioration of the [[Human skeleton|skeleton]], or [[spaceflight osteopenia]]. These effects can be minimized through a regimen of exercise.&lt;ref name=spp22_15/&gt; Other effects include fluid redistribution, slowing of the [[cardiovascular system]], decreased production of [[red blood cell]]s, balance disorders, and a weakening of the [[immune system]]. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, and puffiness of the face.&lt;ref name=cmaj180_13_1317/&gt;

For long-duration space travel, radiation can pose an [[acute health hazard]].
Exposure to high-energy, ionizing [[cosmic rays]] can result in fatigue, nausea, vomiting, as well as damage to the immune system and changes to the [[white blood cell]] count. Over longer durations, symptoms include an increased risk of [[cancer]], plus damage to the [[Human eye|eyes]], [[nervous system]], [[Human lung|lungs]] and the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]].&lt;ref name=nsbri_radiation/&gt; On a round-trip [[Mars]] mission lasting three years, a large fraction of the cells in an astronaut's body would be traversed and potentially damaged by high energy nuclei.&lt;ref name=curtis_and_Letaw/&gt; The energy of such particles is significantly diminished by the shielding provided by the walls of a spacecraft and can be further diminished by water containers and other barriers. However, the impact of the cosmic rays upon the shielding produces additional radiation that can affect the crew. Further research is needed to assess the radiation hazards and determine suitable countermeasures.&lt;ref name=sas4_11_1013/&gt;

There is no clear boundary between [[Earth's atmosphere]] and space, as the density of the atmosphere gradually decreases as the altitude increases. There are several standard boundary designations, namely:
* The [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] has established the [[Kármán line]] at an altitude of {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} as a working definition for the boundary between aeronautics and astronautics. This is used because at an altitude of about {{Convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}}, as [[Theodore von Kármán]] calculated, a vehicle would have to travel faster than [[Orbital speed|orbital velocity]] to derive sufficient [[aerodynamic lift]] from the atmosphere to support itself.{{sfn|O'Leary|2009|p=84}}&lt;ref name=space_begin/&gt;
* The United States designates people who travel above an altitude of {{convert|50|mi|km}} as [[astronaut]]s.{{sfn|Wong|Fergusson|2010|p=16}}
* [[NASA]]'s Space Shuttle used 400,000 feet (76&amp;nbsp;mi, 122&amp;nbsp;km) as its [[atmospheric reentry|re-entry]] altitude (termed the Entry Interface), which roughly marks the boundary where [[atmospheric drag]] becomes noticeable, thus beginning the process of switching from steering with thrusters to maneuvering with aerodynamic control surfaces.&lt;ref name=petty20030213/&gt;

In 2009, scientists reported detailed measurements with a Supra-Thermal Ion Imager (an instrument that measures the direction and speed of ions), which allowed them to establish a boundary at {{Convert|118|km|mi|abbr=on}} above Earth. The boundary represents the midpoint of a gradual transition over tens of kilometers from the relatively gentle winds of the Earth's atmosphere to the more violent flows of charged particles in space, which can reach speeds well over {{Convert|268|m/s|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=thompton20090409/&gt;&lt;ref name=jgr114/&gt;

The [[Outer Space Treaty]] provides the basic framework for international space law. It covers the legal use of outer space by nation states, and includes in its definition of ''outer space'' the Moon and other celestial bodies. The treaty states that outer space is free for all nation states to explore and is not subject to claims of national [[sovereignty]]. It also prohibits the deployment of [[nuclear weapon]]s in outer space. The treaty was passed by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1963 and signed in 1967 by the USSR, the United States of America and the United Kingdom. As of 2017, 105 state parties have either ratified or acceded to the treaty. An additional 25 states signed the treaty, without ratifying it.&lt;ref name="unoosa2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=unoosa/&gt;

Since 1958, outer space has been the subject of multiple United Nations resolutions. Of these, more than 50 have been concerning the international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space and preventing an arms race in space.&lt;ref name=garros/&gt; Four additional [[space law]] treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the UN's [[United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space|Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space]]. Still, there remains no legal prohibition against deploying conventional weapons in space, and [[anti-satellite weapon]]s have been successfully tested by the US, USSR and China.{{sfn|Wong|Fergusson|2010|p=4}} The 1979 [[Moon Treaty]] turned the jurisdiction of all heavenly bodies (including the orbits around such bodies) over to the international community. However, this treaty has not been ratified by any nation that currently practices manned spaceflight.&lt;ref name=esf20071105/&gt;

In 1976, eight equatorial states ([[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], [[Brazil]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Zaire]], [[Uganda]], [[Kenya]], and [[Indonesia]]) met in [[Bogotá]], Colombia. With their "Declaration of the First Meeting of Equatorial Countries", or "the Bogotá Declaration", they claimed control of the segment of the geosynchronous orbital path corresponding to each country.&lt;ref name=bogota1976/&gt; These claims are not internationally accepted.&lt;ref name=aasl31_2006/&gt;

== Earth orbit ==
{{main|Geocentric orbit}}
A spacecraft enters orbit when its [[Centripetal force|centripetal]] [[acceleration]] due to [[Gravitation|gravity]] is less than or equal to the [[centrifugal force|centrifugal]] acceleration due to the horizontal component of its velocity. For a [[low Earth orbit]], this velocity is about {{Convert|7800|m/s|km/h mph|-2|abbr=on}};&lt;ref name=hill1999/&gt; by contrast, the fastest manned airplane speed ever achieved (excluding speeds achieved by deorbiting spacecraft) was {{Convert|2200|m/s|km/h mph|-2|abbr=on}} in 1967 by the [[North American X-15]].&lt;ref name=shiner20071101/&gt;

To achieve an orbit, a [[spacecraft]] must travel faster than a [[sub-orbital spaceflight]]. The energy required to reach Earth orbital velocity at an altitude of {{Convert|600|km|mi|abbr=on}} is about 36&amp;nbsp;[[Megajoule|MJ]]/kg, which is six times the energy needed merely to climb to the corresponding altitude.&lt;ref name=dimotakis1999/&gt; Spacecraft with a [[Apsis|perigee]] below about {{Convert|2000|km|mi|abbr=on}} are subject to drag from the Earth's atmosphere,{{sfn|Ghosh|2000|pp=47–48}} which decreases the orbital altitude. The rate of orbital decay depends on the satellite's cross-sectional area and mass, as well as variations in the air density of the upper atmosphere. Below about {{Convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}}, decay becomes more rapid with lifetimes measured in days. Once a satellite descends to {{Convert|180|km|mi|abbr=on}}, it has only hours before it vaporizes in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=slsa/&gt; The [[escape velocity]] required to pull free of Earth's gravitational field altogether and move into interplanetary space is about {{Convert|11200|m/s|km/h mph|-2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=williams2010/&gt;

== Regions ==
Space is a partial vacuum: its different regions are defined by the various atmospheres and "winds" that dominate within them, and extend to the point at which those winds give way to those beyond. Geospace extends from Earth's atmosphere to the outer reaches of Earth's magnetic field, whereupon it gives way to the solar wind of interplanetary space.{{sfn|Schrijver|Siscoe|2010|p=363}} Interplanetary space extends to the heliopause, whereupon the solar wind gives way to the winds of the [[interstellar medium]].&lt;ref name=universetoday_interplanetaryspace /&gt; Interstellar space then continues to the edges of the galaxy, where it fades into the intergalactic void.&lt;ref name=jpl_interstellarspace /&gt;

=== Geospace ===

Nebulous red streamers climb upward from the limb of the disk toward the black sky. The Space Shuttle is visible along the left edge.]]

[[wikt:geospace|Geospace]] is the region of outer space near Earth, including the upper atmosphere and [[magnetosphere]].{{sfn|Schrijver|Siscoe|2010|p=363}} The [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s lie within the geospace. The outer boundary of geospace is the [[magnetopause]], which forms an interface between the Earth's magnetosphere and the solar wind. The inner boundary is the [[ionosphere]].&lt;ref name=geospace/&gt; The variable space-weather conditions of geospace are affected by the behavior of the Sun and the solar wind; the subject of geospace is interlinked with [[heliophysics]]—the study of the Sun and its impact on the planets of the Solar System.{{sfn|Fichtner|Liu|2011|pp=341–345}}

The day-side magnetopause is compressed by solar-wind pressure—the subsolar distance from the center of the Earth is typically 10 Earth radii. On the night side, the solar wind stretches the magnetosphere to form a [[magnetotail]] that sometimes extends out to more than 100–200 Earth radii.{{sfn|Koskinen|2010|pp=32, 42}}&lt;ref name=HonesJr1986/&gt; For roughly four days of each month, the lunar surface is shielded from the solar wind as the Moon passes through the magnetotail.{{sfn|Mendillo|2000|p=275}}

Geospace is populated by electrically charged particles at very low densities, the motions of which are controlled by the [[Earth's magnetic field]]. These plasmas form a medium from which storm-like disturbances powered by the solar wind can drive electrical currents into the Earth's upper atmosphere. [[Geomagnetic storm]]s can disturb two regions of geospace, the radiation belts and the ionosphere. These storms increase fluxes of energetic electrons that can permanently damage satellite electronics, interfering with shortwave radio communication and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] location and timing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Space Weather &amp; Telecommunications |first=John M. |last=Goodman |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4465qvHUZusC&amp;pg=PA244|isbn=978-0-387-23671-1|page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnetic storms can also be a hazard to astronauts, even in low Earth orbit. They also create [[aurora (astronomy)|aurorae]] seen at high latitudes in an oval surrounding the [[geomagnetic pole]]s.&lt;ref name=oecd/&gt;

Although it meets the definition of outer space, the atmospheric density within the first few hundred kilometers above the Kármán line is still sufficient to produce significant [[Drag (physics)|drag]] on [[satellite]]s.&lt;ref name=slsa/&gt; This region contains material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches that are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this [[space debris|debris]] re-enters Earth's atmosphere periodically.&lt;ref name=portree_loftus1999/&gt;

====Cislunar space====
[[File:Artist's concept of Cislunar Spacecraft Configuration.jpg|right|thumb|Proposed spacecraft for manned cislunar travel in the [[2020s in spaceflight|2020s]]]]

[[gravity of Earth|Earth's gravity]] keeps the [[Moon]] in orbit at an [[lunar distance (astronomy)|average distance]] of {{cvt|384403|km|mi}}. The region outside [[atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] and extending out to just beyond the [[orbit of the Moon|Moon's orbit]], including the [[Lagrangian point]]s, is sometimes referred to as '''cislunar space'''.&lt;ref name=sr2165/&gt;

The region of space where Earth's gravity remains dominant against gravitational [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] from the Sun is called the [[Hill sphere]].&lt;ref name=yoder1995/&gt; This extends well out into translunar space to a distance of roughly 1% of the mean distance from Earth to the Sun,{{sfn|Barbieri|2006|p=253}} or {{convert|1.5|e6km|e6mi|abbr=unit}}.

'''Deep space''' has different definitions as to where it starts. It has been defined by the United States government and others as any region beyond cislunar space.{{sfn|Dickson|2010|p=57}}{{sfn|United States|p=536}}{{sfn|Williamson|2006|p=97}}&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt; The [[ITU-R|International Telecommunication Union responsible for radio communication]] (including satellites) defines the beginning of deep space at about 5 times that distance ({{Val|2e6|u=km}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://life.itu.int/radioclub/rr/art1.pdf |title=ITU-R Radio Regulations, Article 1, Terms and definitions, Section VIII, Technical terms relating to space, paragraph 1.177. |publisher=International Telecommunication Union |accessdate=2018-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interplanetary space ===
{{main|Interplanetary medium}}
[[File:Comet Hale-Bopp 1995O1.jpg|right|thumb|The sparse plasma (blue) and dust (white) in the tail of [[comet Hale–Bopp]] are being shaped by pressure from [[Sunlight|solar radiation]] and the solar wind, respectively|alt=At lower left, a white coma stands out against a black background. Nebulous material streams away to the top and left, slowly fading with distance.]]
Interplanetary space is defined by the solar wind, a continuous stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun that creates a very tenuous atmosphere (the [[heliosphere]]) for billions of kilometers into space. This wind has a particle density of 5–10 [[proton]]s/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and is moving at a velocity of {{Convert|350|-|400|km/s|mph|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Papagiannis|1972|pp=12–149}} Interplanetary space extends out to the [[Astropause|heliopause]] where the influence of the galactic environment starts to dominate over the magnetic field and particle flux from the Sun.&lt;ref name=universetoday_interplanetaryspace /&gt; The distance and strength of the heliopause varies depending on the activity level of the solar wind.&lt;ref name=phillips2009/&gt; The heliopause in turn deflects away low-energy galactic cosmic rays, with this modulation effect peaking during solar maximum.&lt;ref name=Kohler2017/&gt;

The volume of interplanetary space is a nearly total vacuum, with a mean free path of about one [[astronomical unit]] at the orbital distance of the Earth. However, this space is not completely empty, and is sparsely filled with cosmic rays, which include [[ion]]ized [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and various subatomic particles. There is also gas, [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] and dust, small [[meteor]]s, and several dozen types of [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[molecule]]s discovered to date by [[rotational spectroscopy|microwave spectroscopy]].&lt;ref name=asp2003/&gt; A cloud of interplanetary dust is visible at night as a faint band called the [[zodiacal light]].&lt;ref name="leinert_grun_1990"/&gt;

Interplanetary space contains the magnetic field generated by the Sun.{{sfn|Papagiannis|1972|pp=12–149}} There are also magnetospheres generated by planets such as Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury and the Earth that have their own magnetic fields. These are shaped by the influence of the solar wind into the approximation of a teardrop shape, with the long tail extending outward behind the planet. These magnetic fields can trap particles from the solar wind and other sources, creating belts of charged particles such as the Van Allen radiation belts. Planets without magnetic fields, such as Mars, have their atmospheres gradually eroded by the solar wind.&lt;ref name=ssr69_3_215/&gt;

=== Interstellar space ===

Interstellar space is the physical space within a galaxy beyond the influence each star has upon the encompassed plasma.&lt;ref name=jpl_interstellarspace /&gt; The contents of interstellar space are called the interstellar medium. Approximately 70% of the mass of the interstellar medium consists of lone hydrogen atoms; most of the remainder consists of helium atoms. This is enriched with trace amounts of heavier atoms formed through [[stellar nucleosynthesis]]. These atoms are ejected into the interstellar medium by [[stellar wind]]s or when evolved stars begin to shed their outer envelopes such as during the formation of a [[planetary nebula]].&lt;ref name="Ferrière2001"/&gt; The cataclysmic explosion of a [[supernova]] generates an expanding [[shock wave]] consisting of ejected materials that further enrich the medium.&lt;ref name="witt2001"/&gt; The density of matter in the interstellar medium can vary considerably: the average is around 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; particles per m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref name=Boulares1990/&gt; but cold [[molecular clouds]] can hold 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; per m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.{{sfn|Prialnik|2000|pp=195–196}}&lt;ref name="Ferrière2001"/&gt;

A [[List of interstellar and circumstellar molecules|number of molecules]] exist in interstellar space, as can tiny 0.1&amp;nbsp;[[Micrometre|μm]] dust particles.{{sfn|Rauchfuss|2008|pp=72–81}} The tally of molecules discovered through [[radio astronomy]] is steadily increasing at the rate of about four new species per year. Large regions of higher density matter known as [[molecular cloud]]s allow chemical reactions to occur, including the formation of organic polyatomic species. Much of this chemistry is driven by collisions. Energetic cosmic rays penetrate the cold, dense clouds and ionize hydrogen and helium, resulting, for example, in the [[trihydrogen cation]]. An ionized helium atom can then split relatively abundant [[carbon monoxide]] to produce ionized carbon, which in turn can lead to organic chemical reactions.&lt;ref name="PNAS103_33_12232"/&gt;

The local interstellar medium is a region of space within 100&amp;nbsp;[[parsec]]s (pc) of the Sun, which is of interest both for its proximity and for its interaction with the Solar System. This volume nearly coincides with a region of space known as the [[Local Bubble]], which is characterized by a lack of dense, cold clouds. It forms a cavity in the [[Orion Arm]] of the Milky Way galaxy, with dense molecular clouds lying along the borders, such as those in the [[constellation]]s of [[Ophiuchus]] and [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]. (The actual distance to the border of this cavity varies from 60 to 250&amp;nbsp;pc or more.) This volume contains about 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; stars and the local interstellar gas counterbalances the [[Stellar-wind bubble|astrospheres]] that surround these stars, with the volume of each sphere varying depending on the local density of the interstellar medium. The Local Bubble contains dozens of warm interstellar clouds with temperatures of up to 7,000&amp;nbsp;K and radii of 0.5–5&amp;nbsp;pc.&lt;ref name=redfield2006/&gt;

When stars are moving at sufficiently high [[peculiar velocities]], their astrospheres can generate [[bow shock]]s as they collide with the interstellar medium. For decades it was assumed that the Sun had a bow shock. In 2012, data from [[Interstellar Boundary Explorer|Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX)]] and NASA's [[Voyager program|Voyager]] probes showed that the Sun's bow shock does not exist. Instead, these authors argue that a [[Mach number|subsonic]] bow wave defines the transition from the solar wind flow to the interstellar medium.&lt;ref name=bow_science/&gt;&lt;ref name=bow/&gt; A bow shock is the third boundary of an astrosphere after the [[Heliosphere#Termination shock|termination shock]] and the astropause (called the heliopause in the Solar System).&lt;ref name=bow/&gt;

[[File:LH 95.jpg|thumb|right|[[LH 95|A]] [[star]]-forming region in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]], perhaps the closest Galaxy to Earth's [[Milky Way]]]]
{{See also|Intracluster medium}}
Intergalactic space is the physical space between galaxies. Studies of the large scale distribution of galaxies show that the Universe has a foam-like structure, with [[Galaxy groups and clusters|clusters and groups of galaxies]] lying along filaments that occupy about a tenth of the total space. The remainder forms huge voids that are mostly empty of galaxies. Typically, a [[Void (astronomy)|void]] spans a distance of (10–40) ''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Mpc, where ''h'' is the [[Hubble constant]] in units of {{nowrap|100 km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Mpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.{{sfn|Wszolek|2013|p=67}}

Surrounding and stretching between galaxies, there is a [[rarefaction|rarefied]] plasma&lt;ref name=jafelice_opher1992/&gt; that is organized in a [[galaxy filament|galactic filamentary]] structure.&lt;ref name=wadsley2002/&gt; This material is called the intergalactic medium (IGM). The density of the IGM is 5–200 times the average density of the Universe.&lt;ref name="apj_714_1715"/&gt; It consists mostly of ionized hydrogen; i.e. a plasma consisting of equal numbers of electrons and protons. As gas falls into the intergalactic medium from the voids, it heats up to temperatures of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K to 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K,&lt;ref name=baas41_908/&gt; which is high enough so that collisions between atoms have enough energy to cause the bound electrons to escape from the hydrogen nuclei; this is why the IGM is ionized. At these temperatures, it is called the [[warm–hot intergalactic medium]] (WHIM). (Although the plasma is very hot by terrestrial standards, 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; K is often called "warm" in astrophysics.) Computer simulations and observations indicate that up to half of the atomic matter in the Universe might exist in this warm–hot, rarefied state.&lt;ref name="apj_714_1715" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ssr134_1_141/&gt;&lt;ref name="apjs_182_378"/&gt; When gas falls from the filamentary structures of the WHIM into the galaxy clusters at the intersections of the cosmic filaments, it can heat up even more, reaching temperatures of 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K and above in the so-called intracluster medium.&lt;ref name="apj546_100"/&gt;

[[File:As08-16-2593.jpg|right|thumb|The first image taken of the entire Earth by astronauts was shot during the [[Apollo 8]] mission|alt=An blue-white disk against a black background. Brown areas of ground are visible in some areas through openings in the swirling white clouds. The lower left of the disk is in partial shadow.]]

For the majority of human history, space was explored by observations made from the Earth's surface—initially with the unaided eye and then with the telescope. Prior to the advent of reliable rocket technology, the closest that humans had come to reaching outer space was through the use of balloon flights. In 1935, the U.S. ''[[Explorer II]]'' manned balloon flight had reached an altitude of {{Convert|22|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=ssr13_2_199/&gt; This was greatly exceeded in 1942 when the third launch of the German [[V-2 rocket|A-4 rocket]] climbed to an altitude of about {{Convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}}. In 1957, the unmanned satellite [[Sputnik 1]] was launched by a Russian [[R-7 Semyorka|R-7 rocket]], achieving Earth orbit at an altitude of {{Convert|215|-|939|km|mi}}.{{sfn|O'Leary|2009|pp=209–224}} This was followed by the first human spaceflight in 1961, when [[Yuri Gagarin]] was sent into orbit on [[Vostok 1]]. The first humans to escape low-Earth orbit were [[Frank Borman]], [[Jim Lovell]] and [[William Anders]] in 1968 on board the U.S. [[Apollo 8]], which achieved lunar orbit{{sfn|Harrison|2002|pp=60–63}} and reached a maximum distance of {{Convert|377349|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Earth.{{sfn|Orloff|2001}}

The first spacecraft to reach escape velocity was the Soviet [[Luna 1]], which performed a fly-by of the Moon in 1959.{{sfn|Hardesty|Eisman|Krushchev|2008|pp=89–90}} In 1961, [[Venera 1]] became the first planetary probe. It revealed the presence of the solar wind and performed the first fly-by of [[Venus]], although contact was lost before reaching Venus. The first successful planetary mission was the 1962 fly-by of Venus by [[Mariner 2]].{{sfn|Collins|2007|p=86}} The first fly-by of Mars was by [[Mariner 4]] in 1964. Since that time, unmanned spacecraft have successfully examined each of the Solar System's planets, as well their moons and many [[minor planet]]s and comets. They remain a fundamental tool for the exploration of outer space, as well as observation of the Earth.{{sfn|Harris|2008|pp=7, 68–69}} In August 2012, ''[[Voyager 1]]'' became the first man-made object to leave the Solar System and enter [[interstellar space]].&lt;ref name="mike_wall"/&gt;

The absence of air makes outer space an ideal location for astronomy at all wavelengths of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. This is evidenced by the spectacular pictures sent back by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], allowing light from more than 13&amp;nbsp;billion years ago—almost to the time of the Big Bang—to be observed.&lt;ref name=hubblesite_cosmicdawn /&gt; However, not every location in space is ideal for a telescope. The [[Interplanetary dust cloud|interplanetary zodiacal dust]] emits a diffuse near-infrared radiation that can mask the emission of faint sources such as extrasolar planets. Moving an [[infrared telescope]] out past the dust increases its effectiveness.&lt;ref name=esa105/&gt; Likewise, a site like the [[Daedalus (crater)|Daedalus crater]] on the [[far side of the Moon]] could shield a [[radio telescope]] from the [[Electromagnetic interference|radio frequency interference]] that hampers Earth-based observations.&lt;ref name=maccone2001/&gt;

Unmanned spacecraft in Earth orbit are an essential technology of modern civilization. They allow direct monitoring of [[Weather satellite|weather conditions]], relay [[Communications satellite|long-range communications]] like television, provide a means of [[Satellite navigation|precise navigation]], and allow [[remote sensing]] of the Earth. The latter role serves a wide variety of purposes, including tracking soil moisture for agriculture, prediction of water outflow from seasonal snow packs, detection of diseases in plants and trees, and [[Spy satellite|surveillance]] of military activities.{{sfn|Razani|2012|pp=97–99}}

The deep vacuum of space could make it an attractive environment for certain industrial processes, such as those requiring ultraclean surfaces.&lt;ref name=chapman1991/&gt; However, like [[asteroid mining]], [[space manufacturing]] requires significant investment with little prospect of immediate return.&lt;ref name="IJA10_307"/&gt; An important factor in the total expense is the high cost of placing mass into Earth orbit: ${{Inflation|US|6000|2006|r=-3|fmt=c}}–{{Inflation|US|20000|2006|r=-3|fmt=c}} per kg in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to a 2006 estimate.&lt;ref name="jsr43_3_696"/&gt; Proposed concepts for addressing this issue include [[non-rocket spacelaunch]], [[momentum exchange tether]]s, and [[space elevators]].{{sfn|Bolonkin|2010|p=xv}}

[[Interstellar travel]] for a human crew remains at present only a theoretical possibility. The distances to the nearest stars will require new technological developments and the ability to safely sustain crews for journeys lasting several decades. For example, the [[Daedalus Project]] study, which proposed a spacecraft powered by the [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] of [[Deuterium]] and [[Helium-3|He&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]], would require 36 years to reach the nearby [[Alpha Centauri]] system. Other proposed interstellar propulsion systems include [[light sail]]s, [[Bussard ramjet|ramjets]], and [[beam-powered propulsion]]. More advanced propulsion systems could use [[antimatter]] as a fuel, potentially reaching [[Relativistic speed|relativistic velocities]].&lt;ref name=Crawford1990/&gt;

A '''biophysical  environment''' is a [[life|biotic]] and [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] surrounding of an [[organism]] or [[population]], and consequently includes the factors that have an influence in their survival, development, and evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Biology online| title=''Environment. Definition''| url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Environment| accessdate=2012-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A biophysical environment can vary in scale from [[microscopic]] to global in extent. It can also be subdivided according to its attributes. Examples include the [[marine environment]], the [[atmospheric environment]] and the [[Ecoregion#Terrestrial|terrestrial environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The term ''[[:wikt:environment|environment]]'' can refer to a singular global environment in relation to [[human]]ity, or a local biophysical environment, e.g. the UK's [[Environment Agency]].

==Life-environment interaction==
All life that has survived must have adapted to conditions of its environment. Temperature, light, humidity, soil nutrients, etc., all influence any species, within any environment. However life in turn modifies, in various forms, its conditions. Some long term modifications along the history of our planet have been significant, such as the incorporation of [[oxygen]] to the [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]]. This process consisted in the breakdown of [[carbon dioxide]] by [[anaerobic microorganism]]s that used the carbon in their [[metabolism]] and released the [[Atmospheric chemistry|oxygen to the atmosphere]]. This led to the existence of oxygen-based plant and animal life, the [[great oxygenation event]]. Other interactions are more immediate and simple, such as the smoothing effect that forests have on the temperature cycle, compared to neighboring unforested areas.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

[[Environmental science]] is the study of the interactions within the biophysical environment. Part of this [[Branches of science|scientific discipline]] is the investigation of the [[effect of human activity on the environment]]. [[Ecology]], a sub-discipline of biology and a part of environmental sciences, is often mistaken as a study of human induced effects on the environment. [[Environmental studies]] is a broader [[academic discipline]] that is the systematic study of interaction of humans with their environment. It is a broad field of study that includes the [[natural environment]], [[built environment]]s and [[social environment]]s.

Environmentalism is a broad social and philosophical movement that, in a large part, seeks to minimise and compensate the negative effect of human activity on the biophysical environment. The issues of concern for environmentalists usually relate to the natural environment with the more important ones being [[climate change]], [[species]] [[extinction]], [[pollution]], and [[old growth forest]] loss.

'''Regional policy''' aims to improve economic conditions in [[region]]s of relative disadvantage, either within a nation or within a supranational grouping such as the [[European Union]].

==Regional policy in the European Union==
{{main|Regional policy of the European Union}}
Although the European Union is one of the richest parts of the world, there are large internal disparities of income and opportunity between [[Region (Europe)|its regions]]. The May 2004 [[Enlargement of the European Union|Enlargement]], followed by accession of [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]] in January 2007, has widened these gaps. Regional policy transfers resources from richer to poorer regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regional Policy in the European Union|url=http://www.eubusiness.com/topics/finance/regional-policy-in-the-european-union/|publisher=EUbusiness.com|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument for regional policy is that it is both an instrument of financial solidarity and a powerful force for economic integration.

===Regional policy in Italy===
The major Italian experience of regional policy is the [[Cassa per il Mezzogiorno]], set up in the mid-1950s to foster economic development in [[southern Italy]]. Originally intended to last for six months, it survived until 1984.

New roads, irrigation projects and developments in infrastructure were built in an area where local communities had suffered seriously from poverty, de-population and high levels of emigration. Tourism projects attempted to exploit Calabria’s beaches.

===Regional policy in the United Kingdom===
UK regional policy was born during the [[economic depression]] of the 1930s, when heavy industries in the north were devastated. "Assisted Areas" were established, within which companies could acquire grants or capital allowances – known as Regional Selective Assistance (RSA) – in return for protecting jobs.

The overall pattern of policy changed little in the next forty years. Despite criticism by a 1970s Royal Commission that it was "Empiricism run mad; a game of hit and miss played with more enthusiasm than success",{{cn|date=May 2018}} governments of both parties maintained Assisted Areas. Under the 1980s [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] government, regional policy was significantly rolled back, with Assisted Areas substantially reduced in size.

The post-1997 [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] administration reorganised regional policy, with RSA replaced by [[Selective Finance for Investment]] in England and Scotland. UK policy has been subject to EU regional policy framework, with its strong injunctions against unfair competition (generally meaning state aid).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2564">'''WS-Policy''' is a specification that allows [[web services]] to use XML to advertise their policies (on [[WS-SecurityPolicy|security]], [[quality of service]], etc.) and for web service consumers to specify their policy requirements.

WS-Policy is a [[W3C]] recommendation as of September 2007.

WS-Policy represents a set of specifications that describe the capabilities and constraints of the security (and other business) policies on intermediaries and end points (for example, required security tokens, supported encryption algorithms, and privacy rules) and how to associate policies with services and end points.

==Policy Assertion==
Assertions can either be requirements put upon a web service or an advertisement of the policies of a web service.

==Operator tags==
Two "operators" (XML tags) are used to make statements about policy combinations:
*''wsp:ExactlyOne'' - asserts that only one child node must be satisfied.
*''wsp:All'' - asserts that all child nodes must be satisfied.

Logically, an empty ''wsp:All'' tag makes no assertions.

==Policy Intersection==
If both provider and consumer specify a policy, an effective policy will be computed which usually consists of the intersection of both policies. The new policy contains those assertions made by both sides which do not contradict each other. However, synonymous assertions are considered incompatible by a policy intersection. This can easily be explained by the fact that policy intersection is a syntactic approach, which does not incorporate the semantics of the assertions. Furthermore, it ignores the assertion parameters.

Opposed to what the name might suggest, a policy intersection is (although quite similar) not a set-intersection.

==Associated specifications==
*[http://www.w3.org/TR/ws-policy-attach/ WS-Policy - Attachment] specifies how to add policies to WSDL and UDDI.
*[[WS-SecurityPolicy]] specifies security policy assertions for [[WS-Security]], [[WS-Trust]] and [[WS-SecureConversation]].
*[[WS-Policy4MASC]] specifies management policies for Web services and their compositions.

In British research policy, the '''Haldane principle''' is the idea that decisions about what to spend research funds on should be made by researchers rather than politicians. It is named after [[Richard Burdon Haldane]], who in 1904 and from 1909 to 1918 chaired committees and commissions which recommended this policy.

==Overview==
The 1904 committee recommended the creation of the [[University Grants Committee (UK)|University Grants Committee]] which has evolved via the [[Universities Funding Council]] into the current higher education funding councils: [[Research Councils UK]], [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]], [[Scottish Funding Council]] and [[Higher Education Funding Council for Wales]].

In 1918 Haldane's committee produced the "Haldane Report".  The report suggested that research required by government departments could be separated into that required by specific departments and that which was more general.  It recommended that departments should oversee the specific research but the general research should be under the control of autonomous [[UK Research Councils|Research Councils]], which would be free from political and administrative pressures that might discourage research in certain areas.  The principle of the autonomy of the research councils is now referred to as the Haldane Principle. The first research council to be created as a result of the Haldane Report was the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]].

The principle has remained enshrined in British Government policy, but has been criticised and altered over the years.  In 1939 [[J.D. Bernal]] argued that social good was more important than researchers' freedom in deciding the direction of research.  [[Solly Zuckerman]] criticised it in 1971 for its artificial separation of basic and applied science, and the consequent elevation of the status of the former.

A major revision to the application of the Haldane Principle in British research funding came in the early 1970s with the Rothschild Report of 1971, and its implementation which transferred about 25% of the then Research Council funds, and the decisions on the research to be funded with them, back to government departments, a move later undone by Margaret Thatcher's government.

There is currently a debate about the extent to which the principle is still applied in practice.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-39078281 BBC 24 02 2017: Minister to enshrine protection for research independence]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Higher Education and Research Act 2017]], which merged the research councils and the research part of the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]] into [[UK Research and Innovation]], enacted the Haldane principle as section 103(3): ''The “Haldane principle” is the principle that decisions on individual research proposals are best taken following an evaluation of the quality and likely impact of the proposals (such as a peer review process).''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2017/29/section/103/enacted  Higher Education and Research Act 2017], legislation.gov.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''eightfold path''' is a method of [[policy analysis]] assembled by [[Eugene Bardach]], a professor at the [[Goldman School of Public Policy]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eugene Bardach {{!}} Emeritus Professor of Public Policy|url=https://gspp.berkeley.edu/directories/faculty/eugene-bardach|publisher=University of California at Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is outlined in his book ''A Practical Guide for Policy Analysis: The Eightfold Path to More Effective Problem Solving'', which is now in its fourth edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CQ Press: Book: A Practical Guide for Policy Analysis: The Eightfold Path to More Effective Problem Solving, 4th Edition, Eugene Bardach |url=http://www.cqpress.com/product/Bardach4e.html |publisher=CQ Press |accessdate=29 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010053147/http://www.cqpress.com/product/Bardach4e.html |archivedate=10 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book is commonly referenced in [[Policy|public policy]] and [[public administration]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of scholarly works referencing ''A Practical Guide for Policy Analysis''|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=4884126323094470718&amp;as_sdt=20005&amp;sciodt=0,9&amp;hl=en|publisher=Google Scholar|accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bardach's procedure is as follows:
# Define the problem
# Assemble some evidence
# Construct the alternatives
# Select the criteria
# Project the outcomes
# Confront the trade-offs
# Decide
# Tell your story

A possible ninth step, based on Bardach's own writing, might be "repeat steps 1 - 8 as necessary."

== The New York taxi driver test ==
The New York taxi driver test is a technique for evaluating the effectiveness of communication between policy makers and analysts. Bardach contends that policy explanations must be clear and down-to-earth enough for a taxi driver to be able to understand the premise during a trip through city streets. The New York taxi driver is presumed to be both a non-specialist and a tough customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bardach| first = Eugene| title = A practical guide for policy analysis: the eightfold path to more effective problem solving| year = 2000| publisher = Chatham House Publishers, Seven Bridges Press| isbn = 978-1-889119-29-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebriefings.ca/wordpress/?p%3D321 |accessdate=13 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712110533/http://www.ebriefings.ca/wordpress/?p=321 |archivedate=12 July 2011 |title=Digital Fishers – The Taxi Driver Pitch }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6637">'''Multifunctionality in agriculture''' (often simply ''multifunctionality'') refers to the numerous benefits that agricultural policies may provide for a country or region. Generally speaking, multifunctionality refers to the ''non-trade'' benefits of agriculture, that is, benefits other than commerce and food production.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/glossary_e/multifunctionality_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These include, in the WTO definition of multifunctionality, environmental protection, landscape preservation, rural employment, and food security.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/glossary_e/multifunctionality_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These can be broadly classified as benefits to society, culture, a national economy as a whole, national security, and other concerns. For example, in addition to providing food and plant-derived products for the population, agriculture may also provide jobs for rural people and contribute to the viability of the area, create a more stable food supply, and provide other desired environmental and rural outputs.&lt;ref&gt;“Multifunctionality,” &lt;u&gt;OECD Department for Trade and Agriculture&lt;/u&gt;, OECD.org, 20 July 2007 &lt;http://www.oecd.org/department/0,3355,en_2649_33779_1_1_1_1_1,00.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multifunctionality and agricultural policies==
The numerous externalities, both positive and negative, which are associated with agriculture are important considerations for policy makers. Sometimes current agricultural practices and markets produce too much of an undesired effect or not enough of a desired one. Governments may step in to correct such market failures with policies designed to either encourage or discourage a certain practice. However, individual policies may carry consequences for other policies and for other countries. Such policies are therefore a major topic of discussion in the international community.&lt;ref&gt;“Multifunctionality: About,”&lt;u&gt;OECD Department for Trade and Agriculture&lt;/u&gt;, OECD.org, 20 July 2007 &lt;http://www.oecd.org/about/0,3347,en_2649_33779_1_1_1_1_1,00.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Removing [[protectionist]] policies on agriculture is one step that may need to be taken for a country to maximize positive externalities, minimize negative ones and make sure that the mixture of outputs derived from agriculture corresponds to the needs of society.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;u&gt;Multifunctionality: Towards an Analytical Framework&lt;/u&gt;, Paris: OECD Publications, 2001, &lt;u&gt;SourceOECD&lt;/u&gt;, 20 July 2007 http://caliban.sourceoecd.org/vl=22058302/cl=14/nw=1/rpsv/cgi-bin/fulltextew.pl?prpsv=/ij/oecdthemes/99980002/v2001n6/s1/p1l.idx (14).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, removing agricultural supports is often cause for consternation among public officials, who may predict the loss of certain positive externalities of the policies already in place. At the same time, officials may fear the implementation of new market protections in other countries which are trying to promote the production of such outputs of agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;u&gt;Multifunctionality: The Policy Implications&lt;/u&gt;, Paris: OECD Publications, 2003, &lt;u&gt;SourceOECD&lt;/u&gt;, 20 July 2007 &lt;http://caliban.sourceoecd.org/vl=22058302/cl=14/nw=1/rpsv/cgi-bin/fulltextew.pl?prpsv=/ij/oecdthemes/99980002/v2001n6/s1/p1l.idx&gt;.(8)&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, advocates for free trade, such as [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] recommend that countries reduce as much as possible their agricultural protections and institute policies which specifically target the production of the positive non-commodity outputs.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;u&gt;Multifunctionality: Towards an Analytical Framework&lt;/u&gt;, Paris: OECD Publications, 2001, &lt;u&gt;SourceOECD&lt;/u&gt;, 20 July 2007 http://caliban.sourceoecd.org/vl=22058302/cl=14/nw=1/rpsv/cgi-bin/fulltextew.pl?prpsv=/ij/oecdthemes/99980002/v2001n6/s1/p1l.idx (14).&lt;/ref&gt;

To help countries formulate their agricultural policies, [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] has established a framework for analyzing non-commodity outputs of agricultural activities.&lt;ref&gt;“Multifunctionality: About,”&lt;u&gt;OECD Department for Trade and Agriculture&lt;/u&gt;, OECD.org, 20 July 2007 &lt;http://www.oecd.org/about/0,3347,en_2649_33779_1_1_1_1_1,00.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; When analyzing the multifunctionality of agriculture and the appropriate policies to implement, there are several concepts that need to be considered. The first of these is jointness, or the extent to which the intended agricultural product and the incidental non-commodity outputs of agricultural activity are linked. The production of some non-commodity outputs may be inseparable from agricultural commodity outputs while others may be produced independently of agricultural activity. The goal is to separate agricultural commodities and non-commodity outputs as much as possible. The next issue to be addressed is whether or not the production or non-production of the non-commodity output in question constitutes a market failure. If there is no market failure, there is no need for a policy to correct it. Finally policy makers should examine the characteristics of the output in question since it may have both a degree of market failure and jointness associated with it. After considering the matter from these three perspectives, policy makers may find non-governmental ways of addressing dealing with non-commodity outputs or make changes in their agricultural policies.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;u&gt;Multifunctionality: The Policy Implications&lt;/u&gt;, Paris: OECD Publications, 2003, &lt;u&gt;SourceOECD&lt;/u&gt;, 20 July 2007 &lt;http://caliban.sourceoecd.org/vl=22058302/cl=14/nw=1/rpsv/cgi-bin/fulltextew.pl?prpsv=/ij/oecdthemes/99980002/v2001n6/s1/p1l.idx&gt; (9-11).&lt;/ref&gt;

==WTO trade discussions==

In agricultural trade discussions in the WTO, the EU and Japan, among others, argue that multifunctionality justifies continued protection and subsidization of agriculture.  The United States and the [[Cairns Group]] argue that support of multifunctionality should be specific, targeted, and provided in a non-trade distorting manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf CRS Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition - Order Code 97-905] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810044532/http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf |date=2011-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{globalize|date=February 2016}}
'''Health administration''' or '''healthcare administration''' is the field relating to leadership, management, and administration of [[public health]] systems, [[health care systems]], [[hospital]]s, and [[hospital network]]s.

==Terminology==
Health systems management or health care systems management describes the leadership and general management of [[hospitals]], [[hospital network]]s, and/or [[health care systems]].  In international use, the term refers to management at all levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/management/en|title=World Health Organization - Management|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212002640/http://www.who.int/topics/management/en/|archivedate=2009-02-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, management of a single institution (e.g. a hospital) is also referred to as "medical and health services management",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov|title=Bureau of Labor Statistics|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423042046/http://www.bls.gov/|archivedate=2013-04-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "healthcare management", or "health administration".

Health systems management ensures that specific outcomes are attained, that departments within a health facility are running smoothly, that the right people are in the right jobs, that people know what is expected of them, that resources are used efficiently and that all departments are working towards a common goal.

==Hospital administrators==
Hospital administrators are individuals or groups of people who act as the central point of control within hospitals. These individuals may be previous or current [[clinician]]s, or individuals with other backgrounds. There are two types of administrators, generalists and specialists. Generalists are individuals who are responsible for managing or helping to manage an entire facility. Specialists are individuals who are responsible for the efficient operations of a specific department such as policy analysis, finance, accounting, budgeting, human resources, or marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mshealthcareers.com/careers/healthcareadmin.htm |title=Health Care Administrator |accessdate=11 September 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702233306/http://www.mshealthcareers.com/careers/healthcareadmin.htm |archivedate=2 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported in September 2014, that the United States spends roughly $218 billion per year on hospital's administration costs, which is equivalent to 1.43 percent of the total [[United States economy|U.S. economy]]. Hospital administration has grown as a percent of the U.S. economy from .9 percent in 2000 to 1.43 percent in 2012, according to ''Health Affairs''. In 11 different countries, hospitals allocate approximately 12 percent of their budget toward administrative costs. In the United States, hospitals spend 25 percent on administrative costs.&lt;ref name="Kliff-administractive costs"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kliff|first1=Sarah|title=$1.43 of every $100 in America goes toward hospital administration|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/9/15/6151861/1-43-of-every-100-in-america-towards-hospital-paperwork|publisher=Vox|accessdate=16 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915211307/http://www.vox.com/2014/9/15/6151861/1-43-of-every-100-in-america-towards-hospital-paperwork|archivedate=15 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training and organizations==

===Associated qualifications===
Health care management is usually studied through healthcare administration&lt;ref name="NE"&gt;[http://www.newenglandcollegeonline.com/bachelors-degree-healthcare-administration/ "Bachelor's Degree in Healthcare Administration"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208031955/http://www.newenglandcollegeonline.com/bachelors-degree-healthcare-administration/ |date=2013-02-08 }} ''[[New England College]]''&lt;/ref&gt; or healthcare management&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.floridatechonline.com/undergraduate-ba-healthcare-management-degree/|title=Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration Healthcare Management - Online Healthcare Management Degree|author=|date=|website=Florida Tech Online|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820105146/http://www.floridatechonline.com/undergraduate-ba-healthcare-management-degree/|archivedate=2013-08-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; programs in a business school or, in some institutions, in a school of public health.

====North America====
Although many colleges and universities are offering a [[bachelor's degree]] in healthcare administration or human resources,&lt;ref name="NE" /&gt; a [[master's degree]] is considered the "standard credential"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos014.htm|title=Bureau of Labor Statistics - Occupational Outlook Handbook entry|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105224955/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos014.htm|archivedate=2009-01-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for most health administrators in the United States. Research and academic-based doctorate level degrees, such as the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Health Administration and the Doctor of Health Administration (DHA) degree, prepare health care professionals to turn their clinical or administrative experiences into opportunities to develop new knowledge and practice, teach, shape public policy and/or lead complex organizations.  There are multiple recognized degree types that are considered equivalent from the perspective of professional preparation.

The [[Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education]] (CAHME) is the [[Educational accreditation|accrediting body]] overseeing master's-level programs in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] on behalf of the [[United States Department of Education]]. It accredits several degree program types, including Master of Hospital Administration (MHA), [[Master of Health Administration|Master of Health Services Administration]] (MHSA), [[Master of Business Administration|Master of Business Administration in Hospital Management]] (MBA-HM), [[Master of Health Administration]] (MHA), [[Master of Public Health]] (MPH, MSPH, MSHPM), [[Master of Science]] (MS-HSM, MS-HA), and [[Master of Public Administration]] (MPA).

====Nepal====
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
Health care management study is a new discipline in Nepal. [[Pokhara University]] offers a Hospital Management course. National Open College launched a four-year Bachelor's level (BHCM) course in September 2000 with an enrolment of 40 students, and the next year it also started a one-year postgraduate diploma (PGDHCM) and a two-year master's course (MHCM) in health care management. Nobel College at Sinamangal has also been offering a Bachelor’s level (BHCM) course since 2006. MD Hospital administration (MDHA) and Master in Hospital Management (MHM) are being started from 2013. It is uncertain how many citizens of Nepal are gaining healthcare management qualifications in other countries. There is an absence of  professional organization and regulation in the health care management profession in Nepal.

=== Professional organizations ===
There are a variety of different professional associations related to health systems management, which can be subcategorized as either personal or institutional membership groups. Personal membership groups are joined by individuals, and typically have individual skills and career development as their focus. Larger personal membership groups include the [[Healthcare Financial Management Association]], and the [[Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society]]. Institutional membership groups are joined by organizations; whereas they typically focus on organizational effectiveness, and may also include data-sharing agreements and other medical related or administrative practice sharing vehicles for member organizations. Prominent examples include the [[American Hospital Association]] and the University Healthsystems Consortium.

==History==

Early hospital administrators were called patient directors or superintendents. At the time, many were nurses who had taken on administrative responsibilities. Over half of the members of the [[American Hospital Association]] were graduate nurses in 1916. Other superintendents were medical doctors, laymen and members of the clergy. 
In the United States, the first degree granting program in the United States was established at [[Marquette University]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]. By 1927, the first two students received their degrees. The original idea is credited to Father Moulinier, associated with the Catholic Hospital Association.&lt;ref&gt;Haddock, Cynthia Carter [http://www.healthmanagementcareers.org/haddock_ch01.pdf "A Brief History of Healthcare Management"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904050920/http://www.healthmanagementcareers.org/haddock_ch01.pdf |date=2012-09-04 }}, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern health systems management program was established in 1934 at the University of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gphap.uchicago.edu/aboutgphap.shtml|title=University of Chicago - Graduate Program in Health Administration and Policy|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620062442/http://gphap.uchicago.edu/aboutgphap.shtml|archivedate=2010-06-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, programs were completed in two years – one year of formal graduate study and one year of practicing internship.  In 1958, the Sloan program at [[Cornell University]] began offering a special program requiring two years of formal study,&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, R. (1999).

Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which remains the dominant structure in the United States and Canada today (see also "Academic Preparation").

Health systems management has been described as a "hidden" health profession&lt;ref&gt;Haddock, C. C., &amp; McLean, R. D. (2002). "Careers in Healthcare Management: How to Find your Path and Follow It."  Chicago: Health Administration Press.&lt;/ref&gt; because of the relatively low-profile role managers take in health systems, in comparison to direct-care professions such as nursing and medicine.  However the visibility of the management profession within healthcare has been rising in recent years, due largely to the widespread problems developed countries are having in balancing cost, access, and quality in their hospitals and health systems.&lt;ref&gt;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2006).

[[File:Overton Window diagram.svg |thumb|right|An illustration of the Overton Window, along with Treviño's degrees of acceptance]]
The '''Overton window''' is the range of ideas tolerated in [[public sphere|public discourse]], also known as the '''window of discourse'''. The term is named after political scientist [[Joseph P. Overton]], who claimed that an idea's political viability depends mainly on whether it falls within a range acceptable to the public, rather than on politicians' individual preferences.&lt;ref name="mackinac2"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mackinac.org/bio.aspx?ID=12 |title=Joseph Overton biography and article index |publisher=[[Mackinac Center for Public Policy]] |access-date=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mackinac1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mackinac.org/12887 |title=A Brief Explanation of the Overton Window |last=Lehman |first=Joseph  |publisher=[[Mackinac Center for Public Policy]] |access-date=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Overton, the window contains the range of policies that a politician can recommend without appearing too extreme to gain or keep public office in the current climate of [[public opinion]].

==Summary==
Overton described a spectrum from "more free" to "less free" with regard to government intervention, oriented vertically on an axis, to avoid comparison with the left-right political spectrum.&lt;ref name="Glenn"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mackinac.org/11398 |title=Glenn Beck Highlights Mackinac Center's "Overton Window" |last=Lehman |first=Joseph G. |date=November 23, 2009 |publisher=[[Mackinac Center for Public Policy]] |access-date=April 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the spectrum moves or expands, an idea at a given location may become more or less politically acceptable. Political commentator [[Joshua Treviño]] postulated that the degrees of acceptance of public ideas are roughly:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/5/9/205251/2950 |title=Why the Right-Wing Gets It--and Why Dems Don't [UPDATED] |last=thereisnospoon |date=May 10, 2006 |website=[[Daily Kos]] |access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unthinkable
* Radical
* Acceptable
* Sensible
* Popular
* Policy

The Overton window is an approach to identifying which ideas define the domain of acceptability within a democracy's possible governmental policies. Proponents of policies outside the window seek to convince or persuade the public in order to move and/or expand the window. Proponents of current policies, or similar ones, within the window seek to convince people that policies outside it should be deemed unacceptable.

After Overton's death, others have examined the concept of adjusting the window by the deliberate promotion of ideas outside of it, or "outer fringe" ideas, with the intention of making less fringe ideas acceptable by comparison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2009/11/5/800804/-Morning-Feature:-Crazy-Like-a-Fox |title=Morning Feature: Crazy Like a Fox? |last=NCrissieB |date=November 5, 2009 |website=[[Daily Kos]] |access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[door-in-the-face technique|"door-in-the-face" technique]] of persuasion is similar.

==Historical precedents==
{{original research|section|date=March 2017}}
The idea echoes several earlier expressions, the most recent and similarly academic being [[Hallin's spheres]]. In his 1986 book ''The Uncensored War'',&lt;ref name="DH"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Uncensored War: The Media and Vietnam.|last=Hallin|first=Daniel|publisher=Oxford University press|year=1986|isbn=978-0-19-503814-9|location=New York|pages=116–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; communication scholar Daniel C. Hallin posits three areas of media coverage into which a topic may fall. The areas are diagrammed as concentric circles called spheres. From innermost to outermost they are the sphere of consensus, the sphere of legitimate controversy, and the sphere of deviance. Proposals and positions can be placed at varying degrees of distance from the metaphorical center, and political actors can fight over and help change these positions.

Hallin's theory is developed and applied primarily as a theory that explains varying levels of objectivity in media coverage, but it also accounts for the ongoing contest among media and other political actors about what counts as legitimate disagreement, potentially leading to changes in the boundaries between spheres. As one study that applies Hallin's theory explains, "the borders between the three spheres are dynamic, depending on the political climate and on the editorial line of the various media outlets".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Figenschou |first=Tine Ustad |last2=Beyer |first2=Audun |date=October 2014 |title=The Limits of the Debate How the Oslo Terror Shook the Norwegian Immigration Debate |url=http://hij.sagepub.com/content/19/4/430.short |journal=The International Journal of Press/Politics |volume=19 |issue=4 |page=435 |doi=10.1177/1940161214542954}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the idea also captures the tug-of-war over the boundaries between normal and deviant political discourse.

An idea similar to the Overton window was expressed by [[Anthony Trollope]] in 1868 in his novel ''[[Phineas Finn]]'':

{{quote|"Many who before regarded legislation on the subject as chimerical, will now fancy that it is only dangerous, or perhaps not more than difficult. And so in time it will come to be looked on as among the things possible, then among the things probable;—and so at last it will be ranged in the list of those few measures which the country requires as being absolutely needed. That is the way in which public opinion is made."

"It is no loss of time," said Phineas, "to have taken the first great step in making it."

"The first great step was taken long ago," said Mr. Monk,—"taken by men who were looked upon as revolutionary demagogues, almost as traitors, because they took it. But it is a great thing to take any step that leads us onwards."}}

In his "West India Emancipation" speech at Canandaigua, New York, in 1857,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.blackpast.org/1857-frederick-douglass-if-there-no-struggle-there-no-progress |title=(1857) Frederick Douglass, "If There Is No Struggle, There Is No Progress" |website=The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed |language=en |access-date=May 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] leader [[Frederick Douglass]] described how public opinion limits the ability of those in power to act with impunity:

{{quote|Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both. The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6736">'''Culture change''' is a term used in [[public policy]] making that emphasizes the influence of [[cultural capital]] on individual and community behavior. It has been sometimes called repositioning of culture,&lt;Ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/13668803.2014.981506|title = Repositioning culture for development: Women and development in a Nigerian rural community| journal=Community, Work &amp; Family| volume=18| issue=3| pages=334–350|year = 2015|last1 = Chigbu|first1 = Uchendu Eugene}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means the reconstruction of the cultural concept of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chigbu|first1=Uchendu Eugene|title=Repositioning culture for development: women and development in a Nigerian rural community|journal=Community, Work &amp; Family|date=2015|volume=18|issue=3|pages=334–350|doi=10.1080/13668803.2014.981506}}&lt;/ref&gt; It places stress on the social and cultural capital determinants of decision making and the manner in which these interact with other factors like the availability of information or the financial incentives facing individuals to drive behavior.
[[Image:culture change model.jpg|thumb|Model of culture change]] 

These cultural capital influences include the role of parenting, families and close associates; organizations such as schools and workplaces; communities and neighborhoods; and wider social influences such as the media. It is argued that this cultural capital manifests into specific values, attitudes or social norms which in turn guide the behavioral ''intentions'' that individuals adopt in regard to particular decisions or courses of action. These behavioral intentions interact with other factors driving behavior such as financial incentives, regulation and legislation, or levels of information, to drive actual behavior and ultimately feed back into underlying cultural capital.

In general, cultural stereotypes present great resistance to change and to their own redefinition. Culture, often appears fixed to the observer at any one point in time because cultural mutations occur incrementally.&lt;ref&gt;P.E. Petrakis, P.C. Kostis (2013) “[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053535713000218#! Economic Growth and Cultural Change]”, Journal of Socio-Economics, Issue C, Vol. 47, pp. 147-157, DOI 10.1016/j.socec.2013.02.011.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural change is a long-term process. Policymakers need to make a great effort to improve some basics aspects of a society’s cultural traits.

==Achieving culture change==
The term is used by Knott et al. of the [[Prime Minister's Strategy Unit]] in the publication: ''[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100125070726/http://cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/strategy/assets/achieving_culture_change.pdf Achieving Culture Change: A Policy Framework]'' (Knott et al., 2008). The paper sets out how public policy can achieve social and cultural change through 'downstream' interventions including fiscal incentives, legislation, regulation and information provision and also 'upstream' interventions such as parenting, peer and mentoring programs, or development of social and community networks.

The key concepts the paper is based on include:

* ''Cultural capital'' - such as the attitudes, values, aspirations and sense of self-efficacy which influence behavior. Cultural capital is itself influenced by behavior over time
* The shifting ''social zeitgeist'' - whereby social norms and values that predominate within the cultural capital in society evolve in over time
* The process by which political narrative and new ideas and innovations shift the social zeitgeist over time within the constraint of the 'elastic band' of public opinion
* The process of ''behavioral normalization'' - whereby behavior and actions pass through into social and cultural norms (for example, Knott et al. argue that the UK experience of seat belt enforcement established and reinforced this as a social norm)
* The use of [[customer insight]]
* The importance of tailoring policy programmes around an ecological model of human behavior to account for how policy will interact with cultural capital and affect it over time

Knott et al. use examples from a range of policy areas to demonstrate how the culture change framework can be applied to policymaking. For example:

* To encourage educational aspiration they recommend more use of early years and parenting interventions, an improved childhood offer, and development of positive narratives on education as well as integrated advisory systems, financial assistance and targeted social marketing approaches.
* To promote healthy living and personal responsibility they recommend building healthy living into community infrastructure, building partnerships with schools and employers, more one-to-one support for wellbeing alongside use of regulation and legislation on unhealthy products, provision of robust health information and health marketing to promote adaptive forms of behaviour.
* To develop environmentally sustainable norms they recommend reinforcing sustainability throughout policy narratives, using schools and the voluntary sector to promote environmental messages, development of infrastructure that make sustainable choices easy, together with a wider package of measures on fiscal incentives, regulation, advisory services and coalition movements.

'''Security policy''' is a definition of what it means to ''be secure'' for a [[system]], organization or other entity.  For an organization, it addresses the constraints on behavior of its members as well as constraints imposed on adversaries by mechanisms such as doors, locks, keys and walls.  For systems, the security policy addresses constraints on functions and flow among them, constraints on access by external systems and adversaries including programs and access to data by people.  

==Significance==
If it is important to be secure, then it is important to be sure all of the security policy is enforced by mechanisms that are strong enough.  There are many organized methodologies and risk assessment strategies to assure completeness of security policies and assure that they are completely enforced.  In complex systems, such as [[information systems]], policies can be decomposed into sub-policies to facilitate the allocation of security mechanisms to enforce sub-policies.  However, this practice has pitfalls.  It is too easy to simply go directly to the sub-policies, which are essentially the rules of operation and dispense with the top level policy.  That gives the false sense that the rules of operation address some overall definition of security when they do not.  Because it is so difficult to think clearly with completeness about security, rules of operation stated as "sub-policies" with no "super-policy" usually turn out to be rambling rules that fail to enforce anything with completeness.  Consequently, a top-level security policy is essential to any serious security scheme and sub-policies and rules of operation are meaningless without it.

'''Science policy''' is concerned with the allocation of resources for the conduct of science towards the goal of best serving the public interest.  Topics include the [[funding of science]], the careers of scientists, and the translation of scientific discoveries into [[technological innovation]] to promote [[commercial product development]], [[Competition (companies)|competitiveness]], [[economic growth]] and [[economic development]].  Science policy focuses on knowledge production and role of knowledge networks, collaborations and the complex distributions of expertise, equipment and know-how. Understanding the processes and organizational context of generating novel and innovative science and engineering ideas is a core concern of science policy. Science policy topics include [[weapons development]], [[health care]] and [[environmental monitoring]].

Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve science.  A large and complex web of factors influences the development of science and
engineering that includes government science policy makers, private firms (including both national and multi-national firms), social
movements, media, non-governmental organizations, universities, and other research institutions. In addition, science policy is increasingly international as defined by the global operations of firms and research institutions as well as by the collaborative networks of non-governmental
organizations and of the nature of scientific inquiry itself. 

==History==
{{main|History of science policy}}

[[State (polity)|State]] [[policy]] has influenced the funding of [[public works]] and science for thousands of years, dating at least from the time of the [[Mohists]], who inspired the study of logic during the period of the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]], and the study of defensive fortifications during the [[Warring States period]] in China. General levies of labor and grain were collected to fund great public works in China, including the accumulation of grain for distribution in times of famine,&lt;ref&gt;Francesca Bray (1984), ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]'' '''VI.2''' '''''Agriculture'''''&lt;/ref&gt; for the building of levees to control flooding by the great rivers of China, for the building of canals and locks to connect rivers of China, some of which flowed in opposite directions to each other,&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Needham]], ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and for  the building of bridges across these rivers. These projects required a [[civil service]], the [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholars]], some of whom demonstrated great mastery of [[hydraulics]].

In Italy, Galileo noted that individual taxation of minute amounts could fund large sums to the State, which could then fund his research on the trajectory of cannonballs, noting that "each individual soldier was being paid from coin collected by a general tax of pennies and farthings, while even a million of gold would not suffice to pay the entire army."&lt;ref&gt;[[Galileo]] (1638) [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=753&amp;chapter=109891&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 Two New Sciences], Salviati, first day of the dialogs&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Great Britain]], [[Lord Chancellor]] [[Sir Francis Bacon]] had a formative effect on science policy with his identification of "experiments of .. light, more penetrating into nature [than what others know]",&lt;ref&gt;[[Sir Francis Bacon]] (1624). ''[[New Atlantis]]''&lt;/ref&gt; which today we call the [[crucial experiment]].  Governmental approval of [[the Royal Society]] recognized a [[scientific community]] which exists to this day. British prizes for research spurred the development of an accurate, portable [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]], which directly enabled reliable navigation and sailing on the high seas, and also funded [[Charles Babbage|Babbage]]'s computer.

The professionalization of science, begun in the nineteenth century, was partly enabled by the creation of scientific organizations such as the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]], and State funding of universities of their respective nations. In the United States, a member of the National Academy of Sciences can sponsor a Direct Submission for publication in the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/site/misc/iforc.shtml#submission PNAS Submission Guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt; ''PNAS'' serves as a channel to recognize research of importance to at least one member of the National Academy of Sciences.

Public policy can directly affect the funding of [[capital equipment]], intellectual infrastructure for industrial research, by providing tax incentives to those organizations who fund research. [[Vannevar Bush]], director of the office of scientific research and development for the U.S. government in July 1945, wrote "Science is a proper concern of government"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm Vannevar Bush (July 1945), "Science, the Endless Frontier"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Vannevar Bush directed the forerunner of the [[National Science Foundation]], and his writings directly inspired researchers to invent the [[hyperlink]] and the [[computer mouse]].  The [[DARPA]] initiative to support computing was the impetus for the [[Internet Protocol]] stack. In the same way that scientific consortiums like [[CERN]] for [[high-energy physics]] have a commitment to public knowledge, access to this public knowledge in physics led directly to CERN's sponsorship of development of the [[World Wide Web]] and standard Internet access for all.

==Philosophies of science policy==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2010}}

===Basic versus applied research===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}

The programs that are funded are often divided into four basic categories: [[basic research]], [[applied research]], [[Research and development|development]], and facilities and equipment.&lt;ref name="AAASpresentation"&gt;{{cite web|last=Clemins|first=Patrick|title=R&amp;D in the President's FY 2011 Budget|url=http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/presentations/|accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed (lead)|date=December 2014}}  [[Translational research]] is a newer concept that seeks to bridge the gap between basic science and practical applications.

Basic science attempts to stimulate breakthroughs. Breakthroughs often lead to an explosion of new technologies and approaches.  Once the basic result is developed, it is widely published; however conversion into a practical product is left for the free market.  However, many governments have developed risk-taking research and development organizations to take basic theoretical research over the edge into practical [[engineering]].  In the [[United States|U.S.]], this function is performed by [[DARPA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.space.com/29273-what-is-darpa.html|title=What Is DARPA?|last=Howell|first=Elizabeth|last2=April 30|first2=Space com Contributor {{!}}|website=Space.com|access-date=2019-02-08|last3=ET|first3=2015 12:46am}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, technology development is a policy in which engineering, the application of science, is supported rather than basic science.  The emphasis is usually given to projects that increase important strategic or commercial engineering knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}  The most extreme{{dubious|date=December 2014}} success story is doubtless the [[Manhattan Project]] that developed [[nuclear weapon]]s.  Another remarkable success story was the "X-vehicle" studies that gave the US a lasting lead in aerospace technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.darpa.mil/program/ground-x-vehicle-technologies|title=Ground X-Vehicle Technologies (GXV-T)|website=www.darpa.mil|access-date=2019-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These exemplify two disparate approaches: The Manhattan Project was huge, and spent unblinkingly on the most risky alternative approaches.  The project members believed that failure would result in their enslavement or destruction by [[Nazi Germany]].  Each X-project built an aircraft whose only purpose was to develop a particular technology.  The plan was to build a few cheap aircraft of each type, fly a test series, often to the destruction of an aircraft, and never design an aircraft for a practical mission.  The only mission was technology development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2016/11/16/the-nsas-spy-hub-in-new-york-hidden-in-plain-sight/|title=Titanpointe: The NSA’s Spy Hub in New York, Hidden in Plain Sight|last=Gallagher|first=Ryan|last2=Moltke|first2=Henrik|date=2016-11-16|website=The Intercept|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of high-profile technology developments have failed.  The US Space Shuttle failed to meet its cost or flight schedule goals.  Most observers explain the project as over constrained: the cost goals too aggressive, the technology and mission too underpowered and undefined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/02/02/why-did-nasa-end-the-space-shuttle-program/|title=Why Did NASA End The Space Shuttle Program?|last=Quora|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese [[fifth generation computer systems project]] met every technological goal, but failed to produce commercially important [[artificial intelligence]].  Many observers{{Who|date=December 2014}} believe that the Japanese tried to force engineering beyond available science by brute investment.  Half the amount spent on basic research rather might have produced ten times the result.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

=== Utilitarian versus monumental science policy ===
[[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian]] policies prioritize scientific projects that significantly reduce [[suffering]] for larger numbers of people.  This approach would mainly consider the numbers of people that can be helped by a research policy.  Research is more likely to be supported when it costs less and has greater benefits.  Utilitarian research often pursues incremental improvements rather than dramatic advancements in knowledge, or break-through solutions, which are more commercially viable/feasible.

In contrast, monumental science is a policy in which science is supported for the sake of a greater understanding of the universe, rather than for specific short-term practical goals.  This designation covers both large projects, often with large facilities, and smaller research that does not have obvious practical applications and are often overlooked.  While these projects may not always have obvious practical outcomes, they provide education of future scientists, and advancement of scientific knowledge of lasting worth about the basic building blocks of science.&lt;ref name=Vuong2018&gt;{{cite journal|title=The (ir)rational consideration of the cost of science in transition economies|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|volume=2|issue=1|pages=5|date=January 1, 2018|doi=10.1038/s41562-017-0281-4|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0281-4|accessdate=January 2, 2018|last1=Vuong|first1=Quan-Hoang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical outcomes do result from many of these "monumental" science programs.  Sometimes these practical outcomes are foreseeable and sometimes they are not.  A classic example of a monumental science program focused towards a practical outcome is the [[Manhattan project]].  An example of a monumental science program that produces unexpected practical outcome is the [[laser]].  Coherent light, the principle behind lasing, was first predicted by Einstein in 1916, but not created until 1954 by Charles H. Townes with the [[maser]].  The breakthrough with the maser led to the creation of the laser in 1960 by Theodore Maiman.  The delay between the theory of coherent light and the production of the laser was partially due to the assumption that it would be of no practical use.&lt;ref&gt;Suplee, Curt (1999) ''Physics In The 20th Century'' Harry N. Abrams Inc, 58-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scholastic conservation===
This policy approach prioritizes efficiently teaching all available science to those who can use it, rather than investing in new science.  In particular, the goal is not to ''lose'' any existing knowledge, and to find new practical ways to apply the available knowledge.  The classic success stories of this method occurred in the 19th century U.S. land-grant universities, which established a strong tradition of research in practical agricultural and engineering methods.  More recently, the [[Green Revolution]] prevented mass famine over the last thirty years.  The focus, unsurprisingly, is usually on developing a robust curriculum and inexpensive practical methods to meet local needs.

== Science policy by country ==

Most developed countries usually have a specific national body overseeing national science (including technology and innovation) policy. In the case developing countries many follow the same fashion.  Many governments of [[developed country|developed countries]] provide considerable funds (primarily to universities) for scientific research (in fields such as [[physics]] and [[geology]]) as well as social science research (in fields such as [[economics]] and [[history]]). Much of this is not intended to provide concrete results that may be commercialisable, although research in scientific fields may lead to results that have such potential. Most university research is aimed at gaining publication in [[peer review]]ed [[academic journal]]s.

A funding body is an organisation that provides [[research funding]] in the form of [[research grant]]s or [[scholarship]]s.  Research councils are the funding bodies that are government-funded agencies engaged in the support of research in different disciplines and postgraduate funding.  Funding from research councils is typically competitive. As a general rule, more funding is available in science and engineering disciplines than in the arts and social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prospects.ac.uk/cms/ShowPage/Home_page/Funding_my_further_study/Public_funding_bodies/p!ejclk | title = Public funding bodies | work = [[Graduate Prospects]] | accessdate = 2007-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the two main research councils are the [[Australian Research Council]] and the [[National Health and Medical Research Council]].

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], the three main research councils ("Tri-Council") are the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council]] (SSHRC) the [[Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council]] (NSERC) and the [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research]] (CIHR). Additional research funding agencies include the [[Canada Foundation for Innovation]], [[Genome Canada]], [[Sustainable Development Technology Canada]] and several Tri-Council supported [[Networks of Centres of Excellence]]. [http://www.nce.gc.ca/]

===Brazil===

In Brazil, two important research agencies are the [[National Council for Scientific and Technological Development]] (CNPq, Portuguese: Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico), an organization of the Brazilian federal government under the Ministry of Science and Technology, and [[São Paulo Research Foundation]] (FAPESP, Portuguese: Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo), a public foundation located in the state of São Paulo, Brazil [http://www.fapesp.br/en/].

===European Union===
The science policy of the [[European Union]] is carried out through the [[European Research Area]], which is a system that integrates the scientific resources of member nations and acts as a "common market" for research and innovation purpose.  The European Union's executive body, the [[European Commission]], has a [[Directorate-General for Research (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Research]]; which is responsible for the Union's science policy.  In addition, the [[Joint Research Centre]] provides independent scientific and technical advice to the European Commission and Member States of the [[European Union]] (EU) in support of EU policies.&lt;ref name="a1370"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/jrc/index.cfm?id=1370 | title=EU Science Hub - European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also the recently established [[European Research Council]], the first European Union [[Funding of science|funding body]] set up to support investigator-driven research.

There are also European science agencies that operate independently of the European Union, such as the [[European Science Foundation]], [[European Space Agency]], and the [[European Higher Education Area]]; which are created by the [[Bologna process]].

On science policy and on the European Research Area is grounded the [[European environmental research and innovation policy]], which addresses global challenges of pivotal importance for the well-being of the European citizens within the context of sustainable development and environmental protection. Research and innovation in Europe is financially supported by the programme [[Horizon 2020]], which is also open to participation worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;See Horizon 2020 – the EU's new research and innovation programme http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-1085_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
German research funding agencies include the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]], which covers both [[science]] and [[humanities]].

=== India ===
Research funding by the Government of India comes from a number of sources.  For basic science and technology research, these include the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Department of Science and Technology (DST), and University Grants Commission (UGC).  For medical research, these include the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), CSIR, DST and Department of Biotechnology (DBT).  For applied research, these include the CSIR, DBT and Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC).

Other funding authorities are the Defence Research Development Organisation (DRDO), the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the Department of Ocean Development (DOD), the Indian Council for Social Science Research (ICSSR), and the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MEF) etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unom.ac.in/gcl-opac/Research%20funding.htm#Indian%20Research%20Funding%20Agencies&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ireland ===
Irish funding councils include the Irish Research Council (IRC) and the [[Science Foundation Ireland]]. The prior [[IRCSET|Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology]] (IRCSET) and the Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences (IRCHSS) were merged to form the IRC in March 2012.&lt;ref name="IRC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.research.ie/aboutus/about-irc | title=About Us | publisher=Irish Research Council | accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Netherlands ===
Dutch research funding agencies include [[Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek]] (NWO) [http://nwo.nl/] and [[Agentschap NL]] [http://www.agentschapnl.nl/].

=== Pakistan ===
The Government of Pakistan has mandated that a certain percentage of gross revenue generated by all telecom service providers be allocated to development and research of information and communication technologies. The [[National ICT R&amp;D Fund (Pakistan)|National ICT R&amp;D Fund]] was established in January 2007.

===Russia===
Under the Soviet Union, much research was routinely [[Suppressed research in the Soviet Union|suppressed]].
Now science in Russia is supported by state and private funds. From the state: the Russian Humanitarian Scientific Foundation (http://www.rfh.ru), the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (www.rfbr.ru), the Russian Science Foundation (http://rscf.ru)

=== Switzerland ===
Swiss research funding agencies include the [[Swiss National Science Foundation]] (SNSF), the innovation promotion agency CTI (CTI/KTI), Ressortforschung des Bundes [http://www.ressortforschung.admin.ch/], and Eidgenössische Stiftungsaufsicht [http://www.edi.admin.ch/esv/].

===United Kingdom===
{{main|Research Councils UK}}

In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Haldane principle]], that decisions about what to spend research funds on should be made by researchers rather than politicians, is still influential in research policy. There are several university departments with a focus on science policy, such as the [[Science Policy Research Unit]]. There are seven grant-awarding [[Research Councils UK|Research Councils]]:
* [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] (AHRC)
* [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council]] (BBSRC)
* [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC)
* [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] (EPSRC)
* [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC)
* [[Natural Environment Research Council]] (NERC)
* [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]] (STFC)

===United States===
{{main|Science policy of the United States}}

The [[United States]] has a long history of government support specially for science and technology.  Science policy in the United States is the responsibility of many organizations throughout the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]].  Much of the large-scale policy is made through the legislative [[United States budget process|budget process]] of enacting the yearly [[United States federal budget|federal budget]].  Further decisions are made by the various federal agencies which spend the funds allocated by Congress, either on in-house research or by granting funds to outside organizations and researchers.

Research funding agencies in the United States are spread among many different departments, which include:
* Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]])
* [[United States Department of Energy]] Office of Science
* [[National Institutes of Health]]: biomedical research
* [[National Science Foundation]]: fundamental research and education in all the non-medical fields of science and engineering.
* [[Office of Naval Research]]

The policies of the United States  The [[Almanac]] of Policy Issues, which provides background information, archived documents, and links to major U.S. public policy issues, organized the public policy of the United States into nine categories. The following lists these categories followed by a few examples of specific, respective policies:

==Agricultural policy==
[[Agricultural policy of the United States]] is the governing [[agricultural policy|policy]] for [[agriculture in the United States]] and is composed primarily of the periodically renewed federal [[U.S. farm bill]]s.

In "A New Agricultural Policy for the United States," authors Dennis Keeney and Long Kemp summarize the agricultural policy of the United States as follows: "Because of its unique geography, weather, history and policies, the United States has an agriculture that has been dominated by production of commodity crops for use in animal, industrial and export enterprises. Over time agricultural policies evolved to support an industrialized, commodity-based agriculture.  This evolution resulted in farmers leaving the land with agriculture moving to an industrial structure."&lt;ref&gt;The Minnesota Project [http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:JjK5X-ACXlMJ:www.mnproject.org/pdf/A%2520New%2520Agriculture%2520Policy%2520for%2520the%2520U.S.%2520by%2520Dennis%2520Keeney%2520%2520Lo..pdf+a+new+agriculture+policy+united+states&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us/''A New Agricultural Policy of the United States.''], July, 2003, accessed February 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel with the industrialization of agriculture in the United States, the Federal Government also developed the [[Dietary Guidelines for Americans]], which emphasize consumption of foods that are produced by large-scale farming.

==Drug policy==

The [[drug policy of the United States]] is established by The [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]], a former cabinet-level&lt;ref name=csm&gt;{{cite web

Its stated goal is to establish policies, priorities, and objectives to eradicate illicit [[Recreational drug use|drug use]], drug manufacturing, and [[drug trafficking|trafficking]], [[drug-related crime]] and violence, and drug-related health consequences in the U.S.

The Office of National Drug Control Policy's two current specific goals are to "curtail illicit drug consumption in America" and to "improve the public health and public safety of the American people by reducing the consequences of drug abuse."&lt;ref name="whitehousedrugpolicy.gov"&gt;President Obama [http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/strategy/2010StrategyExecutiveSummary.pdf "2010 National Drug Control Policy."], ''Office of National Drug Control Policy'', 2010, accessed February 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; They plan to achieve these goals by taking the following actions:

*Strengthen efforts to prevent drug use in communities
*Seek early intervention opportunities in health care
*Integrate treatment for substance use disorders into health care, and expand support for recovery
*Break the cycle of drug use, crime, delinquency, and incarceration
*Disrupt domestic drug trafficking and production
*Strengthen international partnerships
*Improve information systems for analysis, assessment, and local management&lt;ref name="whitehousedrugpolicy.gov"/&gt;

==Energy policy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
The [[energy policy of the United States]] addresses issues of energy production, distribution, and consumption, such as building codes and gas mileage standards. The [[United States Department of Energy]] plays a major role, and its mission is "to ensure America's security and prosperity by addressing its energy, environmental, and nuclear challenges through transformative science and technology solutions."

Moreover, the White House provides a summary of the United States' current condition regarding its energy policy: "For decades it has been clear that the way Americans produce and consume energy is not sustainable. Our addiction to foreign oil and fossil fuels puts our economy, our national security and our environment at risk. To take this country in a new direction, the President is working with Congress to pass comprehensive energy and climate legislation to protect our nation from the serious economic and strategic risks associated with our reliance on foreign oil, to create jobs, and to cut down on the carbon pollution that contributes to the destabilizing effects of climate change."

The following is a snapshot of the United States' current energy policy goals:

*Clean Energy Economy: make the investments in clean energy sources that will put Americans back in control of our energy future, create millions of new jobs and lay the foundation for long-term economic security. This will be accomplished by taking the following actions:
**Initiating recovery act investments in clean energy
**Applying more stringent appliance efficiency standards
**Leading the way in  sustainability
**Creating efficiency standards for cars and trucks
**Making homes more energy efficient

==Environmental policy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
The [[environmental policy of the United States]] addresses and regulates activities that impact the environment. Its general goal is to protect the environment for the welfare of future generations. The environmental policy goals are detailed below:

*The Environment: the United States is committed to protecting our country's air, water, and land, from restoring ecosystems in the Chesapeake Bay and the Everglades, to reducing the impacts of mountaintop mining. Specifically, the environment will be protected by taking the following actions:
**Protecting our oceans
**Land conservation
**Restoring our ecosystems
**Renewing the federal commitment to California's Bay Delta
**Chesapeake Bay protection and restoration
**Great Lakes restoration
**Limiting mercury emissions 
**Reducing the environmental impact of mountaintop coal mining

'''Policy alienation''' refers to a framework which examines the experiences of governmental employees with new policies they have to implement. It has been used to describe the experiences of front-line public professionals with new policies. It is defined "as a general cognitive state of psychological disconnection from the policy programme being implemented."

==Introduction==
A number of examples can clarify the concept of policy alienation. For example, Bottery (1998:40),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bottery|first=M.|title=Professionals and policy: Management strategy in a competitive world|year=1998|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-304-70157-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; examining the pressures on professionals stemming from new policies in education and [[health care]] in Great Britain, cites a teacher arguing that: “The changes have been outrageous, and have produced a culture of meritocracy and high flyers. There’s massive paperwork because the politicians don’t believe teachers are to be trusted.” This indicates that professionals had difficulties identifying with the policies they had to implement. A second example refers to the introduction of a new reimbursement policy in mental healthcare in the Netherlands. In one large-scale survey, as many as nine out of ten professionals wanted to abandon this new policy (Palm et al., 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palm, I., Leffers, F., Emons, T., Van Egmond, V., &amp; Zeegers, S.|title=De GGz ontwricht: Een praktijkonderzoek naar de gevolgen van het nieuwe zorgstelsel in de geestelijke gezondheidszorg|year=2008|publisher=SP|location=The Hague|url=http://www.sp.nl/service/rapport/081025GGZ_ontwricht.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists even went as far as to openly demonstrate on the street against this policy. A major reason for this was that many could not align their professional values with the content of the policy. As one professional noted:

''"Within the new healthcare system economic values are dominant. Too little attention is being paid to the content: professionals helping patients. The result is that professionals become more aware of the costs and revenues of their behavior. This comes at the expense of acting according to professional standards.”''{{Attribution needed|date=June 2012}}

Overall, a number of studies show an increasing discontent among public professionals toward public policies (see also Hebson et al., 2003; White, 1996),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hebson, G., Grimshaw, D., &amp; Marchington, M.|title=PPPs and the changing public sector ethos: Case-study evidence from the health and local authority sectors|journal=Work Employment and Society|year=2003|volume=17|issue=3|pages=481–501|doi=10.1177/09500170030173005|url=http://wes.sagepub.com/content/17/3/481.short|accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White, D.|title=A balancing act: Mental health policy-making in Quebec|journal=International Journal of Law and Psychiatry|year=1996|volume=19|issue=4|pages=289–307|pmid=8968814|doi=10.1016/s0160-2527(96)80005-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; although more positive experiences can also be found (Ruiter, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruiter, A. E. P.|title=Implementatie van het structureel echoscopisch onderzoek: Samenwerking en kwaliteitsdenken|year=2007|publisher=University of Twente|location=Twemte|url=http://essay.utwente.nl/58027/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy alienation framework was developed to better understand the experiences of front-line public professionals with new policies.

==Effects of policy alienation==
Currently, there is an intense debate concerning professionals in the public sector. Many of the pressures that professionals face are related to the difficulties they have with the policies they have to implement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editors=Duyvendak, W. G. J., Knijn, T., &amp; Kremer, M.|title=Policy, people, and the new professional. de-professionalisation and re-professionalisation in care and welfare|year=2006|publisher=[[Amsterdam University Press]]|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-90-5356-885-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When implementers are unable to identify with a policy, this can negatively influence policy effectiveness. Furthermore, a high degree of policy alienation can  affect the quality of interactions between professionals and citizens, which may eventually influence the output legitimacy of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Bekkers, V. J. J. M., Edwards, A., Fenger, M., &amp; Dijkstra, G.|title=Governance and the Democratic Deficit, assessing the legitimacy of governance practices|year=2007|publisher=Aldershot|location=Ashgate|isbn=978-0-7546-4983-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy alienation framework is used to analyze this topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tummers|first=L.G. |author2=Bekkers, V.J.J.M. |author3=Steijn, A.J.|title=Policy alienation of public professionals: Application in a new public management context|journal=Public Management Review|year=2009|volume=11|issue=5|pages=685–706|doi=10.1080/14719030902798230|url=http://repub.eur.nl/pub/16897 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been shown that policy alienation increases resistance to a new policy, lowers behavioral support for the policy and decreases job satisfaction of public professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tummers, L.G.|title=Policy alienation - Analyzing the experiences of public professionals with new policies|year=2012|publisher=Erasmus University Rotterdam|location=Rotterdam}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, it has both influences on the individual professional, as well as on  policy effectiveness.

== Conceptualization ==
Alienation broadly refers to a sense of social estrangement, an absence of social support or meaningful social connection. Sociologists, [[public administration]] scholars, and other social scientists have used the alienation concept in various studies. As a result, a number of meanings have been attributed to the term.&lt;ref name=Kanungo&gt;{{cite book|last=Kanungo|first=R.|title=Work alienation: an integrative approach|year=1982|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-0-03-060241-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to provide clarity, Seeman broke these meanings down into [[Social alienation|five alienation dimensions]]: powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, social isolation, and self-estrangement.

Many scholars have used these dimensions to devise operational measures for alienation so that they can examine the concept in a range of settings. Mau, for example, used four dimensions in examining student alienation. Rayce et al., when investigating adolescent alienation, used three of the five dimensions. Further, many other researchers have used Seeman’s classification in examining the concept of work alienation. [[Bob Blauner|Blauner]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blauner, R.|title=Alienation and freedom|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; devised operational measures for three of the dimensions: powerlessness, meaninglessness, and social isolation.

The policy alienation framework was conceptualized based on the works of sociologists such as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], Seeman, and Blauner.  Furthermore, works of public administration scholars were used, particularly on [[Michael Lipsky|Lipsky]] (street-level bureaucracy). Like work alienation, policy alienation is multidimensional, consisting of policy powerlessness and policy meaninglessness dimensions. In the work alienation literature, the dimensions of powerlessness and meaninglessness are also considered very important.&lt;ref name=Kanungo /&gt;

In essence, powerlessness is a person's lack of control over events in their life. In the realm of policy formulation and implementation, policy powerlessness relates to the degree of influence public professionals have over shaping a policy program. Powerlessness can occur when a new policy is drafted without the help of the professionals, by for example not consulting their professionals associations or labor unions. Furthermore, on an operational level professionals can feel powerless when they have to adhere to tight procedures and rules when implementing a policy (see also [[Michael Lipsky|Lipsky]]). This kind of powerlessness may be particularly pronounced in professionals whose expectations of discretion and autonomy contradict notions of bureaucratic control (see also [[Profession]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freidson, E.|title=Professionalism: The third logic|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-226-26203-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second dimension of policy alienation is meaninglessness. In the realm of policy making and implementation, policy meaninglessness refers to a professional’s perception of the contribution that the policy makes to a greater purpose, most notably to society or to their own clients. For instance, a professional can feel that implementing a policy is meaningless, if it does not deliver any apparent beneficial outcomes for society, such as more safety on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Thiel, S., &amp; Leeuw, F. L.|title=The performance paradox in the public sector|journal=Public Performance and Management Review|year=2002|volume=25|issue=3|pages=267–281|doi=10.2307/3381236|url=http://repub.eur.nl/res/pub/1577/BSK074.pdf|jstor=3381236|hdl=1765/1577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To make the dimensions more specific, five sub-dimensions were identified: strategic, tactical and operational powerlessness, societal and client meaninglessness. This is shown in the table below.

'''Five sub-dimensions of policy alienation'''
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Sub-dimension !! Definition !! Example of high scores
|-
| Strategic powerlessness || The perceived influence of the professionals on decisions concerning the content of the policy, as is captured in rules and regulations || A professional feeling that the policy is drafted without the help of implementing professionals or professional associations.
|-
| Tactical powerlessness || The professionals’ perceived influence on decisions concerning the way policy is implemented within their own organization. || Professionals stating that the managers in the organization did not consult them or their colleagues when designing the implementation process for the policy.
|-
| Operational powerlessness || The perceived degree of freedom in making choices concerning the sort, quantity and quality of sanctions and rewards on offer when implementing the policy. || Answering ‘fully agree’ to a survey question on whether the professional feels that their autonomy during the implementation process was lower than it should be.
|-
| Societal meaninglessness || The perception of professionals concerning the added value of the policy to socially relevant goals. || Stating in an interview that “I agree with the policy goal of enhancing transparency, but I do not see how this policy helps in achieving this goal.”
|-
| Client meaninglessness || The professionals’ perceptions of the added value of their implementing a policy for their own clients. || A professional who argues that a particular policy seriously impinges on their clients’ privacy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3099">'''Nosokinetics''' is the science/subject of measuring and modelling the process of care in [[health care|health]] and [[social care]] systems.&lt;ref name=nosok&gt;[http://info200.infc.ulst.ac.uk/nosokinetics/ Nosokinetics website]&lt;/ref&gt;'' Nosokinetics'' brings together the [[Greek language|Greek]] words for ''noso'': disease and ''kinetics'': movement.

[[Black box]] models are currently used to plan changes in health and social care systems. These input-output models overlook the process of inpatient care, as a result suboptimal decisions are made. Nosokinetics, (analogous to [[Pharmacokinetics]]), seeks to develop dynamic methods which measure and model the process of inpatient care. The aim is to develop a scientific base to underpin the planning of sustainable health and social care systems.
== Establishment ==
Nosokinetics is a new ''science'' that was established in the UK in the early 1990s by Prof [[Peter H Millard]] after publishing his PhD thesis. In 2004 Nosokinetics group newsletter was established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://info200.infc.ulst.ac.uk/events/hscm2008/keynotes.html Peter Millard Resume &amp; Photo] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825172724/http://info200.infc.ulst.ac.uk/events/hscm2008/keynotes.html |date=August 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
Prof [[Peter  H Millard]] writes about Nosokinetics : "If the random forces of wind and tide can make such a beautiful statue (referring to an [[iceberg]]), how much better could [[human|mankind]] do if a new [[science]] was developed which explains the complex processes of health and social care. Until new methods of planning health and social care services to meet the needs of an [[ageing]] population are introduced, service delivery will stumble on from [[crisis]] to crisis. The world population is ageing and sustainable systems of health care need to be developed."&lt;ref name=nosok/&gt;

He has established the nosokinetics group of interested [[researcher]]s. The group collaborates to organize [[Academic conference|conferences]] and disseminates [[news]] of nosokinetics and other researchers' research and practical use of modelling to enhance decision making in health and social care systems.&lt;ref name=nosok/&gt;

== Network ==
The Nosokinetics Group has succeeded in attracting a lot of researchers. Nosokinetics interested people are present in many countries including [[Australia]], [[UK]] &amp; [[Egypt]]. They are from different disciplines ranging from health care providers to management scientists. The news related to nosokinetics is shared to the network through the bimonthly newsletter ''Nosokinetics News''&lt;ref&gt;[http://info200.infc.ulst.ac.uk/nosokinetics/newsletter.htm Nosokinetics newsletter archive]&lt;/ref&gt; which helps to communicate papers, conferences and events of interest to the Nosokinetics network.

Policy Studies also examines the conflicts and conflict resolution that arise from the making of policies in civil society, the private sector, or more commonly, in the public sector (e.g. government).

It frequently focuses on the [[public sector]] but is equally applicable to other kinds of organizations (e.g., the not-for-profit sector).  Some policy study experts graduate from [[public policy school]]s with [[public policy degrees]]. Alternatively, experts may have backgrounds in [[policy analysis]], [[program evaluation]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], [[economics]], [[anthropology]], [[geography]], [[law]], [[political science]], [[social work]], [[environmental planning]] and [[public administration]].

Traditionally, the field of policy studies focused on [[domestic policy]], with the notable exceptions of [[foreign policy|foreign]] and [[defense policy|defense policies]]. However, the wave of [[economic globalization]], which ensued in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, created a need for a subset of policy studies that focuses on [[global governance]], especially as it relates to issues that transcend [[national borders]] such as [[climate change]], [[terrorism]], [[nuclear proliferation]], and [[economic development]]. This subset of policy studies, which is often referred to as international policy studies, typically requires mastery of a [[second language]] and attention to [[cross-cultural]] issues in order to address [[nation]]al and [[cultural bias]]es. For example, the [[Monterey Institute of International Studies]] at [[Middlebury College]] offers Master of Arts programs that focus exclusively on international policy through a mix of [[interdisciplinary]] and [[cross-cultural]] analysis called the "Monterey Way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miis.edu/academics/courses|title=Courses - Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of academic programs in policy studies include the [[Harvard Kennedy School]] and the [[LBJ School of Public Affairs]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="460">'''Blanket policy''' is a [[policy]] which behaves similarly to a variety of things. Based on [[Webster's Dictionary]] it "covers a group or class of things or properties instead of one or more things mentioned individually, as where a [[Mortgage law|mortgage]] secures various [[debt]]s as a group, or subjects a group or class of different pieces of property to one general lien."

'''Open educational resource policies (OER policies)''' are principles or tenets adopted by governing bodies in support of the use of [[open content]]—specifically [[open educational resources]] (OER) -- and [[Open Educational Practices|practices]] in educational institutions. Such policies are emerging increasingly at the national, state/province, and local levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Giving Knowledge  for Free: The Emergence of Open Educational Resources|year=2007|publisher=Centre for Educational Research and Innovation (CERI), OECD|url=http://www.oecd.org/edu/ceri/38654317.pdf|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Creative Commons]] defines (OER) policies as "legislation, institutional policies, and/or funder mandates that lead to the creation, increased use, and/or support for improving OER."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OER Policy Registry|url=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/OER_Policy_Registry|publisher=Creative Commons|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; OER are learning materials that reside in the public domain or have been released under an [[free license|intellectual property license]] that permits their free use and re-purposing by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Educational Resources|url=http://www.hewlett.org/programs/education-program/open-educational-resources|publisher=William and Flora Hewlett Foundation|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== OER Policy Clearinghouses ==
[[Creative Commons]] hosts an open educational resources policy registry which lists 112 current and proposed open education policies from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OER Policy Registry|url=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/OER_Policy_Registry|publisher=Creative Commons|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another resource for finding OER policies is the Open Educational Quality Initiative [http://www.oer-quality.org/clearinghouse/browse/ OPAL Best Practice Clearing House]. The OPAL Initiative is a partnership between seven organizations including the [http://www.icde.org International Council for Open and Distance Education] (ICDE), UNESCO, European Foundation for Quality, the Open University UK, Aalto University and the Catholic University Portugal. Led by the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany, it is partly funded by the European Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The OPAL Initiative | url = http://www.oer-quality.org/the-opal-initiative/ | website = OPAL Open Educational Quality Initiative | publisher = University Duisburg Essen | accessdate = 23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== UNESCO OER Congress ==
On Friday 22 June 2012, the [[UNESCO]] World Open Educational Resources (OER) Congress released the [[UNESCO 2012 Paris OER Declaration|2012 Paris OER Declaration]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2012 Paris OER Declaration|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/Events/Paris%20OER%20Declaration_01.pdf|newspaper=2012 World Open Educational Resources (OER) Congress  UNESCO, Paris, June 20–22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which called on governments to openly license publicly funded educational materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO World OER Congress releases 2012 Paris OER Declaration|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/news-and-in-focus-articles/all-news/news/unesco_world_oer_congress_releases_2012_paris_oer_declaration/|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Educational Resources Congress passes historic declaration|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/news-and-in-focus-articles/in-focus-articles/2012/open-educational-resources-congress-passes-historic-declaration/|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UNESCO member states unanimously approved the declaration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Green|first=Cable|title=2012 Paris OER Declaration|url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/33089|newspaper=Creative Commons blog|date=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which highlights the importance of [[open educational resources]] and gives recommendations to governments and institutions around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pawlowski|first=J.M.|author2=Hoel, T.|title=Towards a Global Policy for Open  Educational Resources: The Paris OER Declaration and its  Implications|journal=White Paper 0.2|year=2012|url=http://monet.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/giotto/OpenScout_df6f1252-bfa6-11e1-a668-e13baff9bd23.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policies adopted by national councils of education ==
On January 17, 2014, the Council on Higher Education in South Africa published a ''[http://www.che.ac.za/announcements/white-paper-post-school-education-and-training White Paper for Post-School Education and Training]''. This paper emphasized open learning principles and set the stage for supporting national efforts to design and develop high-quality open educational resources. In response the [http://oeru.org/oeru-partners/university-of-south-africa/ University of South Africa (UNISA)]—one of the founding partners of the [http://wikieducator.org/OERu/Home OERu network] and a member of the 2012 Unesco OER conference in Paris—approved an Open Educational Resource (OER) Strategy in March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Open Education Resources (OER) Strategy, 2014-2016 | publisher = University of South Africa (UNISA) | url = http://www.unisa.ac.za/contents/unisaopen/docs/OER%20Strategy%20%28final%29%20March%202014.pdf | date = 26 March 2014 | accessdate = 20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policies adopted by research universities ==
An open-access policy enacted by the Faculty of a research university can empower them in choosing how to distribute their own scholarly work. If a faculty member wishes to grant exclusive rights to a publisher, they would first need to request a waiver from their faculty governance body. Some reasons to implement this kind of policy institution-wide are to:
# increase the overall impact of an institution's research contributions to the global knowledge economy, 
# individual faculty receive their institution's full support in a unified action to work with publishers to simplify procedures and broaden access to their scholarly work (allowing for greater possibilities for citations of their work - important for hiring, tenure and promotion decisions),
# take advantage of scholarly interactions with a greater diversity of readers, not just those who can afford to purchase the information from a vendor or attend an academic conference.

This kind of blanket policy provides support to those whose research is not part of a project that requires open access to the research done. For example, since the [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310081557/https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/ostp_public_access_memo_2013.pdf February 2013 directive] from the [http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp United States Office of Science and Technology Policy], U.S. federal agencies have been developing their own policies on making research freely available within a year of publication.

SPARC, the [http://sparc.arl.org/about Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition], led the collaborative and open effort to create an "Open Access Spectrum" that demonstrates a more sophisticated approach is needed in discussions about the concept of openness in research communications. The [http://sparc.arl.org/resource/howopenisit "HowOpenIsIt? Guide] (as well as an FAQ document and slide deck) is available for download on the SPARC website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Yaplee | first = Darlene | title = HowOpenIsIt? New Guide Released | website = Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) | publisher = Association of Research Libraries | url = http://sparc.arl.org/resource/howopenisit | place = Washington D.C. | accessdate = April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another useful guide has been developed by members of the Harvard Office for Scholarly Communication, the Harvard Open Access Project, and the Berkman Center for Internet and Society. This online guide, "[https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/hoap/Good_practices_for_university_open-access_policies Good practices for university open-access policies]" is built on a wiki and is designed to evolve over time, according to the co-authors: Emily Kilcer, Stuart Shieber and Peter Suber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Good practices for university open-access policies | website = Harvard Open Access Project | publisher = Berkman Center for Internet and Society, Harvard University | place = Cambridge, MA | url = https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/hoap/Good_practices_for_university_open-access_policies | accessdate = April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
==== California Institute of Technology ====
On June 10, 2013, the Faculty Board of the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) created an institution-wide Open Access Policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Schaffhauser | first = Dian | title = Caltech Adopts Open Access Policy for Scholarly Writing | date = 6 January 2014 | url = http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/01/06/caltech-adopts-open-access-policy-for-scholarly-writing.aspx | newspaper= Campus Technology |location= Chatsworth, CA |publisher= 1105 Media Inc, Ed-Tech Group | accessdate = 2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = California Institute of Technology Open Access Policy, Approved by the Caltech Faculty Board on June 10, 2013 | url = http://library.caltech.edu/coda/OA_Policy_6.10.2013.pdf | last = Faculty Board | first = California Institute of Technology | accessdate = 2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that as of January 1, 2014, all Caltech faculty must agree to grant nonexclusive rights to Caltech to disseminate their scholarly papers either via the authors' own sites or to Caltech AUTHORS, the online repository. The goal is to encourage wider distribution of their work and to simplify the copyright process when posting research on faculty or institutional Web sites. The initiative was put in place to prevent publishers of those journals from threatening legal action or issuing takedown notices to authors who have posted their content on their own sites or to [http://authors.library.caltech.edu/ CaltechAUTHORS], an online repository for research papers authored by Caltech faculty and other researchers at Caltech.

==== Duke University ====
On March 21, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Geoffrey | last = Mock | title = Faculty Move Forward on Open Access Policy | website = DukeToday | publisher = Office of News and Communications, Duke University | date = 21 March 2010 | url = http://today.duke.edu/2010/03/accessvote.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Duke University]] Academic Council voted to support the University Library's new data repository, [http://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/ DukeSpace], with a blanket policy to provide open access to their scholarly writings. The policy allows for faculty members to opt out at any time, and it is regularly reviewed to determine its effectiveness.

Duke also in 2010 joined the [http://www.oacompact.org/ Compact for Open-Access Publishing Equity] (COPE) and established a fund to help Duke faculty members to cover any [[author fees]] required to publish in open access journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Open Access at Duke University | website = Duke University Libraries | url = http://library.duke.edu/research/openaccess | publisher = Duke University | accessdate = 3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Harvard University ====
On February 12, 2008, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences of [[Harvard University]] approved their [https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/hfaspolicy Open Access Policy], granting to the President and Fellows of Harvard to "make available his or her scholarly articles and to exercise the copyright in those articles ... in a nonexclusive, irrevocable, paid-up, worldwide license..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences Open Access Policy, Voted February 12, 2008 | website = Office for Scholarly Communication | publisher = Harvard University Library | location = Cambridge, MA | url = https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/hfaspolicy | accessdate = 3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, several other schools within the University now participate in the Open Access Policies supported by the Office for Scholarly Communication: the Graduate School of Design, the School of Education, the Business School, the Law School, the Kennedy School of Government, the Divinity School, and the School of Public Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Open Access Policies | website = Office for Scholarly Communication | publisher = Harvard University Library | location = Cambridge, MA  | url = https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/policies}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University's open-access repository is called [https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/dash/ DASH] (Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard) which is where the faculty upload their scholarly articles for access by all.

==== Massachusetts Institute of Technology ====
Adopted by a unanimous vote on March 18, 2009, the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) Faculty adopted an open access policy. The policy applies to "all scholarly articles written while the person is a member of the Faculty except for any articles completed before the adoption of this policy and any articles for which the Faculty member entered into an incompatible licensing or assignment agreement before the adoption of this policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = MIT Faculty Open Access Policy | website = Scholarly Publishing @ MIT | publisher = Massachusetts Institute of Technology | url = http://libraries.mit.edu/scholarly/mit-open-access/open-access-at-mit/mit-open-access-policy/ | accessdate = April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MIT online repository is called [http://dspace.mit.edu/login DSpace@MIT] and it was designed to work seamlessly with Google Scholar. The Faculty revised and updated the policy in 2010 to take into consideration the various issues associated with the MIT librarians' discussions with publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holton|first=Richard|title=Maintaining Our Resolutions: Implementing the MIT Faculty Open Access Policy|journal=MIT Faculty Newsletter|date=November–December 2010|volume=XXIII|issue=2|url=http://web.mit.edu/fnl/volume/232/holton.html|accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Princeton University ====
In 2010 the Dean of the Faculty of [[Princeton University]] appointed an ad-hoc committee of faculty and the University Librarian to study the question of open access to faculty publications - and in March 2011, the committee recommended several changes to the Faculty rules to allow for a blanket policy for open access to Princeton faculty scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Memo to the Faculty Advisory Committee on Policy from the Ad-hoc Faculty Committee to study Open Access | url = http://www.princeton.edu/dof/policies/publ/fac/open-access-policy/open-access-report.pdf |  website = Office of the Dean of the Faculty | publisher = Princeton University | accessdate = 3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The faculty approved an open access policy on September 19, 2011, which was last revised in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Open Access Policy | website = Office of the Dean of the Faculty | publisher = Princeton University | url = http://www.princeton.edu/dof/policies/publ/fac/open-access-policy/ | accessdate = 3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Stanford University ====
On June 26, 2008, the [[Stanford University]] Graduate School of Education (GSE) were the first in that school to grant permission to the University to make their scholarly articles publicly accessible and to exercise the copyright in a "nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license ... provided that the articles are properly attributed to the authors not sold for a profit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = GSE Open Access Motion | website = Stanford Graduate School of Education | publisher = Stanford University | url = https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty-research/open-archive/open-access-motion | accessdate = 3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [https://openarchive.stanford.edu/ GSE Open Archive] houses and makes publicly available the GSE authors' working papers as well as published articles. Between May 21-24th, 2013, the Stanford GSE doctoral students voted in favor of a motion to enact an Open Access policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = GSE Student Open Archive Motion | website = Stanford Graduate School of Education | publisher = Stanford University | url = https://openarchive.stanford.edu/content/gse-student-open-archive-motion | accessdate = 3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, however, despite the strong case made by Professors John Willinsky and Juan Pablo Alperin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = John | last = Willinsky | first2 = Juan Pablo | last2 = Alperin | title = The academic ethics of open access to research and scholarship | website = Open Archive | publisher = Stanford University | url = https://openarchive.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/Wilinsky_Alperin_0.pdf | year = 2011 | accessdate = 3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; no other Stanford academic units have stepped forward.

==== University of California ====
On July 24, 2013, the Academic Senate of the [[University of California]] (UC) approved the UC Open Access Policy for all 8,000 plus faculty at their ten campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = UC Open Access Policy | website = Office of Scholarly Communication | publisher = University of California | url = http://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/open-access-policy/ | accessdate = 3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some confusion at the local campuses led to online postings of journal articles whose copyright was already owned by publishers. For example, in December 2013, the academic publishing company [http://www.elsevier.com Elsevier] sent several UC faculty notices to take down certain journal articles posted openly on their campus webpages, e.g., on the department websites or faculty profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Elsevier Takedown Notices for Faculty Articles on UC Sites | website = Office of Scholarly Communication | publisher = University of California | url = http://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/2013/12/elsevier-takedown-notices/ | accessdate = 3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UC Open Access Policy protected those faculty who had correctly uploaded their articles to the UC [http://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/publishing-tools/ eScholarship] repository. In another case of misunderstanding by the faculty about open access, in March 2014 the University received a [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA) takedown notice for nine articles owned by the American Society for Civil Engineers (ASCE). The UC faculty authors had uploaded to eScholarship the publisher-formatted articles between 2004 and 2008, before the UC Open Access Policy had been enacted and in violation of the publisher's agreement with the authors when they gave their copyrights to the ASCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ASCE Takedown Notices | website = Office of Scholarly Communication | publisher = University of California | url = http://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/2014/03/asce-takedown-notices/ | accessdate = 3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== University of Colorado Boulder ====
In 2014 the Faculty Assembly of the University of Colorado Boulder approved the CU Boulder [http://scholar.colorado.edu/openaccess.html Open Access Policy] "in order to allow for broad dissemination of their research." They granted to The Regents of the University of Colorado "a nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license to exercise any and all rights under copyright relating to their scholarly work, as long as the works are properly attributed to the authors and not used for commercial purposes"—and that the individual faculty would retain full ownership of the material. Authors at UC Boulder are expected to inform publishers about the University's policy and that they "have granted a pre-existing License."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CU Boulder Open Access Policy|url=http://scholar.colorado.edu/openaccess.html|website=CU Scholar Institutional Repository|publisher=University of Colorado Boulder|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The digital repository, [http://scholar.colorado.edu/ CU Scholar], is maintained by the University Libraries and functions under a [http://scholar.colorado.edu/policies.html set of policies] derived from the Open Access Policy. Contributions from the CU Boulder community can include working papers and technical reports, published scholarly research articles, completed manuscripts, digital art or multimedia, conference papers and proceedings, theses and dissertations, Undergraduate Honors theses, journals published on campus, faculty course-related output primarily of scholarly interest, and data sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Policies|url=http://scholar.colorado.edu/policies.html|website=CU Scholar Institutional Repository|publisher=University of Colorado Boulder}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Chancellor's Executive Committee recently approved the new policy, following the lead of the Council of Deans and the Office of the Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bolkan|first1=Joshua|title=CU Boulder Adopts Open Access|url=http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/05/18/cu-boulder-adopts-open-access.aspx|website=Campus Technology|publisher=1105 Media Inc. Ed-Tech Group|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== University of Kansas ====
In 2005 the University of Kansas (KU) created [https://web.archive.org/web/20051101213846/https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/dspace/ KU ScholarWorks], a digital repository for scholarly work created by KU faculty and staff. Faculty Senate President Lisa Wolf-Wendel, professor of education leadership and policy studies, approved a new policy, "[http://policy.ku.edu/governance/open-access-policy Open Access Policy for University of Kansas Scholarship]" on April 30, 2009, in order to provide the broadest possible access to the journal literature authored by KU faculty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Governance Policy: Open Access Policy for University of Kansas Scholarship | website = KU Policy Library | publisher = The University of Kansas |  accessdate = 19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, under a faculty-initiated policy approved by Chancellor Robert Hemenway, KU became the first U.S. public university to implement an open access policy.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;{{cite web | first = Rebecca | last = Smith | title = KU becomes first U.S. public university to pass an open access policy | website = KU News | publisher = The University of Kansas | url=http://archive.news.ku.edu/2009/june/26/openaccess.shtml | accessdate= 19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unless a KU author sought a waiver, all articles must be submitted to [https://web.archive.org/web/20051101213846/https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/dspace/ KU ScholarWorks]. "[http://openaccess.ku.edu/sites/openaccess.drupal.ku.edu/files/docs/OA_implement_process_Fac_Senate_endorsed2-11-2010.pdf Processes to Implement the KU Open Access Policy]" were endorsed by the Faculty Senate in February 2010. Theses and dissertations at the University of Kansas are also openly available, however in 2010 KU Graduate Studies established a policy that a student may request permission to embargo its publication for six months, one year or two years. Graduates earning the KU Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing or PhD in English (Literature and Creative Writing track) may request a permanent embargo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Graduate Studies Policy: Embargo Policy for Theses and Dissertations | website = KU Policy Library | publisher = The University of Kansas | url = http://policy.ku.edu/graduate-studies/embargo-policy | accessdate = 19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The JISC/HE OER Programme (Phase 3 from October 2011 – October 2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oro.open.ac.uk/52748/|title=JISC/HE Academy OER Programme: Phase 3 Synthesis and Evaluation Report|last=L.|first=McGill,|last2=I.|first2=Falconer,|date=2013-02-01|website=oro.open.ac.uk|access-date=2018-06-27|last3=A.|first3=Littlejohn,|last4=H.|first4=Beetham,}}&lt;/ref&gt; was meant to build on sustainable procedure indicated in the first two phases eventually expanding in new directions that connect Open Educational Resources to other fields of work&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cronin|first=Catherine|date=2017-08-15|title=Openness and Praxis: Exploring the Use of Open Educational Practices in Higher Education|url=http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/3096|journal=The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning|language=en|volume=18|issue=5|issn=1492-3831}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This third phase involved important stakeholders emphasizing fresh challenges and insights about the effect of OER and Open Educational Practice.

During this stage, the concept of electronic books and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) also emerged. MOOCs &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/distance-learning/moocs-(massive-open-online-courses)/|title=MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses)|access-date=2018-06-27|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;offer courses at the University level without having to finish the whole programme. Many students get the chance to study premium courses online frequently at no cost. HEFCE made significant investments through the JISC and Academy from 2009 until 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://openeducationalresources.pbworks.com/w/page/24838291/Open%20Educational%20Resources%20Programme|title=Open Educational Resources infoKit / Open Educational Resources Programme|website=openeducationalresources.pbworks.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The objective was to encourage sharing and reusing of resources which provide benefits to higher education in the United Kingdom. More than 80 projects obtained funding during the UK OER Programme. Substantial investments were channelled towards the development of Open Educational Resources even as the benefits for stakeholders have not been explained properly. Sufficient evidence is needed to prove this point. One criticism is that many such programmes are not technically and educationally accessible to a worldwide audience&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jisc.ac.uk/full-guide/open-educational-resources|title=Open educational resources (OERs) {{!}} Jisc|website=Jisc|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4260">Policy transfer

==Summary==
Policy transfer is a process in which knowledge about policies, administrative arrangements, institutions and ideas in one political setting (past or present) is used in the development of policies, administrative arrangements, institutions and ideas in another political setting.&lt;ref name="ejournal.narotama"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dolowitz | first1 = D. | last2 = Marsh | first2 = D. | year = 2000 | title = Learning from abroad: The role of policy transfer in contemporary policy-making | url = http://ejournal.narotama.ac.id/files/0952-1895%252E00121.pdf | journal = Governance | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 5–24 | doi=10.1111/0952-1895.00121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policy transfer has a long history with a variety of policies such as [[zero tolerance]] policing, [[welfare-to-work]] and [[Business Improvement District]]s moving between different [[nation states]].

==Academic research on policy transfer==
Policy transfer has been the subject of considerable academic research, led primarily by [[political scientists]] since the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="ueaeprints"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benson | first1 = D. | last2 = Jordan | first2 = A. | year = 2011 | title = What have we learned from policy transfer research? Dolowitz and Marsh revisited | url = http://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/35123/1/PSR_Benson_and_Jordan_Policy_transfer_research_2011.pdf | journal = Political Studies Review | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 366–378 | doi=10.1111/j.1478-9302.2011.00240.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the mid-2000s [[geographers]] have also played an important role in these debates (often use the term ''policy mobilities'' instead of policy transfer).&lt;ref name="McCann"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCann | first1 = E. | last2 = Ward | first2 = K. | year = 2012 | title = Policy assemblages, mobilities and mutations: Toward a multidisciplinary conversation | url = | journal = Political Studies Review | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 325–332 | doi=10.1111/j.1478-9302.2012.00276.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since David Dolowitz and David Marsh's (2000) paper 'Learning from abroad: the role of policy transfer in contemporary policy-making', academic research has focused on the issues of who is involved in policy transfer, what is transferred, from and to where policy is transferred, the degrees of and constraints on transfer, and its success once transferred.&lt;ref name="ejournal.narotama" /&gt; More recently there have been attempts to explicate the role of two way communication, and particularly feedback from policy stakeholders for successful policy transfer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Park|first=C. |author2=Wilding, M. |author3=Chung, C.|title=The importance of feedback: Policy transfer, translation and the role of communication|journal=Policy Studies|date=2014|volume=35|issue=4|pages=397–412 |doi=10.1080/01442872.2013.875155|url=http://usir.salford.ac.uk/31743/1/The_importance_of_feedback_Accepted.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  along with efforts to acknowledge the "indigenization" of policies as they are modified and adapted to context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stone|first=D.|title=Transfer and Translation of Policy|journal=Policy Studies|date=2012|volume=33|issue=6|pages=483–499|doi=10.1080/01442872.2012.695933}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The debates in geography have focused on the technologies and methods through which policies and ideas circulate – such as study tours, [[Business conference|conference]]s and best practice guides – as well as looking at how and why the policies change form as they circulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cook | first1 = I. R. | last2 = Ward | first2 = K. | year = 2012 | title = Conferences, informational infrastructures and mobile policies: the process of getting Sweden 'BID ready | url = http://research.northumbria.ac.uk/urbanfutures/conferences | journal = European Urban and Regional Studies | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 137–152 | doi=10.1177/0969776411420029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research ''' (APN) is an intergovernmental network that promotes policy-oriented research and capacity-building activities related to [[global change]] in the region.&lt;ref&gt;APN. “APN E-Lib | Proceedings of the 5th SPG Meeting (2000 Islamabad Pakistan).” Accessed August 12, 2013. http://www.apn-gcr.org/resources/items/show/1825#.UgiTRqwlGVg.&lt;/ref&gt; APN receives financial contribution from the governments of the United States, Japan, Republic of Korea and New Zealand, with in-kind contribution from all it 22 member countries. The APN Secretariat is based in [[Kobe]], Japan, hosted by the [[Hyōgo Prefecture|Hyogo Prefectural Government]].&lt;ref&gt;APN. “APN Overview.” Accessed August 12, 2013. http://www.apn-gcr.org/apn-overview/.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The history of APN dates back to the 1990 White House Conference on Science and Economics Research Related to Global Change, 17–18 April 1990, at which then US President [[George Bush Sr.|George Bush]] invited countries of the world to join the United States in creating regional networks for North-South scientific cooperation at the intergovernmental level to deal with global environmental change research.&lt;ref&gt;Bush, George. “George Bush: Remarks at the Opening Session of the White House Conference on Science and Economics Research Related to Global Change,” April 17, 1990. http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=18366.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1992, President Bush and then Prime Minister of Japan [[Kiichi Miyazawa]] signed the 1992 US-Japan Global Partnership Agreement, which, among other things, reaffirmed and strengthened Japan-US commitment to global change research.&lt;ref&gt;USDS and MFA. “1992 Tokyo Declaration on the Japan-U.S. Global Partnership and Its Action Plan,” January 9, 1992. http://www.mac.doc.gov/japan-korea/market-opening/ta920109.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussions along these lines ultimately resulted in the establishment of three global change research networks: ENRICH for Europe and Africa, APN for Asia and the Pacific, and [[Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research|IAI]] for the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Fellous, J.-L. and M. Hœpffner. “Global Change Research Networks: The Example of MEDIAS.” Advances in Space Research 17 no. 8 (January 1996): 11–16. doi:10.1016/0273-1177(95)00654-W.&lt;/ref&gt;

APN was formally launched in 1996 at its first intergovernmental meeting held at [[Chiang Mai]], Thailand. In 1997, a competitive process was in place, open to funding applications for scientific research projects relating to global environmental change.

== Membership ==
Starting from 12 countries in 1996, APN membership has grown to 22 as of April 2013. In addition to the 22 full members, institutions and individuals from a number of “approved countries” are eligible for APN funding.

'''Policy monitoring''' comes a range of activities describing and analyzing the development and implementation of policies, identifying potential gaps in the process, outlining areas for improvement, and holding policy implementers accountable for their activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hardee|first=Karen|author2=Laili Irani |author3=Ron MacInnis |author4=Matthew Hamilton |title=Linking Health Policy With Health Systems And Health Outcomes|journal=Washington DC: Futures Group, Health Policy Project|year=2012|url=http://www.healthpolicyproject.com/pubs/186_HealthPolicySystemOutcomesConceptualALDec.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Monitoring policy development and implementation is an integral component of the [[policy cycle]] and can be applied in sectors including agriculture, health, education, and finance. Policy monitoring can improve policy informatioation among stakeholders, and the use of evaluation techniques to provide feedback to reframe and revise policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=Cecilia|author2=Craig Watkins|title=Conceptualizing Spatial Planning Outcomes: Towards an Integrative Measurement Framework|journal=The Town Planning Review|year=2009|volume=80|issue=4/5|url=https://www.questia.com/library/1P3-1899476771/conceptualising-spatial-planning-outcomes-towards}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Waterman and Wood derived policy monitoring from [[agency theory]], describing a process where policymakers monitor the actions of their bureaucratic agents who implement and enforce policies. This monitoring allows policymakers to compensate for their agents’ greater knowledge of the policy process, and enables them to be well-informed decision makers. Thus policy monitoring allows policymakers and interested actors to systematically examine the process of creating a policy, implementing it, and evaluating its effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Waterman|first=Richard|author2=Dan Wood|title=Policy Monitoring and Policy Analysis|journal=Journal of Policy Analysis and Management|year=1993|doi=10.2307/3325346|volume=12|issue=4|pages=685–699|jstor=3325346}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Policy monitoring activities can be used to collect and analyze data related to the development and implementation of specific policies. It can also help link policies to specific outcomes and  help identify and evaluate policy impacts. Policy impacts can include specific changes in behavior (e.g., increased number of people wearing seatbelts), finances (e.g., increased tax revenue), health status or epidemiology (e.g., reduced number of new HIV infections) or other social indicators (e.g., reduced crime rates, reduced levels of pollution). Data from policy monitoring can be used to support advocacy efforts and guide the development of new, timely, and relevant policies. Policy monitoring should also include the identification of operational policy barriers that can be addressed through policy and program reform, and findings can support improved implementation of existing policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hardee|first=Karen|author2=Laili Irani |author3=Ron MacInnis |author4=Matthew Hamilton |title=Linking Health Policy With Health Systems And Health Outcomes|journal=Washington DC: Futures Group, Health Policy Project|year=2012|url=http://www.healthpolicyproject.com/pubs/186_HealthPolicySystemOutcomesConceptualALDec.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges ==
Numerous actors and stakeholders can influence the movement of policy from inception to implementation. Well-maintained documentation and review of all key stakeholders involved in a policy can help advocates for a given policy—such as military reform, water rights, or disability legislation—prepare to address different ideologies, capacities, or interests of key actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Harry|title=A Guide to Monitoring and Evaluating Policy Influence|journal=Overseas Development Institute|date=February 2011|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/6453.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Limiting stakeholder analysis only to government and official policymakers may ignore major groups that can support policy development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hardee|first=Karen|author2=Imelda Feranil |author3=Jill Boezwinkle |author4=Benjamin Clark Benjamin |title=The Policy Circle: A Framework For Analyzing the Components of Family Planning, Reproductive Health, Maternal Health, and HIV/AIDS Policies|journal=Washington DC: Futures Group, Policy Project|year=2004|url=http://www.policyproject.com/pubs/workingpapers/wps-11.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policy monitoring coalitions should agree on what they are monitoring and be succinct in their recommendations to policymakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=Cecilia|author2=Craig Watkins|title=Conceptualizing Spatial Planning Outcomes: Towards an Integrative Measurement Framework|journal=The Town Planning Review|year=2009|volume=80|issue=4/5|url=https://www.questia.com/library/1P3-1899476771/conceptualising-spatial-planning-outcomes-towards}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Policy initiatives themselves are often controversial, and policy monitoring can be contentious because it shows how well policy implementers and enforcers are doing their jobs. Those conducting policy monitoring should be thorough in their data collection and unbiased in their presentation of facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=Dan|title=The Dynamics of Political Control of the Bureaucracy|journal=The American Political Science Review|year=1991|volume=85|issue=3|pages=801–828|jstor=1963851}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Robust trainings on policy monitoring work can help organizations be systematic and effective in their policy monitoring efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Harry|title=A Guide to Monitoring and Evaluating Policy Influence|journal=Overseas Development Institute|date=February 2011|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/6453.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Existing Models and Frameworks for Policy and Advocacy Monitoring ==
=== PEPFAR ===
The [[PEPFAR|United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR)’s Monitoring Policy Reform tool outlines the progression of policy development related to HIV from problem identification to [[Monitoring and Evaluation|monitoring and evaluation]]. The tool supports a relatively simple and uniform monitoring process which can be applied to any policy area. This tool can guide policy monitoring efforts throughout the policy reform process.

 PEPFAR’s six stages of the policy reform process:

:'''Stage 1''': Identify baseline policy issues by conducting situation assessment

:  '''Stage 2''': Engagement of stakeholders in developing common policy agenda

:  '''Stage 3''': Develop policy

:  '''Stage 4''': Official government endorsement of policy

:  '''Stage 5''': Implementation of policy

:  '''Stage 6''': Evaluation of policy implementation (PEPFAR)

=== [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=FAPDA|journal=Food and Agriculture Organization|year=2013|url=http://www.fao.org/economic/fapda/en/|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Working Cycle for Country Approach ===
The FAO’s Food and Agriculture Policy Decision Analysis (FAPDA) is a policy monitoring tool that provides a working cycle technique to identify policy problems and improve analysis of policy issues. By incorporating FAPDA outputs, such as a web-based tool, country policy review, and policy analysis report, policy dialogue can be more systematic and encompass different actors interested in FAPDA data.

 The cycle includes:
  Phase 1: Preparatory Phase
  Phase 2: Focal Point Training
  Phase 3: Policy Identification
  Phase 4: Quality Control and Validation
  Phase 5: 1st Discussion Focus of Analysis
  Phase 6: Analysis
  Phase 7: 2nd Discussion on Findings (FAO)

=== World Health Organization ===
The World Health Organization has started to develop dedicated monitoring systems for policy interventions on the social determinants of health that improve health equity, such as social protection and gender equity policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2471/BLT.16.184622 |pmid=29147060 |pmc=5677605 |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/95/11/16-184622/en/ |title=The need to monitor actions on the social determinants of health |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=95 |issue=11 |pages=784–787 |year=2017 |last1=Pega |first1=Frank |last2=Valentine |first2=Nicole |last3=Rasanathan |first3=Kumanan |last4=Hosseinpoor |first4=Ahmad Reza |last5=Neira |first5=Maria }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
=== Gender ===
Policy monitoring can be performed through different issue-driven lenses, such as gender sensitivity or gender equality. Gender-sensitive policy monitoring analyzes any gender aspects of a policy or policy issue, and considers the impact of the policy on both men and women, as well as its impact on gender relations. For example, a policy that is shown to have improved the welfare of a household may not necessarily affect all household members positively or equally, and may have even exacerbated gender inequity. Gender-sensitive policy monitoring can help advance gender equity and improve policy implementation. Civil society and other stakeholders can use policy monitoring techniques to systematically gather data on the gender aspects of policies and use these data to influence policymakers to favor  gender-equitable health policies¬¬¬—these processes are essential to facilitating [[gender mainstreaming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Mohga Kamal|title=Enhancing Gender Equity in Health Programmes: Monitoring and Evaluation|journal=Gender and Development|year=2001|volume=9|issue=2|pages=95–105|jstor=4030592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==
A 2012 study analyzed planned policy interventions across the 22 publicly accessible PEPFAR Partnership Frameworks to understand how the interventions are related to PEPFAR and country or regional priorities. The study found that “policy monitoring by donors, partner country governments, and civil society stakeholders can help measure whether policy interventions are occurring as planned in order to further HIV prevention, care, and treatment and health system goals and, if not, can point to needed changes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Judice|first=Nicole|title=Monitoring HIV Policy Interventions in PEPFAR Partnership Frameworks|year=2012|volume=presented at Second Global Symposium on Health Systems Research in Beijing, China|url=http://www.healthpolicyproject.com/pubs/152_HSRPoster.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[politics]], a '''mandate''' is the [[authority]] granted by a [[constituency]] to act as its [[Representative democracy|representative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mandate |work=Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |title=Mandate |publisher=Merriam-webster.com|accessdate=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a government having a [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] mandate to govern via the fair winning of a [[democracy|democratic]] [[election]] is a central idea of [[representative democracy]]. New governments who attempt to introduce policies that they did not make public during an election campaign are said not to have a legitimate ''mandate'' to implement such policies.

Elections, especially ones with a large margin of victory, and are often said to give the newly [[Election|elected]] [[Government in exile|government]] or elected official an implicit mandate to put into effect certain [[policies]].&lt;ref&gt;Glossary | Elections ACT. Jul 2012. http://www.elections.act.gov.au/glossary (cf., ''The Government's claim that once elected they have the right and responsibility to implement their policies''.)&lt;/ref&gt; When a government seeks re-election they may introduce new policies as part of the campaign and are hoping for approval from the voters, and say they are seeking a "new mandate".

In some languages, a 'mandate' can mean a parliamentary seat won in an election rather than the electoral victory itself. In case such a mandate is bound to the wishes of the electorate, it is an [[imperative mandate]], otherwise it is called "free".

'''Policy analysis''' is a technique used in [[public administration]] to enable [[civil servant]]s, [[Activism|activists]], and others to examine and evaluate the available options to implement the goals of laws and elected officials. The process is also used in the administration of large organizations with complex policies. It has been defined as the process of "determining which of various [[Policy|policies]] will achieve a given set of goals in light of the relations between the policies and the goals."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1960s.

==Approaches==
Various approaches to policy analysis exist. The analysis ''for'' policy (and analysis ''of'' policy) is the central approach in [[social science]] and educational policy studies. It is linked to two different traditions of policy analysis and research frameworks. The approach of analysis ''for'' policy refers to research conducted for actual policy development, often commissioned by policymakers inside the bureaucracy (e.g., senior civil servants) within which the policy is developed. Analysis ''of'' policy is more of an academic exercise, conducted by academic researchers, professors and [[think tank]] researchers, who are often seeking to understand why a particular policy was developed at a particular time and assess the effects, intended or otherwise, of that policy when it was implemented.&lt;ref&gt;Khorsandi Taskoh, Ali. [http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3340&amp;context=etd A Critical Policy Analysis of Internationalization in Postsecondary Education: An Ontario Case Study], ''The University of Western Ontario'', October 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three approaches that can be distinguished: the analysis-centric, the policy process, and the meta-policy approach.&lt;ref name="Bührs93"/&gt;

===Analysis-centric===
The analysis-centric (or "analycentric") approach focuses on individual problems and their solutions. Its scope is the micro-scale and its problem interpretation or problem resolution usually involves a technical solution. The primary aim is to identify the most effective and efficient solution in technical and economic terms (e.g. the most efficient allocation of resources).

===Policy process===
The policy process approach puts its focal point onto political processes and involved [[stakeholder analysis|stakeholders]]; its scope is the broader meso-scale and it interprets problems using a political lens (i.e., the interests and goals of elected officials). It aims at determining what processes, means and policy instruments (e.g., [[regulation]], [[legislation]], [[subsidy]]) are used. As well, it tries to explain the role and influence of stakeholders within the policy process &lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2015).  Making policy connections across scales using nexus analysis. In F.M. Hult &amp; D.C Johnson (Eds.), &lt;i&gt;Research methods in language policy and planning: A practical guide&lt;/i&gt; (pp. 217-231). Malden, MA: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;. In the 2010s, ''stakeholders'' is defined broadly to include citizens, community groups, non-governmental organizations, businesses and even opposing political parties. By changing the relative power and influence of certain groups (e.g., enhancing public participation and consultation), solutions to problems may be identified that have more "buy in" from a wider group. One way of doing this followed a [[heuristic]] model called the ''[[Policy#Policy cycle|policy cycle]]''. In its simplest form, the policy cycle, which is often depicted visually as a loop or circle, starts with the identification of the problem, proceeds to an examination of the different policy tools that could be used to respond to that problem, then goes on to the implementation stage, in which one or more policies are put into practice (e.g., a new regulation or subsidy is set in place), and then finally, once the policy has been implemented and run for a certain period, the policy is evaluated. A number of different viewpoints can be used during evaluation, including looking at a policy's effectiveness, [[cost-effectiveness]], value for money, outcomes or outputs.

===Meta-policy===
The meta-policy approach is a systems and context approach; i.e., its scope is the macro-scale and its problem interpretation is usually of a structural nature. It aims at explaining the contextual factors of the policy process; i.e., what the political, economic and socio-cultural factors are that influence it. As problems may result because of structural factors (e.g., a certain economic system or political institution), solutions may entail changing the structure itself.

==Methodology==
Policy analysis uses both [[qualitative methods]] and [[quantitative methods]]. Qualitative research includes [[case studies]] and interviews with community members. Quantitative research includes [[survey research]], [[statistical analysis]] (also called ''data analysis'') and [[model building]]. A common practice is to define the problem and evaluation criteria; identify and evaluate alternatives; and recommend a certain policy accordingly. Promotion of the best agendas are the product of careful "back-room" analysis of policies by ''[[a priori knowledge|a priori]]'' assessment and ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' evaluation.

===Dimensions for analyzing policies===
There are six dimensions to policy analysis categorized as the effects and implementation of the policy across a period of time. Also collectively known as "Durability" of the policy, which means the capacity in content of the policy to produce visible effective compatible change or results over time with robustness.&lt;ref&gt;Salamon, M.Lester (2002). "The New Governance and the Tools of Public Action: An Introduction", 'The Tools of Government - A guide to the new governance',1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Effects'''
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Effectiveness''' || What effects does the policy have on the targeted problem?
|-
| '''Unintended effects'''&lt;ref&gt;Rychetnik et al., 2002&lt;/ref&gt; || What are the [[unintended effects]] of this policy?
|-
| '''Equity'''&lt;ref&gt;Potvin et al., 2008&lt;/ref&gt; || What are the effects of this policy on different population groups?
|}

'''Implementation'''
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Cost''' || What is the financial cost of this policy (some analysts also include [[tax credit]]s in this analysis)?
|-
| '''Feasibility''' || Is the policy technically feasible?
|-
| '''Acceptability'''&lt;ref&gt;Peters, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; || Do the relevant policy stakeholders view the policy as acceptable?
|}

The strategic effects dimensions can pose certain limitations due to data collection. However the analytical dimensions of effects directly influences acceptability. The degree of acceptability is based upon the plausible definitions of actors involved in feasibility. If the feasibility dimension is compromised, it will put the implementation at risk, which will entail additional costs. Finally, implementation dimensions collectively influence a policy's ability to produce results or impacts.

===Five-E approach===
One model of policy analysis is the "five-E approach", which consists of examining a policy in terms of:&lt;ref name="Kirst-Ashman"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bHQcCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |series=Empowerment Series |title=Introduction to Social Work &amp; Social Welfare: Critical Thinking Perspectives |first=Karen K. |last=Kirst-Ashman |publisher=Cengage Learning |date=January 1, 2016 |pages=234–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Effectiveness: How well does it work (or how well will it be predicted to work)?
;Efficiency: How much work does or will it entail? Are there significant costs associated with this solution, and are they worth it?
;[[Ethics|Ethical]] considerations: Is it ethically and morally sound?  Are there [[unintended consequences]]?
;Evaluations of alternatives: How good is it compared to other approaches?  Have all the relevant other approaches been considered?
;Establishment of recommendations for positive change: What can actually be implemented? Is it better to amend, replace, remove, or add a policy?

===Framework===
Policies are considered as frameworks that can optimize the general well-being. These are commonly analyzed by legislative bodies and lobbyists. Every policy analysis is intended to bring an evaluative outcome. A systemic policy analysis is meant for in depth study for addressing a social problem. Following are steps in a policy analysis:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jillian Jimenez|author2=Eileen Mayers Pasztor|author3=Ruth M. Chambers |author4=Cheryl Pearlman Fujii |title=Social Policy and Social Change: Toward the Creation of Social and Economic Justice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hU0XBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25|date=2014|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4833-2415-9|pages=25–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Defining the problem assessed by the policy.
# Assessing policy objectives and its target populations.
# Studying effects of the policy.
# Policy implications: distribution of resources, changes in services rights and statuses, tangible benefits. 
# Alternative policies: surveying existing and possible policy models that could have addressed the problem better or parts of it which could make it effective.

==Evidence based models==
Many models exist to analyze the development and implementation of [[public policy]]. Analysts use these models to identify important aspects of policy, as well as explain and predict policy and its consequences. Each of these models are based upon the types of policies.

===Types===
* Government (e.g. federal, provincial, municipal)
* Policies adopted within public institutions (e.g. hospitals, child care centers, schools)
* Workplace (e.g. policies that govern employees and employee-manager relations)&lt;ref&gt;Kim Bergeron, Florence Morestin et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some evidence supported models are:

===Governments===

Public policy is determined by a range of political institutions, which give policy [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] to policy measures. In general, the government applies policy to all citizens and monopolizes the use of force in applying or implementing policy (through government control of [[law enforcement]], [[court]] systems, [[imprisonment]] and [[armed forces]]). The [[legislature]], [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[judicial]] branches of government are examples of institutions that give policy legitimacy. Many countries also have independent, quasi-independent or [[arm's length]] bodies which, while funded by government, are independent from elected officials and political leaders. These organizations may include government [[commission (remuneration)|commission]]s, [[tribunal]]s, [[regulation|regulatory agencies]] and electoral commissions.

====Process model====
{{See also|Policy#Policy cycle|l1=Policy cycle}}

Policy creation is a process that typically follows a sequence of steps or stages:
* Identification of a problem (also called "problem definition") and demand for government action. Different stakeholders may define the same issue as different problems. For example, if [[homelessness|homeless people]] are using [[illegal drug]]s such as [[heroin]] in a city park, some stakeholders may define this as a [[law enforcement]] issue (which, in their view, could be best solved if police presence in the park is stepped up and if the individuals using illegal drugs are arrested and punished); on the other hand, other stakeholders may view this as a [[poverty]] and [[public health]] issue (which, in their view, could be best solved if [[public health nurse]]s and government [[medical doctor]]s and [[substance abuse]] counsellors were sent to the park to do [[outreach]] with the drug-using individuals, and encourage them to voluntarily enter "[[detoxification]]" or [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] programs).
* Agenda setting
* Formulation of policy proposals by various parties (e.g., citizen groups, congressional committees, [[think tank]]s, [[interest group]]s, [[lobby group]]s, [[non-governmental organization]]s).
* Policy selection/adoption and legal enactment of a selected policy by elected officials and/or houses of representatives. At this stage, '''policy legitimation''' is conferred upon the selected policy solution(s).
* Policy implementation, which involves [[civil servant]]s putting the selected policy option into practice. Depending on the choice made by the executive or legislative branch, this could involve creating new [[regulation]] (or [[Deregulation|removing existing regulations]]), creating new laws, creating a new government program or service, creating a new [[subsidy]] or [[grant (money)|grant]], etc.
* Policy [[evaluation]]. After the policy has been in place for a year or several years, [[civil servant]]s or an independent [[consulting firm]] assesses the policy, to see if the goals were achieved, if the policy was implemented effectively, etc.

This model, however, has been criticized for being overly linear and simplistic.&lt;ref&gt;Young, John and Enrique Mendizabal. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=1127&amp;title=become-policy-entrepreneur-roma Helping researchers become policy entrepreneurs], [[Overseas Development Institute]], London, September 2009. &lt;!--accessed 07 October 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, stages of the policy process may overlap or never happen. Also, this model fails to take into account the multiple factors attempting to influence the process itself as well as each other, and the complexity this entails.

===For public institutions===

One of the most widely used model for public institutions are of [[Herbert A. Simon]], the father of rational models. It is also used by private corporations. However, many criticise the model due to characteristics of the model being impractical and relying on unrealistic assumptions. For instance, it is a difficult model to apply in the public sector because social problems can be very complex, ill-defined and interdependent. The problem lies in the thinking procedure implied by the model which is linear and can face difficulties in extraordinary problems or social problems which have no sequences of happenings.

====Rational model====
:''See [[Rational planning model]] for a fuller discussion''

The rational model of decision-making is a process for making sound decisions in policy-making in the public sector. Rationality is defined as “a style of behavior that is appropriate to the achievement of given goals, within the limits imposed by given conditions and constraints”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Herbert, Simon |title=[[Administrative Behavior]] |publisher=The Free Press |location=New York |year=1976 |edition=3rd |isbn=0-684-83582-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note the model makes a series of assumptions, such as: 'The model must be applied in a system that is stable'; 'The government is a rational and unitary actor and that its actions are perceived as rational choices'; 'The policy problem is unambiguous'; 'There are no limitations of time or cost'.

Furthermore, in the context of the public sector policy models are intended to achieve maximum social gain. Simon identifies an outline of a step by step mode of analysis to achieve rational decisions. Ian Thomas describes Simon's steps as follows:

#Intelligence gathering — A comprehensive organization of data; potential problems and opportunities are identified, collected and analyzed.
#Identifying problems — Accounting for relevant factors.
#Assessing the consequences of all options — Listing possible consequences and alternatives that could resolve the problem and ranking the probability that each potential factor could materialize in order to give a correct priority to said factor in the analysis.
#Relating consequences to values — With all policies there will be a set of relevant dimensional values (for example, economic feasibility and environmental protection) and a set of criteria for appropriateness, against which performance (or consequences) of each option being responsive can be judged.
#Choosing the preferred option — The policy is brought through from fully understanding the problems, opportunities, all the consequences &amp; the criteria of the tentative options and by selecting an optimal alternative with consensus of involved actors.&lt;ref name=Thomas07&gt;{{cite book |editor=Thomas, Ian |title=Environmental Policy: Australian Practice in the Context of Theory |publisher=Federation Press |location=Sydney |year=2007 |isbn=1-86287-603-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model of rational decision-making has also proven to be very useful to several decision making processes in industries outside the public sphere. Nonetheless, there are some who criticize the rational model due to the major problems which can be faced &amp; which tend to arise in practice because social and environmental values can be difficult to quantify and forge consensus around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1005469411776 |author1=Morgan M.G. |author2=Kandlikar M. |author3=Risbey J. |author4=Dowlatabadi H. |title=Why Conventional Tools for Policy Analysis Are Often Inadequate for Problems of Global Change |journal=Climatic Change |volume=41 |issue=3-4 |pages=271–281 |date=19 March 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the assumptions stated by Simon are never fully valid in a real world context.

Further criticism of the rational model include: leaving a gap between planning and implementation, ignoring of the role of people, entrepreneurs, leadership, etc., the insufficiency of technical competence (i.e. ignoring the human factor), reflecting too mechanical an approach (i.e. the organic nature of organizations), requiring of multidimensional and complex models, generation of predictions which are often wrong (i.e. simple solutions may be overlooked), &amp; incurring of cost (i.e. costs of rational-comprehensive planning may outweigh the cost savings of the policy).

However, Thomas R. Dye, the president of the Lincoln Center for Public Service, states the rational model provides a good perspective since in modern society rationality plays a central role and everything that is rational tends to be prized. Thus, it does not seem strange that “we ought to be trying for rational decision-making”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dye, Thomas R. |title=Understanding Public Policy |publisher=Prentice Hall |edition=12th |year=2007 |isbn=0-13-936948-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Incremental policy====
{{More|Incrementalism}}
An incremental policy model relies on features of incremental decision-making such as: satisfying, organizational drift, bounded rationality, and limited cognition, among others. Such policies are often called "muddling through" &amp; represent a conservative tendency: new policies are only slightly different from old policies. Policy-makers are too short on time, resources, and brains to make totally new policies; as such, past policies are accepted as having some legitimacy. When existing policies have sunk costs which discourage innovation, incrementalism is an easier approach than rationalism, and the policies are more politically expedient because they don't necessitate any radical redistribution of values. Such models necessarily struggle to improve the acceptability of public policy.

Criticisms of such a policy approach include: challenges to bargaining (i.e. not successful with limited resources), downplaying useful quantitative information, obscuring real relationships between political entities, an anti-intellectual approach to problems (i.e. the preclusion of imagination), and a bias towards conservatism (i.e. bias against far-reaching solutions).

===For workplaces===
There are many contemporary policies relevant to gender and workplace issues. Actors analyze contemporary gender-related employment issues ranging from parental leave and maternity programs, sexual harassment, and work/life balance to gender mainstreaming. It is by the juxtaposition of a variety of research methodologies focused on a common theme the richness of understanding is gained. This integrates what are usually separate bodies of evaluation on the role of gender in welfare state developments, employment transformations, workplace policies, and work experience.

====Group model====
This policy is formed as a result of forces and pressures from influential groups. Pressure groups are informally co-opted into the policy making process. Regulatory agencies are captured by those they are supposed to regulate. No one group is dominant all the time on all issues. The group is the bridge between the individual and the administration. The executive is thus pressured by interest groups.

The task of the system is to:
* Establish the rules of the game
* Arrange compromises and balance interests
* Enact compromises in policy
* Enforce these compromises.

====Other====
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}
There are several other major types of policy analysis, broadly groupable into competing approaches:

*Empirical versus normative policy analyses
*Retrospective versus prospective analyses
*Prescriptive versus descriptive analyses.

===Techniques used in policy analysis===
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}
*Cost–benefit analysis
*[[Management by objectives]] (MBO)
*Operations research
*Decision-making based on analytics
*[[Program evaluation and review technique]] (PERT)
*[[Critical path method]] (CPM).

==Evaluation==
The success of a policy can be measured by changes in the behavior of the target population and active support from various actors and institutions involved. A public policy is an authoritative communication prescribing an unambiguous course of action for specified individuals or groups in certain situations. There must be an authority or leader charged with the implementation and monitoring of the policy with a sound social theory underlying the program and the target group. Evaluations can help estimate what effects will be produced by program objectives/alternatives.  However, [[Correlation does not imply causation|claims of causality]] can only be made with [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized control trials]] in which the policy change is applied to one group and not applied to a control group and individuals are randomly assigned to these groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Social and Behavioral Sciences Team 2016 Annual Report|journal=Executive Office of the President National Science and Technology Council|date=2016|url=https://sbst.gov/download/2016%20SBST%20Annual%20Report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haynes|first1=Laura|title=Test, Learn, Adapt: Developing Public Policy with Randomized Controlled Trials|journal=United Kingdom Cabinet Office Behavioral Insights Team|date=2012|url=http://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/id/eprint/201256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using Randomized Control Trials to Evaluate Public Policy|url=https://innovation.govspace.gov.au/using-randomised-control-trials-evaluate-public-policy|publisher=Australian Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To obtain compliance of the actors involved, the government can resort to positive sanctions, such as favorable publicity, price supports, tax credits, grants-in-aid, direct services or benefits; declarations; rewards; voluntary standards; mediation; education; demonstration programs; training, contracts; subsidies; loans; general expenditures; informal procedures, bargaining; franchises; sole-source provider awards...etc.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle A.

===Steps for conducting a policy evaluation===
Policy evaluation is used to examine content, implementation or impact of the policy, which helps to understand the merit, worth and the utility of the policy. Following are National Collaborating Centre for Healthy Public Policy's (NCCHPP) 10 steps:&lt;ref&gt;Morestin, F. and Castonguay, J. (2013).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2765">The End Use Energy Demand (EUED) Centres carry out interdisciplinary research and advise policy on reducing [[energy demand]] to help achieve the [[Energy in the United Kingdom|UK government's CO2 emissions targets]]. The Centres are a £30m investment of the [[Research Councils]] UK Energy Programme (with additional funding from industrial partners) that run from 2013-2018. The six large centres are based across 25 institutions and encompass over 200 researchers.

== The Centres ==
The Centres are:

'''Centre for Energy Epidemiology (CEE) -''' Based at [[University College London]] and directed by Professor [[Tadj Oreszczyn]].

'''Centre on Innovation and Energy Demand (CIED) -''' Based at the [[University of Sussex]] and directed by Professor [[Benjamin Sovacool]].

'''Centre for Industrial Energy, Materials and Products (CIE-MAP) -''' Based at the [[University of Leeds]] and directed by Professor [[Professor John Barrett|John Barrett]].

'''Centre for Sustainable Energy Use in Food Chains (CSEF) -''' Based at [[Brunel University]] and led by Professor Savvas Tassou.

'''Dynamics of Energy, Mobility and Demand (DEMAND) -''' Based at the [[University of Lancaster]] and led by Professor [[Elizabeth Shove]].

'''Interdisciplinary Centre for Storage, Transformation and Upgrading of Thermal Energy (i-STUTE) -''' Based at the [[University of Warwick]] and directed by Professor [[Robert Critoph]].

== Background ==
The [[UK]] is committed to achieving large-scale reductions (80%) in [[greenhouse gas emissions]] by 2050 ([[Climate Change Act]] (1990)). End Use Energy Demand (EUED) research is about reducing energy use on the scale needed to reach this target, whilst maintaining current or achieving better standards of living and economic growth. The EUED Centres were funded in 2013 following a 2011 call for proposals from the Research Councils UK Energy Programme to address these issues.

'''Centralisation''' (British) or '''centralization''' (both British and American) is the process by which the activities of an organization, particularly those regarding planning and decision-making, become concentrated within a particular geographical location  group. This moves the important decision-making and planning powers within the center of the organisation.

The term has a variety of meanings in several fields. In [[political science]], centralisation refers to the concentration of a government's power—both geographically and politically—into a [[centralized government]].

==Centralisation in politics==

===History of the centralisation of authority===
''Centralisation of authority'' is defined as the systematic and consistent concentration of authority at a central point or in a person within the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Acharya, A. (2012). ''What are the advantages and disadvantages of centralization of authority ?.'' [online] Preservearticles.com. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.preservearticles.com/201101143291/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-centralisation-of-authority.html&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 4 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was first introduced in the [[Qin Dynasty]] of China. The Qin government was highly bureaucratic and was administered by a hierarchy of officials, all serving the First Emperor, [[Qin Shi Huang]].&lt;ref&gt;Ancientmilitary.com, (2012). ''Ancient China Government.'' [online] Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ancientmilitary.com/ancient-china-government.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 5 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt; The Qin Dynasty practised all the things that [[Han Fei]]zi taught, allowing Qin Shi Huang to own and control all his territories, including those conquered from other countries. Zheng and his advisers ended feudalism in China by setting up new laws and regulations under a centralized and bureaucratic government with a rigid centralization of authority. Under this system, both the military and government thrived. This was because talented individuals were more easily identified and picked out to be trained for specialized functions.&lt;ref&gt;Bachman, D., Bickers, R., Carter, J., de Weert, H., Elders, C., Entenmann, R. and Felton, M. (2007). ''World and Its Peoples: Eastern and Southern Asia. New York: Marshall Cavendish'', p.36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Features of centralisation of authority in ancient Chinese government===
* The monarchical power is the supreme power in the empire. The emperor monopolizes all the resources in the country; his personality and abilities decide the prosperity of the country. This autocratic system allows for faster decision-making and avoids complex solutions to problems that arise. One disadvantage is that courtiers, who compete for the emperor's favor, are able to amass power for themselves, leading to internal strife.(Jin and Liu, 1992)&lt;ref&gt;Jin, G. and Liu, Q. (1992). ''The Cycle of Growth and Decline - On the Ultrastable Structure of Chinese Society: Chapter 7''. 2nd ed. Hong Kong: The Chinese University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The administrative department has highly centralized power. The duties of each bureaucratic occupation are not clearly defined, leading to inefficiencies as functionaries manage the government and effectively rule the country.

===Idea of centralisation of authority===
The acts for the implementation are needed after delegation. Therefore, the authority for taking the decisions can be spread with the help of the delegation of the authority.

The centralisation of authority can be done immediately, if complete concentration is given at the decision-making stage for any position. The centralisation can be done with a position or at a level in an organisation. Ideally, the decision-making power is held by a few individuals.

===Advantages and disadvantages of the centralisation of authority===
Centralisation of authority has several advantages and disadvantages. The benefits include:

# Responsibilities and duties are well defined within the central governing body.
# Decision-making is very direct and clear.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Singh, K. (2015). ''What is Centralization and De-Centralization of the Authority? | Total MBA Guide.'' [online] Mbaofficial.com. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.mbaofficial.com/mba-courses/principles-of-management/what-is-centralization-and-de-centralization-of-the-authority/&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 4 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;
# The central power maintains a large "encompassing interest" in the welfare of the state it rules since it stands to benefit from any increase in the state's wealth and/or power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Mancur|date=1993-01-01|title=Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development|jstor=2938736|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=87|issue=3|pages=567–576|doi=10.2307/2938736}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the incentives of state and ruler are aligned.

Disadvantages, on the other hand are as follows:

# Decisions may be misunderstood while being passed on and lower position departments do not have the decision-making power, therefore it requires an efficient and well-organized top department.
# Attention and support for each department or city may not be balanced.
# Delay of work information may result in inefficiency of the government.
# Discrepancies in the economy and information resources between the centre and other places are significant.&lt;ref&gt;Fujii, G. (2010). ''藤井厳喜WEBサイト | Fujii's Focus For Future 公式ブログ.'' [online] Gemki-fujii.com. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.gemki-fujii.com/blog/2010/000641.html&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 4 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;
# Excludes actors at the local and provincial levels from the prevailing system of governance, reducing the capacity of the central government to resolve disputes or design effective policies requiring local knowledge and expertise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sawyer|first=Amos|date=2004-09-01|title=Violent conflicts and governance challenges in West Africa: the case of the Mano River basin area|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-modern-african-studies/article/violent-conflicts-and-governance-challenges-in-west-africa-the-case-of-the-mano-river-basin-area/05EB21C20F63C87E8E9319952E5A6455|journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies|volume=42|issue=3|pages=437–463|doi=10.1017/S0022278X04000266|issn=1469-7777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Centralisation in economy==
===Relationship between centralisation (i.e. concentration of production) and capitalism===
{{Main|Capitalism#Concentration and centralisation|Capital accumulation#Concentration and centralization}}
As written in V.I. Lenin’s book, ''Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism'', "The remarkably rapid concentration of production in ever-larger enterprises are one of the most characteristic features of capitalism."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lenin, V. (1939). ''Imperialism, the highest stage of capitalism.'' New York: International Publishers,  pp.12-54.&lt;/ref&gt; He researched the development of production and decided to develop the concept of production as a centralised framework, from individual and scattered small workshops into large factories, leading the capitalism to the world. This is guided by the idea that once concentration of production develops into a particular level, it will become a monopoly, like party organisations of Cartel, Syndicate, and Trust.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Cartel - In economics, a cartel is an agreement between competing firms to control prices or exclude entry of a new competitor in a market. It is a formal organisation of sellers or buyers that agree to fix selling prices, purchase prices, or reduce production using a variety of tactics.&lt;ref&gt;O’Sullivan, A. and Sheffrin, S. (2003). ''Economics.'' Needham, Mass.: Prentice Hall, p.171.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Syndicate - A syndicate is a self-organising group made up of individuals, companies, corporations or entities formed to transact some specific business, to pursue or promote a shared interest.
*Trust - "A trust is . . . simply the case of one person holding the title of property, whether land or chattels, for the benefit of another, termed a beneficiary. Nothing can be more common or more useful. But the word is now loosely applied to a certain class, of commercial agreements and, by reason of a popular and unreasoning dread of their effect, the term itself has become contaminated."&lt;ref&gt;Theodore, D. (1888). "The Legality of "Trusts". ''Political Science Quarterly'', 3(592).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Centralisation in business studies==
Most businesses deal with issues relating to the specifics of centralization or decentralization of decision-making. The key question is either whether the authority should manage all the things at the centre of a business (centralised), or whether it should be delegated far away from the centre (decentralised).

The choice between centralised or decentralised varies. Many large businesses necessarily involve some extent of decentralisation and some extent of centralisation when it begins to operate from several places or any new units and markets added.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, J. (2014). ''Centralised versus decentralised structures | Business | tutor2u.'' [online] Beta.tutor2u.net. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://beta.tutor2u.net/business/reference/centralised-versus-decentralised-structures&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 5 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Features of centralisation in management===
# Top level managers concentrate and reserve the decision-making power.
# Execution decided by the top level management with the help from the other levels of management.
# Lower levels management do the jobs which directed and controlled by the top managers.'''(BMS Team, 2013)'''&lt;ref&gt;BMS Team, (2013). ''Important Features of centralization | BMS.co.in.'' [online] BMS.co.in : Bachelor of Management Studies. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.bms.co.in/important-features-of-centralization/&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 5 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Policy learning''' is the increased understanding that occurs when policymakers compare one set of [[policy]] problems to others within their own or in other [[jurisdiction]]s. It can aid in understanding why a policy was implemented, the policy's effects, and how the policy could apply to the policymakers' [[jurisdiction]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford handbook of public policy|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=MyccCgBfKaMC}}|last1=Moran|first1=Michael|last2=Rein|first2=Martin|last3=Goodin|first3=Robert|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-926928-0|location=USA, New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before a policy is adopted it goes through a process that involves various combinations of elected [[official]](s), political parties, [[Civil service|civil servants]], [[advocacy group]]s, policy [[expert]]s or [[consultant]]s, [[corporation]]s, [[think tank]]s, and multiple levels of government. Policies can be challenged in various ways, including  questioning its [[legality]]. Ideally policymakers develop complete knowledge about the policy; the policy should achieve its intent and efficiently use resources.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dolowitz|first=David|last2=Marsh|first2=David|year=2000|title=Learning from Abroad: The Role of Policy Transfer in Contemporary Policy - Making|url=http://journals2.scholarsportal.info.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/details/09521895/v13i0001/5_lfatropticp.xml|journal=Governance: An International Journal of Policy and Administration|volume=13|pages=5–24|via=Scholars Portal Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How policymakers learn ==

In the 1960s [[Academy (educational institution)|academics]] started to study how policymakers learn about policies. During that time countries were experiencing [[social]], [[Politics|political]], [[Economy|economic]] and [[technological change]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Researchers discovered that governments in different countries faced similar problems in policies and programs amidst uncertainty on how to handle problems in [[Finance|financing]] its [[welfare]] programs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Policymakers start to learn about policy through facts, first-hand experiences or from the experiences of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dobbin|first=Frank|last2=Simmons|first2=Beth|last3=Garrett|first3=Geoffery|year=2007|title=The Global Diffusion of Public Policies: Social Construction, Coercion, Competition, or Learning?|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=33|pages=449–472|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.33.090106.142507}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Knowledge and Policy Change|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ecMwBwAAQBAJ}}|last=Lindberg|first=Henrik|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4438-4232-7|location=United Kingdom|pages=62–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Policy instruments and policy implementation are the steps to policy learning.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to the Policy Process Theories, Concepts and Models of Public Policy Making|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=giw8dRLqX74C}}|last=Birkland|first=Thomas|publisher=M.E. Sharpe, Inc.|year=2011|isbn=978-0-7656-2532-8|location=Armonk, New York, United States of America|pages=228–286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Policymakers review policy [[Goal|objectives]], tools and implementation strategies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; When implementations fail, reviews look for the cause(s). Adjustments in objectives, tools and implementation are considered.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Instrumental policy learning ==

Instrumental policy learning is the acquisition of knowledge about the effectiveness of various policy instruments and implementatiions, Policymakers must make choices about the appropriate policy intervention tool(s) to use.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The intent is to discover the most effective tool(s) that consume the least [[resource]]s.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond Policy Analysis Public Issue Management In Turbulent Times|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=aQS1NAEACAAJ}}|last=Pal|first=Leslie|publisher=International Thomason Publishing|year=1997|isbn=978-0-17-604946-1|location=Scarborough, Ontario, Canada|pages=101–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Policymakers can employ seven major policy instrument types. 

* Direct provision–services that governments provide directly, such as publicly operated [[school]]s
* [[Subsidy|Subsidies]]–cash infusions given by government to reduce the cost for the producer or consumer such as dairy farmers who receive [[Subsidy|subsidies]] to keep consumer costs low. 
* T[[tax|axation]]–collection of money from individuals and/or businesses, such as a [[value-added tax]]. 
* [[Contract]]–an agreement between a government and a private entity to provide goods or services. 
* [[Authority]]–government action implementing legislation with accompanying enforcement.
* [[Regulation]]–government action driven by administrative action rather than legislation, governing domains such as the environment and public health. (Some private groups regulate themselves independent of the government.)
* Exhortation–encouragement without coercion, such as campaigns against littering or encouraging fire prevention.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

After choosing a policy instrument, the details for employing the instrument must be arranged.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Implementation carries risks of failing in various ways, such as ineffectiveness, unacceptable delays and excessive costs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Practices that improve success rates include setting reasonable expectations, allowing adequate time and sufficient resources, having clear communication and u nderstanding policy objectives, minimizing the number of approvals, simplifying management structures and aligning all relevant groups around the implementation, along with mechanisms to adapt the implementation in accord with subsequent experience to correct problems and take advantage of new opportunities.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Top-down approach ===

The top-down approach involves allowing high-level policymakers set objectives and define implementation strategies. Lower level implementers carry out the policy.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; Objectives must be clearly defined and the implementation tools must be selected based on the implementation strategy. Policy designers need to assess the commitment of policy [[Implementation|implementers]] who could be [[Teacher|teachers,]] [[Police officer|police officers,]] [[social work]]ers or private sector workers.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

One example of the top-down approach was in 1973 when the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] passed a policy limiting the driving speed to 55&amp;nbsp;mph on America’s freeways under the [[National Maximum Speed Law]].&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; The policy objective was to reduce gasoline consumption. In addition to increased travel times, a side effect was the reduction of freeway fatalities.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; 

=== Bottom-up approach ===

The bottom-up approach helps policymakers to evaluate whether policy goals are open to more than one interpretation.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; Does the policy implement a statute, or reflect rules, practices and/or norms such as energy policy or criminal procedure? Are the policy goals internally consistent? How will the policy affect the activities of workers who directly provide services?&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; Bottom-up approaches require policymakers to involve both service providers and service recipients in refining goals, strategies and activities. This bottom-up approach starts from consumer-facing bureaucrats and moves up to the top policymakers. Should the policy face pushback, policymakers must be open to negotiations for a compromise approach.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sabatier|first=Paul|year=1986|title=Top - down and Bottom - up Approaches to Implementation Research: A Critical Analysis and Suggested Synthesis|jstor=3998354|journal=Journal of Public Policy|volume=6|issue=1|pages=21–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bottom-up approach emphasizes low level policy implementers, but policy learners must not attempt to frustrate the goals of top policymakers.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

In America, the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] (NCLB) adopted policyies that would have benefited from bottom-up perspectives.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dewayne|first=Matthews|year=2004|title=No Child Left Behind: The Challenge of Implementation|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=7b20e4b2-2648-479d-a8b0-2c6f3ee67474%40sessionmgr120&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=125|journal=Spectrum: Journal of State Government|volume=77|pages=11–14|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; When NCLB was passed, many states struggled to figure out what was required. All states had to get their education plans approved by [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]].&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; Once the education plan was approved, each state had to incorporate NCLB into the state's framework of educational governance and to use the [[legislation]] to achieve the state's own goals.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; If the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] had consulted with each state about its education policies, performances, and future goals, teachers and the government would have had a better understanding on what policy objectives were achievable.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt;

== Challenges ==

Policy learning has not been embraced in some countries. Some countries that were once [[Colonization|colonized]] fear that embracing policies recommended by outsiders will allow other countries to exploit their resources. [[David Rockefeller|Rockefeller]] (1966) claimed that in [[Latin America]] in the early 1960s free-market policies were in competition with [[Communism|communist]] [[propaganda]] in [[Latin America]]n countries. At the time American business were claimed to be exploiting the people and their resources. However, companies such as [[Chase Bank|Chase Manhattan Bank]] launched a program in [[Panama]] to improve [[cattle]] raising by training ranchersr to follow the scientific advances of seeding, feeding and breeding cattle more effectively. This process improved the quality of [[beef]], which encouraged higher meat consumption, improved [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary]] standards and made [[Panama]] a beef [[export]]er.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rockefeller|first=David|year=1966|title=What Private Enterprise Means to Latin America|url=https://www.jstor.org.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/stable/pdf/20039176.pdf|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=44|pages=403–416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European countries created the [[Euro]] to simplify [[Trade|trading]] between [[European Union]] countries.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Macroeconomics 7th Edition|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=5CB0DAAAQBAJ}} |last=Blanchard|first=Olivier|publisher=Pearson|year=2016|isbn=9780133838121|location=Canada|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adopting the Euro would remove currency risk and the cost of currency conversion, and provide a common [[monetary policy]] among members. Policy learning took places as more [[Europe]]an countries learned that joining the [[Eurozone]] would give them access to other markets.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; Citizens of EU member countries could travel to other EU countries within the [[Schengen Area|Schengen area]] without transiting a border checkpoint. The learning did not reach all policy sectors. Some EU countries kept their budgets in near balance amid strong growth and employment, while others' budgets were so far out of balance that their overall debt created fears about their ability to make their payments.

This is a list of articles about [[terms of service]] and [[privacy policies]]. These are also called terms of use, and are rules one must agree to, in order to use a service. The articles fall in two main categories: descriptions of terms used for specific companies or products, and descriptions of different kinds of terms in general. Articles on companies vary widely in the amount of detail they give on terms of service. Annotations show what is available in the article on each company, and need to be updated as those articles are improved.

Terms of service are regularly the subject of news articles throughout the English-language press, such as in the US,&lt;ref name="ny14"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/upshot/one-third-of-top-websites-restrict-customers-right-to-sue.html |title=One-Third of Top Websites Restrict Customers' Right to Sue |last=Merrill |first=Jeremy B. |date=23 October 2014 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2017-09-11 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ny17"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/technology/uber-greyball-program-evade-authorities.html |title=How Uber Deceives the Authorities Worldwide |last=Isaac |first=Mike |date=3 March 2017 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2017-09-11 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ti12"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://business.time.com/2012/08/28/7-surprising-things-lurking-in-online-terms-of-service-agreements/ |title=7 Surprising Things Lurking in Online 'Terms of Service' Agreements |last=Luckerson |first=Victor |work=Time |access-date=2017-09-11 |language=en-US |issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/story/zoe-quinn-crash-override-book-excerpt/ |title=Book Excerpt: Zoë Quinn on the Problem of Terms of Service |last=Quinn |first=Zoe |date=9 September 2017 |work=WIRED |access-date=2017-09-11 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; UK,&lt;ref name="gu17"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/03/terms-of-service-online-contracts-fine-print |title=Click to agree with what?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3636">The '''Imperative mandate''' is a political system in which "representatives enact policies in accordance with mandates and can be recalled by people’s assemblies".&lt;ref&gt;[https://ctjournal.org/index.php/criticaltimes/article/view/15/10 Who’s Afraid of the Imperative Mandate?], Massimiliano Tomba, ''Critical Times', 1(1), 2018&lt;/ref&gt; It requires a  context in which "power is not monopolized by the state, but distributed in a plurality of municipalities and assemblies with specific political authority".&lt;ref&gt;[https://ctjournal.org/index.php/criticaltimes/article/view/15/10 Who’s Afraid of the Imperative Mandate?], Massimiliano Tomba, ''Critical Times', 1(1), 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==

The imperative mandate goes back to the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ctjournal.org/index.php/criticaltimes/article/view/15/10 Who’s Afraid of the Imperative Mandate?], Massimiliano Tomba, ''Critical Times', 1(1), 2018&lt;/ref&gt; It was embraced by the revolutionary assemblies in Paris in 1793&lt;ref&gt;[https://ctjournal.org/index.php/criticaltimes/article/view/15/10 Who’s Afraid of the Imperative Mandate?], Massimiliano Tomba, ''Critical Times', 1(1), 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  but then banned by the royalist members of the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|French National Assembly of 1789]] to block greater influence by the people.&lt;ref name=itolobook&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bu6KsWAP7ogC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=Imperative+mandate&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=mvK4TI6ELs2cOt2f7YcN&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Imperative%20mandate&amp;f=false Constitutional Culture and Democratic Rule (Murphy Institute Studies in Political Economy)] by [[John Ferejohn]], [[Jack N.

It was embraced in the [[Paris Commune]] and by the [[Council Communism]] movement.

==Contemporary Political Movements==

The Imperative Mandate has been used by the [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]] and [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] in [[South Africa]]&lt;ref&gt;''Thinking Freedom in Africa'', [[Michael Neocosmos]], Wits University Press, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]] in [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://ctjournal.org/index.php/criticaltimes/article/view/15/10 Who’s Afraid of the Imperative Mandate?], Massimiliano Tomba, ''Critical Times', 1(1), 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28420">A '''wicked problem''' is a problem that is difficult or impossible to solve because of incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements that are often difficult to recognize.  The use of the term "wicked" here has come to denote resistance to resolution, rather than evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apsc.gov.au/publications-and-media/archive/publications-archive/tackling-wicked-problems|title=Tackling Wicked Problems: A Public Policy Perspective|publisher=Australian Public Service Commission|date=25 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition is "a problem whose social complexity means that it has no determinable stopping point".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/|title=Design for Transitions - from and to what?|last=Tonkinwise|first=Cameron|date=4 April 2015|website=Academia.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, because of complex [[interdependencies]], the effort to solve one aspect of a wicked problem may reveal or create other problems.

The phrase was originally used in [[social planning]]. Its modern sense was introduced in 1967 by [[C. West Churchman]] in a guest editorial Churchman wrote in the journal ''[[Management Science (journal)|Management Science]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Management Science |last= Churchman |first= C. West |title= Wicked Problems |volume= 14 |issue= 4 |pages= B-141-B-146 |date= December 1967 |doi= 10.1287/mnsc.14.4.B141}}&lt;/ref&gt; responding to a previous use of the term by [[Horst Rittel]]. Churchman discussed the moral responsibility of [[operations research]] "to inform the manager in what respect our 'solutions' have failed to tame his wicked problems".  Rittel and [[Melvin M. Webber]] formally described the concept of wicked problems in a 1973 [[treatise]], contrasting "wicked" problems with relatively "tame", soluble problems in [[mathematics]], [[chess]], or [[puzzle]] solving.&lt;ref name="Rittel and Webber 1973" /&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Rittel and Webber's 1973 formulation of wicked problems in [[social policy]] planning specified ten characteristics:&lt;ref name="Rittel and Webber 1973"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rittel |first=Horst W. J. |first2=Melvin M. |last2=Webber |title=Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning |journal=Policy Sciences |year=1973 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=155–169 |url=http://www.uctc.net/mwebber/Rittel+Webber+Dilemmas+General_Theory_of_Planning.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930021510/http://www.uctc.net/mwebber/Rittel+Webber+Dilemmas+General_Theory_of_Planning.pdf |archive-date=30 September 2007 |doi=10.1007/bf01405730}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ritchey|2013}}

#There is no definitive formulation of a wicked problem&lt;!-- defining a wicked problem cannot itself be a wicked problem, this list is its definition, we just solved it, not so wicked after all--&gt;.
#Wicked problems have no [[stopping rule]].
#Solutions to wicked problems are not [[Principle of bivalence|true-or-false]], but better or worse.
#There is no immediate and no ultimate test of a solution to a wicked problem.
#Every solution to a wicked problem is a "one-shot operation"; because there is no opportunity to learn by [[trial and error]], every attempt counts significantly.
#Wicked problems do not have an enumerable (or an exhaustively describable) set of potential solutions, nor is there a well-described set of permissible operations that may be incorporated into the plan.
#Every wicked problem is essentially unique.
#Every wicked problem can be considered to be a symptom of another problem.
#The existence of a discrepancy representing a wicked problem can be explained in numerous ways. The choice of explanation determines the nature of the problem's resolution.
#The social planner has no right to be wrong (i.e., planners are liable for the consequences of the actions they generate).

Conklin later generalized the concept of problem wickedness to areas other than planning and policy; Conklin's defining characteristics are:&lt;ref name="Conklin 2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Conklin|first=Jeffrey|title=Dialogue mapping : building shared understanding of wicked problems|year=2006|publisher=[[Wiley Publishing]]|location=Chichester, England|isbn=978-0-470-01768-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#The problem is not understood until after the formulation of a solution.
#Wicked problems have no [[stopping rule]].
#Solutions to wicked problems are [[Many-valued_logic|not right or wrong]].
#Every wicked problem is essentially novel and unique.
#Every solution to a wicked problem is a 'one shot operation.'
#Wicked problems have no given alternative solutions.

== Examples ==
Classic examples of wicked problems include [[economic]], [[Natural environment|environmental]], and [[political]] issues. A problem whose solution requires a great number of people to change their mindsets and behavior is likely to be a wicked problem. Therefore, many standard examples of wicked problems come from the areas of public planning and policy. These include global [[climate change]],{{sfn|Hulme|2009}} [[natural hazards]], [[healthcare]], the [[AIDS]] epidemic, [[pandemic influenza]], international [[drug trafficking]], [[nuclear weapons]], [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]], waste and [[social injustice]].

In recent years, problems in many areas have been identified as exhibiting elements of wickedness; examples range from aspects of design decision making and [[knowledge management]]{{sfn|Courtney|2008}} to [[business strategy]].{{sfn|Camillus|2008}}

== Background ==
Rittel and Webber coined the term in the context of problems of social policy, an arena in which a purely scientific-engineering approach cannot be applied because of the lack of a clear problem definition and differing perspectives of stakeholders. In their words, {{Quote|The search for scientific bases for confronting problems of social policy is bound to fail because of the nature of these problems... Policy problems cannot be definitively described. Moreover, in a pluralistic society there is nothing like the indisputable public good; there is no objective definition of equity; policies that respond to [[social problem]]s cannot be meaningfully correct or false; and it makes no sense to talk about "optimal solutions" to these problems... Even worse, there are no solutions in the sense of definitive answers.&lt;ref name="Rittel and Webber 1973" /&gt;}}

Thus wicked problems are also characterised by the following:{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

# The solution depends on how the problem is framed and vice versa (i.e., the problem definition depends on the solution)
# [[Stakeholder (corporate)|Stakeholders]] have radically different [[world view]]s and different frames for understanding the problem.
# The constraints that the problem is subject to and the resources needed to solve it change over time.
# The problem is never solved definitively.

Although Rittel and Webber framed the concept in terms of social policy and planning, wicked problems occur in any domain involving stakeholders with differing perspectives.&lt;ref name="Conklin 2006" /&gt; Recognising this, Rittel and Kunz developed a technique called [[Issue-Based Information System]] (IBIS), which facilitates documentation of the rationale behind a group decision in an objective manner.&lt;ref name="Kunz and Rittel 1970"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kunz|first=Werner|title=Issues as Elements of Information Systems|year=1970|location=Heidelberg, Germany|author2=Horst W. J. Rittel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recurring theme in research and industry literature is the connection between wicked problems and design.{{sfn|Rittel|1988}}{{sfn|Stolterman|2008}} Design problems are typically wicked because they are often ill defined (no prescribed way forward), involve stakeholders with different perspectives, and have no "right" or "optimal" solution.{{sfn|Conklin|2005|loc=Chapter 1}} Thus wicked problems cannot be solved by the application of standard (or known) methods; they demand creative solutions.{{sfn|Conklin|Basadur|VanPatter|2007a}}{{sfn|Conklin|Basadur|VanPatter|2007b}}

== Strategies to tackle wicked problems ==
Wicked problems cannot be tackled by the traditional approach in which problems are defined, analysed and solved in sequential steps. The main reason for this is that there is no clear problem definition of wicked problems. In a paper published in 2000, Nancy Roberts identified the following strategies to cope with wicked problems:{{sfn|Roberts|2000}}

;Authoritative
:These strategies seek to tame wicked problems by vesting the responsibility for solving the problems in the hands of a few people. The reduction in the number of stakeholders reduces problem complexity, as many competing points of view are eliminated at the start. The disadvantage is that authorities and experts charged with solving the problem may not have an appreciation of all the perspectives needed to tackle the problem.
;Competitive
:These strategies attempt to solve wicked problems by pitting opposing points of view against each other, requiring parties that hold these views to come up with their preferred solutions. The advantage of this approach is that different solutions can be weighed up against each other and the best one chosen. The disadvantage is that this adversarial approach creates a confrontational environment in which knowledge sharing is discouraged. Consequently, the parties involved may not have an incentive to come up with their best possible solution.
;Collaborative
:These strategies aim to engage all stakeholders in order to find the best possible solution for all stakeholders. Typically these approaches involve meetings in which issues and ideas are discussed and a common, agreed approach is formulated.

In his 1972 paper,{{sfn|Rittel|1972}} Rittel hints at a collaborative approach; one which attempts "to make those people who are being affected into participants of the planning process. They are not merely asked but actively involved in the planning process". A disadvantage of this approach is that achieving a shared understanding and commitment to solving a wicked problem is a time-consuming process. Another difficulty is that, in some matters, at least one group of people may hold an absolute belief that necessarily contradicts other absolute beliefs held by other groups. Collaboration then becomes impossible until one set of beliefs is relativized or abandoned entirely. 

Research over the last two decades has shown the value of computer-assisted argumentation techniques in improving the effectiveness of cross-stakeholder communication.{{sfn|Shum|2003}} The technique of [[dialogue mapping]] has been used in tackling wicked problems in organizations using a collaborative approach.{{sfn|Conklin|2003}} More recently, in a four-year study of interorganizational collaboration across public, private, and voluntary sectors, steering by government was found to perversely undermine a successful collaboration, producing an organizational crisis which led to the collapse of a national initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Michael D|title=Organizational Turbulence, Trouble and Trauma: Theorizing the Collapse of a Mental Health Setting|journal=Organization Studies|date=28 September 2012|volume=33|issue=9|pages=1153–1173|doi=10.1177/0170840612448155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Michael Daniel|author2=Ferlie, Ewan |title=Resisting hybridisation between modes of clinical risk management: Contradiction, contest, and the production of intractable conflict|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|date=1 January 2013|volume=38|issue=1|pages=30–49|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2012.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Wholesome Design for Wicked Problems", Robert Knapp stated that there are ways forward in dealing with wicked problems: {{Quote|The first is to shift the goal of action on significant problems from "solution" to "intervention." Instead of seeking the answer that totally eliminates a problem, one should recognize that actions occur in an ongoing process, and further actions will always be needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knapp|first1=Robert|title=Wholesome Design for Wicked Problems|url=http://publicsphereproject.org/content/wholesome-design-wicked-problems|website=Public Sphere Project|accessdate=8 November 2015|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Examining networks designed to tackle wicked problems in health care, such as caring for older people or reducing [[sexually transmitted infections]], Ferlie and colleagues suggest that managed networks may be the "least bad" way of "making wicked problems governable".&lt;ref&gt;Ferlie, E., Fitzgerald, L., McGivern, G., Dopson, S. &amp; Bennett, C. (2013) 'Making Wicked Problems Governable?: The Case of Managed Networks in Health Care.' Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferlie, E., McGivern, G. &amp; Fitzgerald, L. (2012) 'A New Mode of Organising in Health Care? UK Cancer Services &amp; Governmentality'. Social Science &amp; Medicine, 74 (3) 340-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferlie, E., McGivern, G., Fitzgerald, L., Dopson, S. &amp; Bennett, C. (2011) 'Public Policy Networks &amp; 'Wicked Problems': A Nascent Solution?' Public Administration,  89 (2) 307–324.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Problem structuring methods ===
{{Main|Problem structuring methods}}
A range of approaches called ''problem structuring methods'' (PSMs) have been developed in [[operations research]] since the 1970s to address problems involving complexity, uncertainty and conflict. PSMs are usually used by a group of people in [[collaboration]] (rather than by a solitary individual) to create a [[consensus]] about, or at least to facilitate [[negotiation]]s about, what needs to change. Some widely adopted PSMs include [[soft systems methodology]], the strategic choice approach, and strategic options development and analysis (SODA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosenhead |first=Jonathan |date=2013 |chapter=Problem structuring methods |editor1-last=Gass |editor1-first=Saul I. |editor2-last=Fu |editor2-first=Michael C. |title=Encyclopedia of operations research and management science |edition=3rd |location=New York; London |publisher=[[Springer Verlag]] |pages=1162–1172 |isbn=978-1-4419-1137-7 |oclc=751832290 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-1153-7_806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related concepts ==

=== {{anchor|Social mess}}Messes and social messes ===
[[Russell Ackoff|Russell L. Ackoff]] wrote about complex problems as messes: "Every problem interacts with other problems and is therefore part of a set of interrelated problems, a system of problems.... I choose to call such a system a mess."{{sfn|Ackoff|1974}}

Extending Ackoff, [[Robert E. Horn|Robert Horn]] says that "a Social Mess is a set of interrelated problems and other messes.  Complexity—systems of systems—is among the factors that makes Social Messes so resistant to analysis and, more importantly, to resolution."

According to Horn, the defining characteristics of a social mess are:{{sfn|Horn|Weber|2007}}
# No unique "correct" view of the problem;
# Different views of the problem and contradictory solutions;
# Most problems are connected to other problems;
# Data are often uncertain or missing;
# Multiple value conflicts;
# [[Ideological]] and cultural constraints;
# Political constraints;
# Economic constraints;
# Often a-logical or illogical or multi-valued thinking;
# Numerous possible intervention points;
# Consequences difficult to imagine;
# Considerable uncertainty, ambiguity;
# Great resistance to change; and,
# Problem solver(s) out of contact with the problems and potential solutions.

=== Divergent and convergent problems ===
[[E. F. Schumacher]] distinguishes between ''divergent and convergent problems'' in his book ''[[A Guide for the Perplexed]]''. Convergent problems are those for which attempted solutions gradually converge on one solution or answer. Divergent problems are those for which different answers appear to increasingly contradict each other all the more they are elaborated, requiring a different approach involving faculties of a higher order like love and empathy.

=== Wicked problems in software development ===
In 1990 DeGrace and Stahl introduced the concept of wicked problems to [[software development]].{{sfn|DeGrace|Stahl|1990}} In the last decade, other [[computer scientist]]s{{sfn|Conklin|2003b}}{{sfn|Sølvberg|Kung|1993}} have pointed out that software development shares many properties with other [[design]] practices (particularly that people-, [[business process|process]]-, and [[technology]]-problems have to be considered equally), and have incorporated Rittel's concepts into their [[software design]] methodologies. The design and integration of complex software-defined services that use the Web ([[web services]]) can be construed as an evolution from previous models of software design, and therefore becomes a wicked problem also.

=== Super wicked problems ===
Kelly Levin, Benjamin Cashore, [[Graeme Auld]] and Steven Bernstein introduced the distinction between "wicked problems" and "super wicked problems" in a 2007 conference paper, which was followed by a 2012 journal article in ''Policy Sciences''. In their discussion of [[Global warming|global climate change]], they define super wicked problems as having the following additional characteristics:&lt;ref name="Levin 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levin|first=Kelly|author2=Cashore, Benjamin |author3=Bernstein, Steven |author4= Auld, Graeme |title=Overcoming the tragedy of super wicked problems: constraining our future selves to ameliorate global climate change|journal=Policy Sciences|date=23 May 2012|volume=45|issue=2|pages=123–152|doi=10.1007/s11077-012-9151-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Time is running out.
# No central authority.
# Those seeking to solve the problem are also causing it.
# Policies discount the future irrationally.

While the items that define a wicked problem relate to the problem itself, the items that define a super wicked problem relate to the agent trying to solve it. Global warming is a super wicked problem, and the need to intervene to tend to our longer term interests has also been taken up by others, including [[Richard Lazarus (law professor)|Richard Lazarus]].&lt;ref name="Lazarus 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lazarus|first=Richard|title=Super Wicked Problems and Climate Change: Restraining the Present to Liberate the Future|journal=Cornell Law Review|date=July 2009|volume=94|issue=5|pages=1153–1233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|Police}}
A '''policy''' is a [[Deliberation|deliberate]] [[system]] of [[principle]]s to guide decisions and achieve rational outcomes. A policy is a statement of intent, and is implemented as a procedure or protocol. Policies are generally adopted by a [[governance]] body within an organization. Policies can assist in both ''subjective'' and ''objective'' [[decision making]]. Policies to assist in subjective decision making usually assist senior management with decisions that must be based on the relative merits of a number of factors, and as a result are often hard to test objectively, e.g. [[work-life balance]] policy. In contrast policies to assist in objective decision making are usually operational in nature and can be objectively tested, e.g. password policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/legal/policy/what/index.shtml|title=What is policy|first=Publications|last=Office|date=|website=sydney.edu.au|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term may apply to government, private sector organizations and groups, as well as individuals. [[Executive order (United States)|Presidential executive orders]], [[privacy policy|corporate privacy policies]], and parliamentary [[rules of order]] are all examples of policy. Policy differs from [[rule of law|rules]] or [[law]]. While law can compel or prohibit behaviors (e.g. a law requiring the payment of taxes on income), policy merely guides actions toward those that are most likely to achieve a desired outcome.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Policy or [[policy study]] may also refer to the process of making important organizational decisions, including the identification of different alternatives such as programs or spending priorities, and choosing among them on the basis of the impact they will have. Policies can be understood as political, [[management|managerial]], financial, and administrative mechanisms arranged to reach explicit goals. In public corporate finance, a [[critical accounting policy]] is a policy for a firm/company or an industry that is considered to have a notably high subjective element, and that has a material impact on the [[financial statement]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Impact==

===Intended effects===
The intended effects of a policy vary widely according to the organization and the context in which they are made. Broadly, policies are typically instituted to avoid some negative effect that has been noticed in the 
organization, or to seek some positive benefit. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Corporate [[Purchasing process|purchasing policies]] provide an example of how organizations attempt to avoid negative  effects. Many large companies have policies that all purchases above a certain value must be performed through a purchasing process. By requiring this standard purchasing process through policy, the organization can limit waste and standardize the way purchasing is done. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The State of [[California]] provides an example of benefit-seeking policy. In recent years, the numbers of [[hybrid cars]] in California has increased dramatically, in part because of policy changes in [[Federal law]] that provided USD $1,500 in tax credits (since phased out) as well as the use of [[HOV|high-occupancy vehicle]] lanes to hybrid owners (no loew hybrid vehicles). In this case, the organization (state and/or federal government) created an effect (increased ownership and use of hybrid vehicles) through policy (tax breaks, highway lanes). {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Unintended effects===
Policies frequently have side effects or [[unintended consequences]].  Because the environments that policies seek to influence or manipulate are typically [[complex adaptive systems]] (e.g. governments, societies, large companies), making a policy change can have [[counterintuitive]] results.  For example, a government may make a policy decision to raise taxes, in hopes of increasing overall tax revenue.  Depending on the size of the tax increase, this may have the overall effect of reducing tax revenue by causing [[capital flight]] or by creating a rate so high that citizens are deterred from earning the money that is taxed. (See the [[Laffer curve]].) {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The policy formulation process theoretically includes an attempt to assess as many areas of potential policy impact as possible, to lessen the chances that a given policy will have unexpected or unintended consequences. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Policy cycle==
In [[political science]], the '''policy cycle''' is a tool used for the analyzing of the development of a policy item. It can also be referred to as a "stagist approach", "stages heuristic" or "stages approach". It is thus a rule of thumb rather than the actual reality of how policy is created, but has been influential in how [[political science|political scientists]] looked at policy in general.&lt;ref&gt;
Robert T. Nakamura, THE TEXTBOOK POLICY PROCESS AND IMPLEMENTATION RESEARCH:
Review of Policy Research Volume 7, Issue 1, pages 142–154, September 1987
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-1338.1987.tb00034.x/abstract&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed as a theory from [[Harold Lasswell]]'s work.

One version by James E. Anderson, in his ''Public Policy-Making'' (1974) has the following stages:
# [[Political agenda|Agenda]] setting (Problem identification) - The recognition of certain subject as a problem demanding further government attention. 
# Policy Formulation - Involves exploring a variation of options or alternative courses of action available for addressing the problem. (appraisal, dialogue, formulation, and consolidation)
# Decision-making - Government decides on an ultimate course of action, whether to perpetuate the policy status quo or alter it. (Decision could be 'positive', 'negative', or 'no-action') 
# [[Implementation]] - The ultimate decision made earlier will be put into practice.
# [[Evaluation]] - Assesses the effectiveness of a public policy in terms of its perceived intentions and results. [[Actor (policy debate)|Policy actors]] attempt to determine whether the course of action is a success or failure by examining its impact and outcomes.

An eight step policy cycle is developed in detail in ''The Australian Policy Handbook'' by Peter Bridgman and [[Glyn Davis]]: (now with Catherine Althaus in its 4th and 5th editions)

# Issue identification
# [[Policy analysis]]
# [[Public consultation|Consultation]] (which permeates the entire process)
# Policy instrument development
# Building coordination and coalitions
# Program Design: [[Decision theory|Decision]] making
# Policy [[Implementation]]
# Policy [[Evaluation]]

The Althaus, Bridgman &amp; Davis model is [[heuristic]] and [[iterative]]. It is {{clarify|text=intentionally [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]]|date=February 2016}} and not meant to be {{clarify|text=[[Organizational diagnostics|diagnostic]]|date=February 2016}} or [[predictive]]. Policy cycles are typically characterized as adopting a classical approach, and tend to describe processes from the perspective of policy decision makers. Accordingly, some [[Postpositivism|postpositivist]] academics challenge cyclical models as unresponsive and unrealistic, preferring systemic and more complex models.&lt;ref&gt;Young, John and Enrique Mendizabal. [https://www.odi.org/publications/1127-become-policy-entrepreneur-roma Helping researchers become policy entrepreneurs], [[Overseas Development Institute]], London, September 2009. &lt;!--accessed 07 October 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They consider a broader range of actors involved in the policy space that includes [[Voluntary sector|civil society organisations]], the [[Mass media|media]], [[intellectuals]], [[think tanks]] or policy [[research institutes]], corporations, [[Advocacy group|lobbyists]], etc.

==Content==
Policies are typically [[promulgation|promulgated]] through official written documents. Policy documents often come with the endorsement or signature of the executive powers within an organization to legitimize the policy and demonstrate that it is considered in force. Such documents often have standard formats that are particular to the organization issuing the policy.  While such formats differ in form, policy documents usually contain certain standard components including '''{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}''' :
* A '''purpose statement''', outlining why the organization is issuing the policy, and what its desired effect or outcome of the policy should be.
* An '''applicability and scope''' statement, describing who the policy affects and which actions are impacted by the policy. The applicability and scope may expressly exclude certain people, organizations, or actions from the policy requirements.  Applicability and scope is used to focus the policy on only the desired targets, and avoid unintended consequences where possible.
* An '''effective date''' which indicates when the policy comes into force.  [[Ex post facto law|Retroactive policies]] are rare, but can be found.
* A '''responsibilities''' section, indicating which parties and organizations are responsible for carrying out individual policy statements.  Many policies may require the establishment of some ongoing function or action.  For example, a purchasing policy might specify that a purchasing office be created to process purchase requests, and that this office would be responsible for ongoing actions.  Responsibilities often include identification of any relevant [[Regulation|oversight]] and/or [[governance]] structures.
* '''Policy statements''' indicating the specific regulations, requirements, or modifications to organizational behavior that the policy is creating.  Policy statements are extremely diverse depending on the organization and intent, and may take almost any form.

Some policies may contain additional sections, including:
* '''Background''', indicating any reasons, history, ethical background statements, and/or intent that led to the creation of the policy, which may be listed as '''motivating factors'''.  This information is often quite valuable when policies must be evaluated or used in ambiguous situations, just as the intent of a law can be useful to a court when deciding a case that involves that law.
* '''Definitions''', providing clear and unambiguous definitions for terms and concepts found in the policy document.

==Typologies==
The American political scientist [[Theodore J. Lowi]] proposed four types of policy, namely '''distributive''', '''redistributive''', '''regulatory''' and '''constituent''' in his article 'Four systems of Policy, Politics and Choice' and in 'American Business, Public Policy, Case Studies and Political Theory'.
Policy addresses the [[intent]] of the organization, whether government, business, professional, or voluntary. Policy is intended to affect the 'real' world, by guiding the decisions that are made. Whether they are formally written or not, most organizations have identified policies.&lt;ref&gt;https://perguntasaopo.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/lowi_1972_four-systems-of-policy-politics-and-choice.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Policies may be classified in many different ways. The following is a sample of several different types of policies broken down by their effect on members of the organization.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

===Distributive policies===
[[Distributive tendency|Distributive policies]] extend goods and services to members of an organization, as well as distributing the costs of the goods/services amongst the members of the organization. Examples include government policies that impact spending for [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]], [[public education]], [[highways]], and public safety, or a professional organization's benefits plan.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

===Regulatory policies===
Regulatory policies, or mandates, limit the discretion of individuals and agencies, or otherwise compel certain types of behavior. These policies are generally thought to be best applied when good behavior can be easily defined and bad behavior can be easily regulated and punished through fines or sanctions. An example of a fairly successful public regulatory policy is that of a highway speed limit.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

===Constituent policies===
Constituent policies create executive power entities, or deal with laws. Constituent policies also deal with Fiscal Policy in some circumstances.{{Citation needed|reason=As well as the governing board creates laws
Noman Dhakkn|date=February 2010}}

===Redistributive policies===
Policies are dynamic; they are not just static lists of goals or laws. Policy blueprints have to be implemented, often with unexpected results. Social policies are what happens 'on the ground' when they are implemented, as well as what happens at the decision making or legislative stage.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

When the term policy is used, it may also refer to:{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}
* Official government policy (legislation or guidelines that govern how laws should be put into operation)
* Broad ideas and goals in political manifestos and pamphlets
* A company or organization's policy on a particular topic.  For example, the equal opportunity policy of a company shows that the company aims to treat all its staff equally.

The actions the organization actually takes may often vary significantly from stated policy. This difference is sometimes caused by [[Horse trading|political compromise]] over policy, while in other situations it is caused by lack of policy implementation and enforcement. Implementing policy may have unexpected results, stemming from a policy whose reach extends further than the problem it was originally crafted to address. Additionally, unpredictable results may arise from selective or idiosyncratic enforcement of policy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Types of [[policy analysis]] include: &lt;!-- explain them!--&gt;

* Causal (resp. non-causal)
* Deterministic (resp. stochastic, randomized and sometimes non-deterministic)
* Index
* Memoryless (''e.g.'', non-stationary)
* Opportunistic (resp. non-opportunistic)
* Stationary (resp. non-stationary)

These qualifiers can be combined, so one could, for example, have a stationary-memoryless-index policy.

==Specific policy types==

==Other uses of the term==
* In [[enterprise architecture]] for systems design, [[policy appliances]] are technical control and logging mechanisms to enforce or reconcile policy (systems use) rules and to ensure accountability in [[information systems]].
* In [[insurance]], policies are contracts between insurer and insured used to [[Indemnity|indemnify]] (protect) against potential loss from specified perils. While these documents are referred to as policies, they are in actuality a form of [[contract]] - see [[insurance contract]].
* In [[gambling]], policy is a form of an unsanctioned lottery, where players purport to purchase ''[[insurance]]'' against a chosen number being picked by a legitimate [[lottery]]. Or can refer to an ordinary [[Numbers game]]
* In [[artificial intelligence]] planning &lt;!-- as in artificial intelligence? unclear--&gt; and ''reinforcement learning'', a policy prescribes a non-empty deliberation (sequence of actions) given a non-empty sequence of states.
* In [[debate (parliamentary procedure)|debate]], the term "policy" is slang for [[policy debate|policy or cross-examination]] debate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3231">'''Media policy''' / '''M. politics''' is a term describing all [[legislation]] and political action directed towards [[Media regulation|regulating]] the [[media (communication)|media]], especially [[mass media]], and the [[media industry]]. Those actions will usually be prompted by pressures from [[public opinion]] or from industry [[interest group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.le.ac.uk/oerresources/media/ms7501/mod2unit11/page_10.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Print media]], [[public radio]] and television [[public broadcasting|broadcasting]], [[mobile communication|mobile]] [[telecommunication|communications]] all converge in the [[digital infrastructure]]. This [[digitalisation]] produces markets that still lack consistent and rigorous [[market regulation|regulation]]. In instances where regulations exist, technical innovations outpace and overtake existing rules and give rise to illegal activities like [[copyright violation]]s. This has to be dealt with to defend [[intellectual property rights]] (see e.g. [[Digital Economy Act 2010]])

Media politics is the subject of studies in [[media research]] and [[cultural studies]].

Liberal media policy is adversely affected by the fact that political success itself hinges critically on favorable comments in the media, see [[politico-media complex]].

'''Reshaping Cultural Policies''' (styled as  '''Re|Shaping Cultural Policies''') is a report series published by [[UNESCO]] which monitors the implementation of the [[Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions|UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]] (2005).&lt;ref name=mnialive2017&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mnialive.com/articles/launch-of-global-culture-report-at-meeting-of-unesco-s-convention-on-the-diversity-of-cultural-expre|title=Launch of Global Culture Report at Meeting of UNESCO’s Convention on the Diversity of Cultural Expressions|date=8 December 2017|accessdate=31 October 2018|publisher=MNIAlive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2005 [[UNESCO]] Convention encourages its 146 parties to introduce [[Policy|policies]] for [[culture]] within a global context and commitment to protect and promote the diversity of cultural expressions. The second and most recent report (2018) subtitled “Advancing Creativity for Development” follows the first report (2015) with the subtitle “A Decade Promoting the Diversity of Cultural Expressions for Development”.&lt;ref name="Lovrinić2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lovrinić|first1=Barbara|date=2018|title=UNESCO Global Report Reshaping Cultural Policies.

Primarily, the report series draws on reports of all parties to the Convention submitted every four years in which they present and describe the actions they have taken in order to implement the Convention. These reports are called quadrennial periodic reports (QPRs). In addition, the report series includes the analysis of other both governmental and non-governmental sources. In general, the report investigates how implementing the convention reshapes cultural policies.&lt;ref name="gmr"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Monitoring Report.

The report puts forward a set of policy recommendations for the future, addressing the adaptation of cultural policies to rapid change in the digital environment, based on human rights and fundamental freedoms of expression. &lt;ref name="mnialive2017" /&gt; &lt;ref name="GR2018" /&gt;

“Each Report is not an end-result, but a tool to be used in a long-term process that includes the forging of spaces for policy dialogue, reinforcing stakeholders’ capacities to work together to generate data and information, and advocate for policy innovation both nationally and globally.” &lt;ref name="GR2018" /&gt;{{rp|28}}

The reports are published in [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] and [[German language|German]]. UNESCO is the lead institutional author of the Global Report series and coordinates a broader network of independent experts who author chapters. &lt;ref name="GR2015" /&gt;

In line with the Parties’ quadrennial periodic reporting, the series is produced every four years. The first cycle spanned the years 2012-2015 and the second runs from 2016 to 2019. Accordingly, the third publication will take place in December 2021.&lt;ref name="GR2018" /&gt;

== Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions (2005) ==
{{Main|Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions}}

The 2005 Convention is an international standard setting instrument providing a framework for the [[Cultural governance|governance of culture]]. In this context, governance of culture refers to policies and measures governments establish to regulate, to promote and to protect all forms of [[creativity]] and artistic expressions. The most recent UNESCO Convention in the field of culture and ratified by 146 parties, it is the first international legal tool to encourage governments to invest in creativity. It frames the formulation and implementation of different types of legislative, regulatory, institutional and financial interventions to promote the emergence of dynamic cultural and [[Creative industries|creative industry]] sectors around the world.&lt;ref name="Creativity"&gt;{{cite book |last1=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) |title=Investing in Creativity |date=2018 |publisher=UNESCO |location=Paris |url=https://en.unesco.org/creativity/sites/creativity/files/info-kit_brochure-final-en-web.pdf |accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the context of the 2005 Convention, the diversity of cultural expressions ''″''refers to the manifold ways in which the cultures of groups and societies find expression. These expressions are passed on within and among groups and societies''″''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) |title=The 2005 Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions |date=2005 |publisher=UNESCO |location=Paris |url=https://en.unesco.org/creativity/convention/texts |accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lovrinić2018 /&gt; Specifically, the Convention understands cultural expressions as all forms of creativity and artistic expressions, such as in [[Filmmaking|cinema]]/[[Audiovisual art|audiovisual arts]], [[design]], [[digital arts]], [[music]], [[performing arts]], [[publishing]] and the [[visual arts]]. The 2005 Convention was "since its beginnings, permeated by a material and economic perspective of cultural expressions, focused on the production and consumption of cultural goods and services, with a view to promote more balanced exchanges and sustainable development that takes into account cultural diversity concerns." &lt;ref name="Hanania2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richieri Hanania|first1=Lilian|date=2016|title=The UNESCO Convention on the Diversity of Cultural Expressions as a coordination framework to promote regulatory coherence in the creative economy, International Journal of Cultural Policy.|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10286632.2015.1025068|journal=International Journal of Cultural Policy|volume=22|issue=4|pages=574-593|accessdate=26 November 2018|via=Routledge|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The implementation of the 2005 Convention aims to contribute to achieving several [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs), precisely SDG 4 (Quality [[Education]]), SDG 5 ([[Gender equality|Gender Equality]]), SDG 8 (Decent Work and [[Economic growth|Economic Growth]]), SDG 10 (Reduced [[Economic inequality|Inequalities]]), SDG 16 ([[Peace]], [[Justice]] and Strong Institutions) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). The implementation process identifies investing in creativity as a priority for [[sustainable development]]. &lt;ref name=GR2018 /&gt; At the global level, the convention calls for countries to provide financial assistance for creativity through their [[Official development assistance|Official Development Assistance (ODA)]] by investing in the Convention’s [[International Fund for Cultural Diversity]]. Additionally, UNESCO, through the 2005 Convention, offers [[technical assistance]] to strengthen human and institutional capacities in [[Developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref name=Creativity /&gt;

== Content ==
The director general of UNESCO, [[Audrey Azoulay]] referring to the UNESCO General Conference's conviction that cultural activities, goods and services have both an economic and a cultural nature stated:&lt;ref name="Hanania2016" /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;″[c]ulture is not a commodity: it carries values and identities, it gives markers to live together in a globalized world. Our role is to encourage, question, collect data, to understand and energize creative channels, to encourage the mobility of artists, to stimulate a rapidly changing sector in the new digital environment″. &lt;ref name="Launch"&gt; [[Audrey Azoulay]], Director General of UNESCO.  In {{cite web |title=UNESCO Director-General Launches Global Report Re-shaping Cultural Policies |url=http://www.publicnow.com/view/F21BAD0B4EA808C605D8DDB0AF5C2BBB628BAB27 |website=Public |accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Annika Markovic, Ambassador and Permanent Delegate of Sweden to UNESCO, in 2018, claimed that the report is ''“the only global document that presents an overview of cultural development world-wide and monitors state action to protect and promote the diversity of cultural expressions at all levels.”'' &lt;ref name="publicnow"&gt;{{cite news |title=UNESCO Director-General Launches Global Report Re-shaping Cultural Policies |url=http://www.publicnow.com/view/F21BAD0B4EA808C605D8DDB0AF5C2BBB628BAB27 |accessdate=2 November 2018 |publisher=Public |date=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The following aspects thematically summarize the core findings identified by the 2018 report with regard to the implementation of the 2005 UNESCO Convention.

=== Culture &amp; sustainable development ===
For the first time, national development plans and strategies integrate culture, mainly of countries in the [[Global South]]. As a result, cities seem to invest more and more in cultural industries for development. The UN’s 2030 Agenda recognized the role of creativity in sustainable development in the implementation of the SDGs. However, the share of development aid spent on culture today is the lowest it has been in over 10 years. &lt;ref name=GR2018 /&gt;

=== Cultural expressions in the digital age ===
According to the report, digital revenues make up 50% of the recorded music market, growing almost 18% over the past year due to a sharp increase in the share of streaming revenues. &lt;ref name=GR2018 /&gt;

The report states that the internet transforms the cultural value chain into a network platform. E-commerce challenges both culture and trade policies that intend to promote the diversity of cultural expressions. &lt;ref name=GR2018 /&gt;{{rp|28}} It articulates the urgency to improve data collection on revenues generated through digital channels in order to design better policies and negotiate fair trade agreements. The report claims that monitoring the relationship between large platforms, [[Big data|Big Data]], [[artificial intelligence]] and the diversity of cultural expressions is crucial to ensure that a variety of distribution platforms and providers promote and protect future artistic creations. &lt;ref name="GR2018" /&gt;

=== Artistic freedom ===
As informed by the report, attacks against artists have increased in the past years, including in the digital environment where surveillance and online trolling pose new threats to artistic freedom. In 2016, 430 cases were reported around the world (compared to 340 in 2015 and 90 in 2014).&lt;ref name=moderndiplomacy2017&gt;{{cite news|url=https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2017/12/08/launch-of-global-culture-report-at-meeting-of-unesco-s-convention-on-the-diversity-of-cultural-expressions/|title=Launch of Global Culture Report at Meeting of UNESCO’s Convention on the Diversity of Cultural Expressions|date=8 December 2017|accessdate=31 October 2018|publisher=Modern Diplomacy}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=epd&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.epd.de/landesdienst/landesdienst-ost/schwerpunktartikel/unesco-fordert-st%C3%A4rkung-der-kulturwirtschaft|title=Unesco fordert Stärkung der Kulturwirtschaft. Deutsche Kulturverbände für regelmäßigen Regierungsbericht|date=8 December 2017|accessdate=31 October 2018|publisher=Evangelischer Pressedienst}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musicians are the most threatened group, while authors also often become a target.&lt;ref name=GR2018 /&gt;&lt;ref name=mculturalsector &gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ifa.de/de/nachrichten-presse/detail/news/where-the-cultural-sector-stands.html|title=Where the Cultural Sector stands.|accessdate=31 October 2018|publisher=Institut für Auslandsbeziehungen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=epd /&gt;  In 2016, attacks against authors occurred most often in the [[Asia-Pacific|Asia-Pacific Region]] (80 cases), the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]] (51 cases) and [[Europe]] (47 cases). &lt;ref name=epd /&gt; The report reveals that meanwhile, there exists an increased awareness with regard to such threats leading to a larger number of initiatives to support the social and economic rights of artists, particularly in African countries. While there exists legal action to affirm the freedom of expression for artists, other laws addressing terrorism and state security repress artistic expressions. &lt;ref name=GR2018 /&gt;

=== Gender equality in cultural and creative industries ===
[[File:Proportion of female artists in ten recent global biennales, 2017.png|thumb|556x556px|Proportion of female artists in ten recent global biennales, 2017]]
The report states that half of the persons working in the cultural and creative industries are female. However, a gender gap persists worldwide concerning equal pay, access to funding and prices charged for creative works. Consequently, women remain under-represented in key creative roles and are outnumbered in decision-making positions.&lt;ref name=GR2018 /&gt;&lt;ref name=publicnow /&gt; &lt;ref name=epd /&gt; Women make up only 34% of [[Culture minister|Ministers for Culture]] (compared to 24% in 2005) and only 31% of national arts program directors. Generally, women are represented in specific cultural fields such as arts education and training (60%), book publishing and press (54%), audiovisual and interactive media (26%), as well as design and creative services (33%).&lt;ref name="moderndiplomacy2017" /&gt;

=== Mobility of artists and cultural professionals ===
[[File:Average number of countries accessible without visas passport-holders Global North and Global South, 2017.png|thumb|Average number of countries accessible without visas passport-holders Global North and Global South, 2017]]
The report demonstrates that predominantly restrictions in terms of mobility represent great challenges to persons pursuing careers in the cultural and creative industries, specifically to those from the Global South.&lt;ref name="newspress2017"&gt;{{cite news |title=L’UNESCO soutient la mobilité des artistes en Tunesie |url=http://www.newspress.fr/Communique_FR_306040_1052.aspx |accessdate=2 November 2018 |publisher=News Press |date=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It reveals that a holder of a German passport can travel to 176 countries without a visa while a holder of an Afghan passport can only travel to 24 countries without a [[Travel visa|visa]].&lt;ref name="newspress2017" /&gt; As a matter of fact, artists and cultural professionals need to travel to perform, to reach new audiences or to attend a [[Artist-in-residence|residency]] or to engage in networking. The report exposes that travel restrictions, including difficulties in obtaining visas oftentimes impedes artists from the [[Global South]] to participate in art [[Biennale|biennales]] or [[Film festival|film festivals]], even when invited to receive an award or to promote their works. &lt;ref name="GR2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="epd" /&gt;

=== Governance of culture ===
As stated in the report, the 2005 Convention provides legitimacy for the formulation of cultural policies and their adaptation to changing circumstances and needs. The report underscores that collaborative governance and multi-stakeholder policy making have progressed, notably in some developing countries particularly in the creative economy and cultural education. As a result, parties to the Convention have made considerable progress in fostering digital arts creation, supporting creative entrepreneurship, accelerating the modernization of cultural sectors, promoting distribution and updating [[copyright]] legislation.&lt;ref name=GR2018 /&gt; However, the report also reveals a lack in civil society participation in policy making. It underlines the urgency for more effort to ensure the creation of open, transparent and participatory policy processes in order to involve civil society participation in policy making. &lt;ref name=GR2018 /&gt; &lt;ref name=publicnow /&gt;

=== Trade and investment in cultural goods and services ===
In accordance with the report, the 2005 Convention formally recognizes that cultural goods and services not only have important economic value, but also convey identities, meanings and values.&lt;ref name=GR2018 /&gt; As a consequence, at least eight bilateral and regional free trade agreements concluded between 2015 and 2017 have introduced cultural clauses or list of commitments that promote the objectives and principles of the 2005 Convention. Despite the lack of the promotion of the objectives and principles of the 2005 Convention with regard to the negotiation of mega-regional partnership agreements, some Parties to the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership|Trans Pacific Partnership (TTP)]] have succeeded in introducing important cultural reservations to protect and promote the diversity of cultural expressions. &lt;ref name=GR2018 /&gt;

== Next steps ==
The report’s primary objective is “to provide key actors with better knowledge on how to support evidence-based policy, and to strengthen informed, transparent and participatory systems of governance for culture.” &lt;ref name=gmr /&gt; It aims to motivate governments and civil society actors to integrate findings and recommendations into their national cultural policy and development strategies and frameworks.&lt;ref name=GR2018 /&gt; 

Following the findings presented above, the implementation of the 2005 Convention "introduce[s] a range of different policy strategies for integrating culture into development processes" &lt;ref name="Throsby 2017"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Throsby|first=David|date=February 2017|title=Culturally sustainable development: theoretical concept or practical policy instrument?|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10286632.2017.1280788|journal=International Journal of Cultural Policy|volume=23|pages=133-147|accessdate=30 October 2018|via=Taylor &amp; Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; and culture is increasingly regarded as "an economic asset in pursuing sustainable development"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiktor-Mach|first=Dobrosława|date=October 2018|title=What role for culture in the age of sustainable development? UNESCO’s advocacy in the 2030 Agenda negotiations|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10286632.2018.1534841|journal=International Journal of Cultural Policy|volume=|pages=|via=Taylor &amp; Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Based on its analysis and findings, the Global Report of 2018 suggests the following road map for the parties to the 2005 Convention.&lt;ref name="GR2018" /&gt; Accordingly, parties could tackle major challenges in the implementation of the 2005 Convention by:

# Streamlining and harmonizing data and information required for national and global monitoring purposes;
# Encouraging research networks and statistical offices around the world to use the Global Report monitoring framework, its core indicators and means of verification as a basis for their data collection and the establishing of statistical baselines;
# Filling existing data gaps identified in the two Global reports referring to key cultural policy areas, such as trade in cultural services, mobility flows, culture in the digital environment, or gender-disaggregated data;
# Raising awareness among policy decision makers for cultural policy reforms;
# Building capacities on policy monitoring;
# Sensitizing the development community with regard to the creative sector's potential not only contribute to the creation of jobs and income, but also have the to catalyze innovation, permeating traditional development areas such as education and gender equality, and bring about change.

== Challenges  ==
Speaking about the visibility of the progress in cultural policies shown by the report series, Bárbara Lovrinić stated that ''“[u]nfortunately, where UNESCO is concerned, there is a lack of promotion in the media in general. In the long term, the report could have a positive impact on these issues, which would be enhanced if the public were made more aware of such work.”''&lt;ref name="Lovrinić2018" /&gt;{{rp|137}} She also points out that there is ''"a risk that many people will not dwell on the 2005 Convention and the Sustainable Development Goals unless they are already somewhat familiar with the topic.”''&lt;ref name="Lovrinić2018" /&gt;{{rp|137}} With reference to the title of the report series, she concludes that ''"cultural policy-making is still far from being reshaped, for it takes a serious amount of time to yield valuable results.”''&lt;ref name="Lovrinić2018" /&gt;{{rp|139}}

'''Educational technology''' is the use of [[technology]] in [[education]] to improve [[learning]] and [[teaching]]. Educational technology is related to '''instructional technology''' and '''learning technology''', but different groups prefer different terms and each has its own historical significance.

The words ''educational'' and ''technology'' in the term ''educational technology'' have the general meaning. Educational technology is not restricted to the education of children, nor to the use of [[high tech]]nology. The particular case of the meaningful use of high-technology to enhance learning in [[K-12]] classrooms and higher education is known as [[Technology Integration|technology integration]].

'''[[Education]]''' – in the general sense is any act or [[experience]] that has a formative effect on the [[mind]], [[Moral character|character]], or physical ability of an individual. In its technical sense, education is the process by which society deliberately transmits its accumulated [[knowledge]], [[skill]]s, and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] from one generation to another. Education can also be defined as the process of becoming an educated person.&lt;ref&gt;Don, Berg. "Definition of Education." teach-kids-attitude-1st.com. N.p., n.d.

* Traditions in education
** [[Idealism]] – This tradition emerged in Greece and the famous philosophers who introduced this concept were Socrates and his pupil Plato. The basic concept launched was that all the things we see in this world are actually the copy not original.  What ever we produce here becomes an idea in our mind. So whatever we work to create something is first takes shape in ideas and minds, so the true reality is Idealism.They both supported an education which provides the opportunity to develop mental faculties and make student think properly to find any reality.
** [[Philosophical realism|Realism]] – Aristotle, the pupil of Plato was the person who got the concept of Realism and argued that the Idealism is not the only reality, but there are many natural things which are the part of our atmosphere and we come across those things. Whatever we observe is very important to work on and find the realities using empirical evidences. So the education that is based on experience and observable realities will guide the students to find out the reality. The same has relevance to the philosophy of Positivism.
** [[Educational perennialism|Perennialism]] – This concept was introduced by Robert Hutchins who was of a view that the education should have ever-lasting impact on the students and therefore the only ever-last ideas should be taught. for that he supported the religious concepts to be incorporated in the curriculum.
** [[Existentialism]] – Kierkegaard argued that all the philosophers are of a view to inculcate into the students which is something outdoor with reference to the students. He told that realities are subjective and they are with the individuals themselves. The education should work on individuals to harness the inner realities.
** [[Theism]] – Thomas Aquinas introduced the church doctrine in education and emphasized that reason and faith are complimentary so the both ideas should be the base of education and the students should go by the reasons introduced by the faith, church or religion.
** [[Essentialism]] – The education philosophies were taking many turns in the twentieth century when William Bagley raised his voice to attract the attention of the theoreticians telling that the education should have a core basics of the culture and heritage. The students should be given choice of study the said core subject and they should go to the 1930s education where the same was used to teach.
** [[Pragmatism]] – John Dewey was the person who told that in education a democratic view is to be implemented. Students should be given a chance to explore themselves and they should go by their own instinctive drives.
** [[Critical thinking]] – There was a team of German theoreticians like Adorno, Horkheimer and Habermas who gave the concept of Critical Theory and argued that the education which provides the students and prepare them to analyze the things under discussion, is the basic requirement of education.
** [[Social education]] – In his book, Social Education, Applied Perspective, Muhammad Zahid Azeem Zahid has argued that the education which provides the opportunity to the students to find their space in society and the education should be in line with the societal need not only individually but holistically as well. The Social Education Model is to be implemented in the third world countries as there is a big need to join the individual and society. An educated person can become a good professional and can lead a good life individually, but the need of the day is that he or she should keep his profession and the lifestyle favorable to the society as well....

=== Schools ===

* [[School]] – an institution designed for the teaching of students (or "pupils") under the direction of teachers. Most countries have systems of formal education (commonly compulsory), in which students progress through a series of schools. The names for these schools vary by country but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education. Non-compulsory higher education follows, and is taught in institutions called a college or university.

'''Education''' is the process of facilitating [[learning]], or the acquisition of [[knowledge]], [[skill]]s, [[values]], [[belief]]s, and [[habit (psychology)|habits.]] Educational methods include [[storytelling]], [[discussion]], [[teaching]], [[training]], and directed [[research]]. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators and also learners may also [[autodidacticism|educate themselves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The methodology of teaching is called [[pedagogy]].

Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as [[preschool]] or [[kindergarten]], [[primary school]], [[secondary school]] and then [[college]], [[university]], or [[apprenticeship]].

A [[right to education]] has been recognized by some governments and the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="ICESCR-art13.1"&gt;Article 13 of the [[United Nations]]' 1966 [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] recognizes a universal right to education. ''ICESCR'', Article 13.1&lt;/ref&gt; In most regions, education is [[compulsory education|compulsory]] up to a certain age.

==Etymology==
[[Etymologically]], the word "education" is derived from the Latin word ''[[wikt:en:educatio#Latin|ēducātiō]]'' ("A breeding, a bringing up, a rearing") from ''[[wikt:en:educo#Latin|ēducō]]'' ("I educate, I train") which is related to the [[homonym]] ''[[wikt:en:educo#Latin|ēdūcō]]'' ("I lead forth, I take out; I raise up, I erect") from ''[[wikt:en:e-#Latin|ē-]]'' ("from, out of") and ''[[wikt:en:duco#Latin|dūcō]]'' ("I lead, I conduct").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=educate educate].

Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-[[Literacy|literate]] societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their [[knowledge]] beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Mind of Egypt: History and Meaning in the Time of the Pharaohs | author=Assmann, Jan | year=2002 | page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Ricci Guangqi 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Matteo Ricci]] (left) and [[Xu Guangqi]] (right) in the Chinese edition of ''[[Euclid's Elements]]'' published in 1607]]

[[Plato]] founded the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] in [[Ancient Athens|Athens]], the first institution of higher learning in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="Br"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Plato|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Alexandria]] in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of [[Ancient Greece]]. There, the great [[Library of Alexandria]] was built in the 3rd century BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; ''A Very Short History of the World''; Penguin Books, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[China]], [[Confucius]] (551–479 BCE), of the [[State of Lu]], was the country's most influential ancient philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of China and neighbours like Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Confucius gathered disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt his ideals for good governance, but his [[Analects]] were written down by followers and have continued to influence education in East Asia into the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/03/150325-confucius-china-asia-philosophy-communist-party-ngbooktalk/|title=Why Is Confucius Still Relevant Today?

The [[Aztecs]] also had a well-developed theory about education, which has an equivalent word in [[Nahuatl]] called ''tlacahuapahualiztli.'' It means "the art of raising or educating a person"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indigenous Education through Dance and Ceremony: A Mexica Palimpsest|last=Colin|first=Ernesto|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2014|isbn=978-1-349-47094-5|location=New York|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "the art of strengthening or bringing up men."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aztec Thought and Culture: A Study of the Ancient Nahuatl Mind|last=León-Portilla|first=Miguel|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-8061-0569-7|location=Norman|pages=134–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a broad conceptualization of education, which prescribed that it begins at home, supported by formal schooling, and reinforced by community living. Historians cite that formal education was mandatory for everyone regardless of social class and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Non-Western Educational Traditions: Alternative Approaches to Educational Thought and Practice|last=Reagan|first=Timothy|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers|year=2005|isbn=978-0-8058-4857-1|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also the word ''neixtlamachiliztli'', which is "the act of giving wisdom to the face."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These concepts underscore a complex set of educational practices, which was oriented towards communicating to the next generation the experience and intellectual heritage of the past for the purpose of individual development and his integration into the community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After the [[Fall of Rome]], the [[Catholic Church]] became the sole preserver of literate scholarship in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.nature.com/soapboxscience/2011/05/18/science-owes-much-to-both-christianity-and-the-middle-ages|title=Science owes much to both Christianity and the Middle Ages : Soapbox Science|website=blogs.nature.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church established [[cathedral schools]] in the Early Middle Ages as centres of advanced education. Some of these establishments ultimately evolved into [[medieval universities]] and forebears of many of Europe's modern universities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; During the High Middle Ages, [[Chartres Cathedral]] operated the famous and influential [[School of Chartres|Chartres Cathedral School]]. The medieval universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of inquiry, and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including [[Thomas Aquinas]] of the [[University of Naples]], [[Robert Grosseteste]] of the [[University of Oxford]], an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07037a.htm |work=Catholic Encyclopedia|title=Robert Grosseteste |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 June 1910 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Saint [[Albertus Magnus|Albert the Great]], a pioneer of biological field research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01264a.htm |work=Catholic Encyclopedia|title=St. Albertus Magnus |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 March 1907 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1088, the [[University of Bologne]] is considered the first, and the oldest continually operating university.&lt;ref&gt;Nuria Sanz, Sjur Bergan: "The heritage of European universities", 2nd edition, Higher Education Series No. 7, Council of Europe, 2006, ISBN, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere during the Middle Ages, [[Islamic science]] and [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematics]] flourished under the Islamic [[caliphate]] which was established across the Middle East, extending from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the west to the [[Indus]] in the east and to the [[Almoravid Dynasty]] and [[Mali Empire]] in the south.

[[The Renaissance]] in Europe ushered in a [[Scientific revolution|new age of scientific and intellectual inquiry]] and appreciation of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. Around 1450, [[Johannes Gutenberg]] developed a printing press, which allowed works of literature to spread more quickly. The European Age of Empires saw European ideas of education in philosophy, religion, arts and sciences spread out across the globe. Missionaries and scholars also brought back new ideas from other civilizations&amp;nbsp;– as with the [[Jesuit China missions]] who played a significant role in the transmission of knowledge, science, and culture between China and Europe, translating works from Europe like [[Euclid's Elements]] for Chinese scholars and the thoughts of [[Confucius]] for European audiences. [[The Enlightenment]] saw the emergence of a more secular educational outlook in Europe.

In most countries today, full-time education, whether at school or [[homeschooling|otherwise]], is compulsory for all children up to a certain age. Due to this the proliferation of compulsory education, combined with population growth, [[UNESCO]] has calculated that in the next 30&amp;nbsp;years more people will receive formal education than in all of human history thus far.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, K.: [http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html ''Schools Kill Creativity''].

==Formal education==
Formal education occurs in a [[learning environment|structured environment]] whose explicit purpose is teaching [[student]]s. Usually, formal education takes place in a [[school]] environment with [[classroom]]s of multiple students learning together with a trained, certified teacher of the subject. Most [[Educational management|school systems]] are designed around a set of values or ideals that govern all educational choices in that system. Such choices include curriculum, [[school organizational models|organizational models]], design of the physical [[learning space]]s (e.g. classrooms), student-teacher interactions, methods of assessment, class size, educational activities, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://enhancinged.wgbh.org/started/what/formal.html|title = Enhancing Education|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.competencecentre.eu/index.php/home/74-what-is-the-difference-between-qinformalq-and-qnon-formalq-learning|title =Perspectives Competence Centre, Lifeling Learning Programme|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20141015103040/http://www.competencecentre.eu/index.php/home/74-what-is-the-difference-between-qinformalq-and-qnon-formalq-learning|archivedate =15 October 2014|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preschool===
[[File:Parent's day at Eirfan's Kindergarten.jpg|thumb|Young children in a [[kindergarten]] in Japan]]
{{Main|Early childhood education}}
Preschools provide education from ages approximately three to seven, depending on the country when children enter [[primary education]]. These are also known as [[nursery schools]] and as [[kindergarten]], except in the US, where kindergarten is a term often used to describe the earliest levels of primary education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecs.org/kindergarten-policies/|title=50-State Comparison: State Kindergarten-Through-Third-Grade Policies|website=www.ecs.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kindergarten "provide[s] a child-centred, preschool curriculum for three- to seven-year-old children that aim[s] at unfolding the child's physical, intellectual, and moral nature with balanced emphasis on each of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ross|first=Elizabeth Dale|title=The Kindergarten Crusade: The Establishment of Preschool in the United States|year=1976|publisher=Athens: Ohio University Press|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary===
[[File:Mr. Shake Amargosa.jpg|thumb|Primary school students with their teacher, [[Colombia]], 2014]]
{{Main|Primary education}}
Primary (or elementary) education consists of the first five to seven years of formal, structured education. In general, primary education consists of six to eight years of schooling starting at the age of five or six, although this varies between, and sometimes within, countries. Globally, around 89% of children aged six to twelve are enrolled in primary education, and this proportion is rising.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, Education For All Monitoring Report 2008, Net Enrollment Rate in primary education&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Education For All]] programs driven by [[UNESCO]], most countries have committed to achieving universal enrollment in primary education by 2015, and in many countries, it is compulsory. The division between primary and [[secondary education]] is somewhat arbitrary, but it generally occurs at about eleven or twelve years of age. Some education systems have separate [[middle school]]s, with the transition to the final stage of secondary education taking place at around the age of fourteen. Schools that provide primary education, are mostly referred to as ''primary schools ''or ''elementary schools''. Primary schools are often subdivided into [[infant school]]s and [[junior school]].

In India, for example, [[Compulsory education#Variation in countries|compulsory education]] spans over twelve years, with eight years of elementary education, five years of primary schooling and three years of upper primary schooling. Various states in the republic of India provide 12 years of compulsory school education based on a national [[curriculum]] framework designed by the [[National Council of Educational Research and Training]].

===Secondary===

In most contemporary educational systems of the world, secondary education comprises the formal education that occurs during [[adolescence]]. It is characterized by transition from the typically compulsory, comprehensive [[primary education]] for [[minor (law)|minors]], to the optional, selective [[Tertiary education|tertiary]], "postsecondary", or "[[Higher education|higher]]" education (e.g. [[university]], vocational school) for [[adult]]s. Depending on the system, schools for this period, or a part of it, may be called secondary or [[high school]]s, [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]], [[lyceum]]s, middle schools, [[college]]s, or vocational schools. The exact meaning of any of these terms varies from one system to another. The exact boundary between primary and secondary education also varies from country to country and even within them but is generally around the seventh to the tenth year of schooling.

Secondary education occurs mainly during the teenage years. In the United States, Canada, and [[Australia]], primary and secondary education together are sometimes referred to as [[K–12 (education)|K-12]] education, and in New Zealand Year 1–13 is used. The purpose of secondary education can be to give [[common knowledge]], to prepare for [[higher education]], or to train directly in a [[profession]].

Secondary education in the United States did not emerge until 1910, with the rise of large corporations and advancing technology in factories, which required [[skilled worker]]s. In order to meet this new job demand, [[High school (North America)|high schools]] were created, with a curriculum focused on practical job skills that would better prepare students for [[White-collar worker|white collar]] or skilled [[Blue-collar worker|blue collar]] work. This proved beneficial for both employers and employees, since the improved human capital lowered costs for the employer, while skilled employees received higher wages.

Secondary education has a longer history in Europe, where grammar schools or academies date from as early as the 16th century, in the form of [[Public education|public schools]], [[fee-paying school]]s, or charitable educational foundations, which themselves date even further back.

[[Community college]]s offer another option at this transitional stage of education. They provide nonresidential junior college courses to people living in a particular area.

===Tertiary (higher)===

{{see also|Higher education|Adult education}}
[[File:Michelle Obama speaking at Peking university.jpg|thumb|Universities often host prominent guest speakers for student audiences, e.g. [[First Lady of the United States]] [[Michelle Obama]] delivering remarks at [[Peking University]], [[Beijing]], [[China]]]]
Higher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or postsecondary education, is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion of a school such as a high school or [[secondary school]]. Tertiary education is normally taken to include [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate education]], as well as [[vocational education|vocational education and training]]. Colleges and universities mainly provide tertiary education. Collectively, these are sometimes known as tertiary institutions. Individuals who complete tertiary education generally receive [[Academic certificate|certificates]], [[diploma]]s, or [[academic degree]]s.

Higher education typically involves work towards a degree-level or [[foundation degree]] qualification. In most developed countries, a high proportion of the population (up to 50%) now enter higher education at some time in their lives. Higher education is therefore very important to national [[economies]], both as a significant industry in its own right and as a source of trained and educated personnel for the rest of the economy.

University education includes teaching, research, and social services activities, and it includes both the undergraduate level (sometimes referred to as [[tertiary education]]) and the [[graduate student|graduate]] (or postgraduate) level (sometimes referred to as [[graduate school]]). Some universities are composed of several colleges.

One type of university education is a [[liberal arts]] education, which can be defined as a "[[college]] or [[university]] [[curriculum]] aimed at imparting broad general knowledge and developing general intellectual capacities, in contrast to a professional, [[vocational education|vocational]], or technical curriculum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Liberal Arts: ''Britannica Concise Encyclopædia''| work = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | url= http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9370154/liberal-arts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although what is known today as liberal arts education began in [[Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first =Philip | last =Harriman | title = Antecedents of the Liberal Arts College| year =1935|jstor=1975506 | pages =63–71 | volume =6 | issue =2 | journal =The Journal of Higher Education | ref =harv | doi =10.2307/1975506}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term "[[liberal arts college]]" is more commonly associated with institutions in the [[United States]] such as [[Williams College]] or [[Barnard College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=Inside Higher Ed|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/04/06/liberalarts|accessdate=2015-01-08|date=2009-04-06|first=Elizabeth|last=Redden|title=A Global Liberal Arts Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vocational===
[[File:Fotothek df n-10 0000828.jpg|thumb|Carpentry is normally learned through [[apprenticeship]] with an experienced carpenter]]
{{Main|Vocational education}}

[[Vocational education]] is a form of education focused on direct and practical training for a specific trade or craft. Vocational education may come in the form of an [[apprenticeship]] or [[internship]] as well as institutions teaching courses such as [[carpentry]], [[agriculture]], [[engineering]], [[medicine]], [[architecture]] and [[the arts]].

===Special===
{{Main|Special education}}
In the past, those who were disabled were often not eligible for public education. Children with disabilities were repeatedly denied an education by [[physicians]] or special tutors.  These early physicians (people like [[Itard]], [[Édouard Séguin|Seguin]], [[Samuel Gridley Howe|Howe]], [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet|Gallaudet]]) set the foundation for special education today. They focused on individualized instruction and functional skills.  In its early years, special education was only provided to people with severe disabilities, but more recently it has been opened to anyone who has experienced difficulty learning.&lt;ref name="Credo Reference"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Special Education|year=2004|publisher=Oxford: Elsevier Science and Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other educational forms==

===Alternative===
{{Main|Alternative education}}
While considered "alternative" today, most alternative systems have existed since ancient times. After the public school system was widely developed beginning in the 19th century, some parents found reasons to be discontented with the new system. [[Alternative education]] developed in part as a reaction to perceived limitations and failings of [[traditional education]]. A broad range of educational approaches emerged, including [[alternative school]]s, [[autodidacticism|self learning]], [[homeschooling]], and [[unschooling]]. Example [[alternative school]]s include [[Montessori method|Montessori schools]], [[Waldorf education|Waldorf schools]] (or [[Rudolf Steiner|Steiner]] schools), [[List of Friends Schools|Friends schools]], [[Sands School]], [[Summerhill School]], [[Walden's Path]], [[The Peepal Grove School]], [[Sudbury Valley School]], [[Jiddu Krishnamurti|Krishnamurti schools]], and [[open classroom]] schools. [[Charter school]]s are another example of alternative education, which have in the recent years grown in numbers in the US and gained greater importance in its public education system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED535992.pdf|title = Federal Investment in Charter Schools|date = October 2011|accessdate = 2 October 2015|website = Institute of Education Sciences|publisher = Center for American Progress|last = Lazarin|first = Melissa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/10/charter-schools_n_4419341.html|title = Charter Schools Continue Dramatic Growth Despite Controversies|date = 10 December 2013|accessdate = 2 October 2015|newspaper = The Huffington Post|last = Resmovits|first = Joy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In time, some ideas from these experiments and paradigm challenges may be adopted as the norm in education, just as [[Friedrich Fröbel]]'s approach to [[early childhood education]] in 19th-century Germany has been incorporated into contemporary [[kindergarten]] classrooms. Other influential writers and thinkers have included the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[humanitarianism|humanitarian]] [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]]; the [[United States|American]] [[transcendentalism|transcendentalists]] [[Amos Bronson Alcott]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]]; the founders of [[educational progressivism|progressive education]], [[John Dewey]] and [[Francis Wayland Parker|Francis Parker]]; and educational pioneers such as [[Maria Montessori]] and [[Rudolf Steiner]], and more recently [[John Caldwell Holt]], [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]], [[Frederick Mayer]], [[George Dennison]], and [[Ivan Illich]].

===Indigenous===
[[File:Schoolyard essay2.JPG|thumb|alt=Na Schoolyard.|[[Indigenous education|Teaching indigenous knowledge]], models, and methods in [[Yanyuan County]], [[Sichuan]], China]]
{{Main|Indigenous education}}
[[Indigenous education]] refers to the inclusion of indigenous knowledge, models, methods, and content within formal and non-formal educational systems. Often in a post-colonial context, the growing recognition and use of indigenous education methods can be a response to the erosion and loss of indigenous knowledge and language through the processes of colonialism. Furthermore, it can enable indigenous communities to "reclaim and revalue their languages and cultures, and in so doing, improve the educational success of indigenous students."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=3099875|author1=May, S.  |author2=Aikman, S. |title=Indigenous Education: Addressing Current Issues and Developments|journal=Comparative Education|volume= 39|issue=2 |year=2003|pages= 139–45|doi=10.1080/03050060302549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Informal learning===
{{main|Informal learning}}
'''Informal learning''' is one of three forms of learning defined by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD). Informal learning occurs in a variety of places, such as at [[home]], [[employment|work]], and through daily interactions and shared relationships among members of society.  For many learners, this includes [[language acquisition]], [[cultural norm]]s, and [[manners]].

In informal learning, there is often a reference person, a peer or expert, to guide the learner.  If learners have a personal interest in what they are informally being taught, learners tend to expand their existing knowledge and conceive new ideas about the topic being learned.&lt;ref name=Rogoff&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3102/0091732X16680994 | volume=40 | title=The Organization of Informal Learning | year=2016 | journal=Review of Research in Education | pages=356–401 | last1 = Rogoff | first1 = Barbara | last2 = Callanan | first2 = Maureen | last3 = Gutiérrez | first3 = Kris D. | last4 = Erickson | first4 = Frederick}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a museum is traditionally considered an informal learning environment, as there is room for free choice, a diverse and potentially non-standardized range of topics, flexible structures, socially rich interaction, and no externally imposed assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1017/cbo9781139519526.028 | title=Informal Learning in Museums | journal=The Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences | pages=461–478 | last1 = Crowley | first1 = Kevin | last2 = Pierroux | first2 = Palmyre | last3 = Knutson | first3 = Karen| year=2014 | isbn=978-1-139-51952-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While informal learning often takes place outside educational [[school|establishments]] and does not follow a specified curriculum, it can also occur within educational settings and even during formal learning situations. Educators can structure their lessons to directly utilize their students informal learning skills within the education setting.&lt;ref name=Rogoff/&gt;

In the late 19th century, education through play began to be recognized as making an important contribution to child development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first =GH | last =Mead | title = The Relation of Play to Education| journal = University Record| year =1896| pages =141–45 | volume =1 | url=http://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/Mead/pubs/Mead_1896.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, the concept was broadened to include young adults but the emphasis was on physical activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first =GE | last =Johnson | title = Education through recreation| publisher = Cleveland Foundation, Ohio| year =1916|  url=https://archive.org/stream/educationthrough00johnuoft#page/n5/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[L.P. Jacks]], also an early proponent of lifelong learning, described education through recreation: "A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play, his labour and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself, he always seems to be doing both. Enough for him that he does it well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =LP | last =Jacks | title = Education through recreation| publisher = New York: Harper and Brothers| year =1932| pages =1–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Education through recreation is the opportunity to learn in a seamless fashion through all of life's activities.&lt;ref name="Ullah 2012 165–170"&gt;{{cite journal | first =Sha | last =Ullah | title = Learning surgically oriented anatomy in a student-run extracurricular club: an education through recreation initiative| journal = Anat Sci Educ| year =2012| pages =165–70 | volume =5 |pmid=22434649 | doi=10.1002/ase.1273 | url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=1&amp;article=1175&amp;context=vivianmcalister&amp;type=additional | last2 =Bodrogi | first2 =Andrew | last3 =Cristea | first3 =Octav | last4 =Johnson | first4 =Marjorie | last5 =McAlister | first5 =Vivian C. | issue =3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been revived by the [[University of Western Ontario]] to teach [[anatomy]] to medical students.&lt;ref name="Ullah 2012 165–170"/&gt;

===Self-directed learning===
{{Main|Autodidacticism}}
[[Autodidacticism]] (also autodidactism) is a term used to describe self-directed learning. One may become an autodidact at nearly any point in one's life. [[List of autodidacts|Notable autodidacts]] include [[Abraham Lincoln]] (U.S. president), [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] (mathematician), [[Michael Faraday]] (chemist and physicist), [[Charles Darwin]] (naturalist), [[Thomas Alva Edison]] (inventor), [[Tadao Ando]] (architect), [[George Bernard Shaw]] (playwright), [[Frank Zappa]] (composer, recording engineer, film director), and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (engineer, scientist, mathematician).

===Open education and electronic technology===
{{main|Open education|Educational technology}}

Many large university institutions are now starting to offer free or almost free full courses such as [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] teaming up to form [[edX]]. Other universities offering open education are prestigious private universities such as [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Duke University|Duke]], [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]], the [[University of Pennsylvania|University of Pennylvania]], and [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], as well as notable public universities including [[Tsinghua University|Tsinghua]], [[Peking University|Peking]], [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], [[University of Michigan]], and [[University of Virginia]].

Open education has been called the biggest change in the way people learn since the printing press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neurobonkers.com/2012/08/02/the-single-biggest-change-in-the-way-we-learn-since-the-printing-press/ |title=Free courses provided by Harvard, MIT, Berkeley, Stanford, Princeton, Duke, Johns Hopkins, Edinburgh, U.Penn, U. Michigan, U. Virginia, U. Washington |publisher=Neurobonkers.com |date=2 August 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite favourable studies on effectiveness, many people may still desire to choose traditional campus education for social and cultural reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Harriet Swain |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/oct/01/university-campuses-decline-elearning-students? |title=Will university campuses soon be 'over'?  |work=The Guardian |accessdate=2012-10-24 |location=London |date=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many open universities are working to have the ability to offer students standardized testing and traditional degrees and credentials.&lt;ref&gt;Cloete, ElsabeÂ. "Electronic Education System Model." Department of Computer Science and Information Systems in South Africa, 17 Oct. 2000. Web. 3 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conventional merit-system degree is currently not as common in open education as it is in campus universities, although some [[open universities]] do already offer conventional degrees such as the [[Open University]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Presently, many of the major open education sources offer their own form of certificate. Due to the popularity of open education, these new kind of academic certificates are gaining more respect and equal "[[Academic capital|academic value]]" to traditional degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.good.is/posts/is-the-certificate-the-new-college-degree |title=Is the Certificate the New College Degree?  |publisher=Good.is |date=8 June 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of 182 colleges surveyed in 2009 nearly half said tuition for online courses was higher than for campus-based ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parry |first=M. |date=2010 |title=Such a Deal?

A recent meta-analysis found that online and blended educational approaches had better outcomes than methods that used solely face-to-face interaction.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education, [https://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/tech/evidence-based-practices/finalreport.pdf Evaluation of Evidence-Based Practices in Online Learning A Meta-Analysis and Review of Online Learning Studies], 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education sector ==
[[File:北师大西门.jpg|thumb|[[Beijing Normal University]], which is governed directly by the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Ministry of Education]], is an example of collaboration between different entities in the education sector]]
The education sector or education system is a group of institutions (ministries of education, local educational authorities, teacher training institutions, schools, universities, etc.) whose primary purpose is to provide education to children and young people in educational settings. It involves a wide range of people ([[curriculum]] developers, inspectors, school principals, teachers, school nurses, students, etc.). These institutions can vary according to different contexts.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002447/244756e.pdf|title=Out in the Open: Education sector responses to violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression|last=UNESCO|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100150-5|location=|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools deliver education, with support from the rest of the education system through various elements such as [[Education policy|education policies]] and guidelines – to which school policies can refer – curricula and learning materials, as well as pre- and in-service teacher training programmes. The school environment – both physical (infrastructures) and psychological (school climate) – is also guided by school policies that should ensure the well-being of students when they are in school.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] has found that schools tend to perform best when principals have full authority and responsibility for ensuring that students are proficient in core subjects upon graduation. They must also seek feedback from students for quality-assurance and improvement. Governments should limit themselves to monitoring student proficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The education sector is fully integrated into society, through interactions with a large number of stakeholders and other sectors. These include parents, local communities, religious leaders, NGOs, stakeholders involved in health, [[child protection]], justice and law enforcement (police), media and political leadership.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Several UN agencies have asserted that [[Comprehensive sex education|comprehensive sexuality education]] should be integrated into school curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|title=International technical guidance on sexuality education: An evidence-informed approach|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100259-5|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1909, the ratio of children in the developing world attending school has increased. Before then, a small minority of boys attended school. By the start of the 21st century, the majority of all children in most regions of the world attended school.

[[Universal Primary Education]] is one of the eight international [[Millennium Development Goals]], towards which progress has been made in the past decade, though barriers still remain.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Liesbet Steer and Geraldine Baudienville 2010. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4755&amp;title=funding-basic-education What drives donor financing of basic education?] London: [[Overseas Development Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt; Securing charitable funding from prospective donors is one particularly persistent problem. Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have indicated that the main obstacles to funding for education include conflicting donor priorities, an immature aid architecture, and a lack of evidence and advocacy for the issue.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Additionally, [[Transparency International]] has identified [[political corruption|corruption]] in the education sector as a major stumbling block to achieving Universal Primary Education in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Addis Ababa |url=http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases/2010/2010_02_23_aew_launch_en |title=Poor governance jeopardises primary education in Africa |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627021316/http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases/2010/2010_02_23_aew_launch_en |archive-date=27 June 2010 |website=Transparency International |date=23 February 2010 |access-date=2011-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, demand in the developing world for improved educational access is not as high as foreigners have expected. Indigenous governments are reluctant to take on the ongoing costs involved. There is also economic pressure from some parents, who prefer their children to earn money in the short term rather than work towards the long-term benefits of education.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

A study conducted by the [[UNESCO International Institute for Educational Planning]] indicates that stronger capacities in educational planning and management may have an important spill-over effect on the system as a whole.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite report |last=de Grauwe |first=A. |date=2009 |location=Paris |publisher=UNESCO-IIPE |url=http://www.iiep.unesco.org/en/capacity-development/capacity-development-strategies/synthesis.html |title=Capacity development strategies |accessdate=2010-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505082915/http://www.iiep.unesco.org/en/capacity-development/capacity-development-strategies/synthesis.html |archivedate=5 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable capacity development requires complex interventions at the institutional, organizational and individual levels that could be based on some foundational principles:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* national leadership and ownership should be the touchstone of any intervention;
* strategies must be context relevant and context specific;
* plans should employ an integrated set of complementary interventions, though implementation may need to proceed in steps;
* partners should commit to a long-term investment in capacity development while working towards some short-term achievements;
* outside intervention should be conditional on an impact assessment of national capacities at various levels;
* a certain percentage of students should be removed for improvisation of academics (usually practiced in schools, after 10th grade).

===Internationalization===
Nearly every country now has [[Universal Primary Education]].

Similarities – in systems or even in ideas – that schools share internationally have led to an increase in international student exchanges. The European Socrates-[[Erasmus]] Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erasmus.ac.uk |title=Socrates-Erasmus Program |publisher=Erasmus.ac.uk |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; facilitates exchanges across European universities. The [[Soros Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soros.org/ |title=Soros Foundation |publisher=Soros.org |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides many opportunities for students from central Asia and eastern Europe. Programs such as the [[International Baccalaureate]] have contributed to the internationalization of education. The global campus online, led by American universities, allows free access to class materials and lecture files recorded during the actual classes.

The [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] and the [[International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement]] objectively monitor and compare the proficiency of students from a wide range of different nations.

The internationalization of education is sometimes equated by critics with the westernization of education. These critics say that the internationalization of education leads to the erosion of local education systems and indigenous values and norms, which are replaced with Western systems and cultural and ideological values and orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sperduti|first1=Vanessa|date= 2017 |title=Internationalization as Westernization in Higher Education |url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59de47487131a5734282c4b7/t/5b86e96788251bfd43570fba/1535568231967/VSperduti+Spring+2017.pdf|journal= Comparative &amp; International Education 9 (2017)|volume= 9 |pages= 9–12|accessdate=2018-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education and technology in developing countries===
[[File:OLPC Haiti.jpg|thumb|right|The OLPC laptop being introduced to children in [[Haiti]]]]
{{Main|Education and technology}}

Technology plays an increasingly significant role in improving access to education for people living in impoverished areas and [[developing countries]]. However, lack of technological advancement is still causing barriers with regards to quality and access to education in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aleed |first1=Yasser |title=Effects of Education in Developing Countries |journal=Journal of Construction in Developing Countries |date=2016 |volume=December 2106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charities like [[One Laptop per Child]] are dedicated to providing infrastructures through which the disadvantaged may access educational materials.

The [[One Laptop per Child|OLPC foundation]], a group out of [[MIT Media Lab]] and supported by several major corporations, has a stated mission to develop a [[$100 laptop]] for delivering [[educational software]]. The laptops were widely available as of 2008. They are sold at cost or given away based on donations.

In Africa, the [[New Partnership for Africa's Development]] (NEPAD) has launched an "[[New Partnership for Africa's Development E-School Program|e-school program]]" to provide all 600,000 primary and high schools with computer equipment, learning materials and [[internet access]] within 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/network-wifi/3361705/african-nations-embrace-e-learning-says-new-report/ |title=African nations embrace e-learning, says new report |publisher=PC Advisor |date=16 October 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; An International Development Agency project called nabuur.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nabuur.com/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021011082942/http://www.nabuur.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2002-10-11 |title=nabuur.com |publisher=nabuur.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; started with the support of former American President [[Bill Clinton]], uses the [[Internet]] to allow co-operation by individuals on issues of social development.

===Private vs public funding in developing countries===
Research into LCPS (low-cost private schools) found that over 5 years to July 2013, debate around LCPSs to achieving [[Education for All]] (EFA) objectives was polarized and finding growing coverage in international policy.&lt;ref name=report&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eldis.org/go/display&amp;type=Document&amp;id=65993|title=Low-cost private schools: evidence, approaches and emerging issues|publisher=Eldis|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The polarization was due to disputes around whether the schools are affordable for the poor, reach disadvantaged groups, provide quality education, support or undermine equality, and are financially sustainable. The report examined the main challenges encountered by development organizations which support LCPSs.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; Surveys suggest these types of schools are expanding across Africa and Asia. This success is attributed to excess demand. These surveys found concern for:
* Equity: This concern is widely found in the literature, suggesting the growth in low-cost private schooling may be exacerbating or perpetuating already existing inequalities in developing countries, between urban and rural populations, lower- and higher-income families, and between girls and boys. The report findings suggest that girls may be underrepresented and that LCPS are reaching low-income families in smaller numbers than higher-income families.
* Quality and educational outcomes: It is difficult to generalize about the quality of private schools. While most achieve better results than government counterparts, even after their social background is taken into account, some studies find the opposite. Quality in terms of levels of teacher absence, teaching activity, and pupil to teacher ratios in some countries are better in LCPSs than in government schools.
* Choice and affordability for the poor: Parents can choose private schools because of perceptions of better-quality teaching and facilities, and an English language instruction preference. Nevertheless, the concept of 'choice' does not apply in all contexts, or to all groups in society, partly because of limited affordability (which excludes most of the poorest) and other forms of exclusion, related to caste or social status.
* Cost-effectiveness and financial sustainability: There is evidence that private schools operate at low cost by keeping teacher salaries low, and their financial situation may be precarious where they are reliant on fees from low-income households.

The report showed some cases of successful voucher and subsidy programs; evaluations of international support to the sector are not widespread.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; Addressing regulatory ineffectiveness is a key challenge. Emerging approaches stress the importance of understanding the political economy of the market for LCPS, specifically how relationships of power and accountability between users, government, and private providers can produce better education outcomes for the poor.

===Educational psychology===
{{Main|Educational psychology}}
[[Educational psychology]] is the study of how humans learn in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the [[social psychology]] of [[school]]s as [[organization]]s. Although the terms "educational psychology" and "school psychology" are often used interchangeably, researchers and theorists are likely to be identified as [[:Category:Educational psychologists|educational psychologists]], whereas practitioners in schools or school-related settings are identified as [[school psychologist]]s. Educational psychology is concerned with the processes of educational attainment in the general population and in sub-populations such as [[gifted]] children and those with specific [[disabilities]].
[[File:2013. Донецк 336.jpg|thumb|Knowledge Day in [[Donetsk]], [[Ukraine]], 2013]]
Educational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines. It is informed primarily by [[psychology]], bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between [[medicine]] and [[biology]]. Educational psychology, in turn, informs a wide range of specialties within educational studies, including [[instructional design]], [[educational technology]], curriculum development, [[organizational learning]], [[special education]] and [[classroom management]]. Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to [[cognitive science]] and the [[learning sciences]]. In universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks (Lucas, Blazek, &amp; Raley, 2006).

===The intelligence–education relationship===
{{Main|Psychology of education}}
[[Intelligence]] is an important factor in how the individual responds to education. Those who have higher intelligence tend to perform better at school and go on to higher levels of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Butler | first1 = S. | last2 = Marsh | first2 = H. | last3 = Sheppard | first3 = J. | year = 1985 | title = Seven year longitudinal study of the early prediction of reading achievement | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 77 | issue = 3| pages = 349–61 | doi=10.1037/0022-0663.77.3.349}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is also observable in the opposite direction, in that education increases measurable intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baltes | first1 = P. | last2 = Reinert | first2 = G. | year = 1969 | title = Cohort effects in cognitive development in children as revealed by cross sectional sequences | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 169–77 | doi=10.1037/h0026997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that while educational attainment is important in predicting intelligence in later life, intelligence at 53 is more closely correlated to intelligence at 8 years old than to educational attainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Richards | first1 = M. | last2 = Sacker | first2 = A. | year = 2003 | title = Lifetime Antecedents of Cognitive Reserve | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology | volume = 25 | issue = 5| pages = 614–24 | doi=10.1076/jcen.25.5.614.14581| pmid = 12815499 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning modalities===
There has been much interest in learning modalities and styles over the last two decades. The most commonly employed learning modalities are:&lt;ref&gt;Swassing, R. H., Barbe, W. B., &amp; Milone, M. N. (1979). ''The Swassing-Barbe Modality Index: Zaner-Bloser Modality Kit''. Columbus, OH: Zaner-Bloser.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Visual]]: learning based on observation and seeing what is being learned.
* [[Hearing (sense)|Auditory]]: learning based on listening to instructions/information.
* [[Kinesthetic]]: learning based on movement, e.g. hands-on work and engaging in activities.

Other commonly employed modalities include [[music]]al, [[interpersonal]], [[Verbal reasoning|verbal]], [[logical]], and [[intrapersonal]].

Dunn and Dunn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learningstyles.net/ |title=Dunn and Dunn |publisher=Learningstyles.net | accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; focused on identifying relevant stimuli that may influence learning and manipulating the school environment, at about the same time as [[Joseph Renzulli]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/renzulli.shtml |title=Biographer of Renzulli |publisher=Indiana.edu | accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommended varying teaching strategies. [[Howard Gardner]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomasarmstrong.com/multiple_intelligences.htm Thomas Armstrong's website] detailing Multiple Intelligences&lt;/ref&gt; identified a wide range of modalities in his [[Multiple Intelligences]] theories. The [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]] and [[Keirsey Temperament Sorter]], based on the works of [[Jung]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keirsey.com/ |title=Keirsey web-site |publisher=Keirsey.com | accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; focus on understanding how people's personality affects the way they interact personally, and how this affects the way individuals respond to each other within the learning environment. The work of [[David Kolb]] and [[Anthony Gregorc]]'s Type Delineator&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.algonquincollege.com/edtech/gened/styles.html |title=Type Delineator description |publisher=Algonquincollege.com |accessdate=2009-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301064219/http://algonquincollege.com/edtech/gened/styles.html |archivedate=1 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; follows a similar but more simplified approach.

Some theories propose that all individuals benefit from a variety of learning modalities, while others suggest that individuals may have preferred learning styles, learning more easily through visual or kinesthetic experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Barbe, W. B., &amp; Swassing, R. H., with M. N. Milone. (1979). ''Teaching through modality strengths: Concepts and practices''. Columbus, OH: Zaner-Bloser&lt;/ref&gt; A consequence of the latter theory is that effective teaching should present a variety of teaching methods which cover all three learning modalities so that different students have equal opportunities to learn in a way that is effective for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C005704/content_hwl_learningmodalities.php3 |title=Learning modality description from the Learning Curve website |publisher=Library.thinkquest.org |accessdate=2010-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404234142/http://library.thinkquest.org/C005704/content_hwl_learningmodalities.php3 |archivedate=4 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guy Claxton has questioned the extent that [[learning styles]] such as Visual, Auditory and Kinesthetic(VAK) are helpful, particularly as they can have a tendency to label children and therefore restrict learning.&lt;ref name="titleGuy Claxton speaking on What's The Point of School"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dystalk.com/talks/49-whats-the-point-of-school |title=Guy Claxton speaking on What's The Point of School?|publisher=dystalk.com |accessdate=2009-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Learner%20Responsibility.pdf | title = Learner Responsibility in Management Education, or Ventures into Forbidden Research (with Comments) | author = J.

Several academic institutions around the world are beginning to devote resources to the establishment of educational neuroscience research.

===Philosophy===
[[File:LockeEducation1693.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[John Locke]]'s work ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]'' was written in 1693 and still reflects traditional education priorities in the Western world.]]
{{Main|Philosophy of education}}
As an academic field, philosophy of education is "the philosophical study of education and its problems&amp;nbsp;(...) its central subject matter is education, and its methods are those of [[philosophy]]".&lt;ref name=NoddingsPOE&gt;{{Cite book | last = Noddings| first = Nel| title = Philosophy of Education| publisher = Westview Press| year = 1995| location = Boulder, CO| isbn = 978-0-8133-8429-0|page=1|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The philosophy of education may be either the philosophy of the process of education or the philosophy of the discipline of education. That is, it may be part of the discipline in the sense of being concerned with the aims, forms, methods, or results of the process of educating or being educated; or it may be metadisciplinary in the sense of being concerned with the concepts, aims, and methods of the discipline."&lt;ref name=POEE&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Frankena | first1 = William K. | last2 = Raybeck | first2 = Nathan | last3 = Burbules | first3 = Nicholas | contribution = Philosophy of Education | year = 2002 | title = Encyclopedia of Education, 2nd edition | editor-last = Guthrie | editor-first = James W. | place = New York, NY | publisher = Macmillan Reference | isbn= 978-0-02-865594-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it is both part of the field of education and a field of [[applied philosophy]], drawing from fields of [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[axiology]] and the philosophical approaches ([[speculative philosophy|speculative]], prescriptive or [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]]) to address questions in and about [[pedagogy]], [[education policy]], and [[curriculum]], as well as the process of [[learning theory (education)|learning]], to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Noddings|1995|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it might study what constitutes upbringing and education, the values and norms revealed through upbringing and educational practices, the limits and legitimization of education as an academic discipline, and the relation between [[education theory]] and practice.

===Purpose of education===
There is no broad consensus as to what education's chief aim or aims are or should be. Different places, and at different times, have used educational systems for different purposes.  The [[Prussian education system]] in the 19th century, for example, wanted to turn boys and girls into adults who would serve the state's political goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eEOLV_TtNfQC|title=Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia, 1600-1947|last=Clark|first=Christopher|date=2007-09-06|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=978-0-14-190402-3|location=|pages=|language=en|quote=The emancipated citizens who emerged from every level of Humboldt's educational system were expected to take an active part in the political life of the Prussian state.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mommsen|first=Peter|date=Winter 2019|title=The Community of Education|url=https://www.plough.com/en/topics/community/education/editors-letter-issue-19|journal=Plough Quarterly|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors stress its value to the individual, emphasizing its potential for positively influencing students' personal development, promoting autonomy, forming a cultural identity or establishing a career or occupation. Other authors emphasize education's contributions to societal purposes, including good citizenship, shaping students into productive members of society, thereby promoting society's general economic development, and preserving cultural values.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Winch and John Gingell, ''Philosophy of Education: The Key Concepts'' (2nd edition). London:Routledge, 2008. pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The purpose of education in a given time and place affects who is taught, what is taught, and how the education system behaves.  For example, in the 21st century, many countries treat education as a [[positional good]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=March 2016|editor-last=Park|editor-first=Hyunjoon|editor2-last=Shavit|editor2-first=Yossi|title=Special Issue:  Education as a Positional Good|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/research-in-social-stratification-and-mobility/vol/43/suppl/C|journal=Research in Social Stratification and Mobility|volume=43 (supplement)|pages=1–70|issn=0276-5624|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this competitive approach, people want their own students to get a better education than other students.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This approach can lead to unfair treatment of some students, especially those from disadvantaged or marginalized groups.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  For example, in this system, a city's school system may draw school district boundaries so that nearly all the students in one school are from low-income families, and that nearly all the students in the neighboring schools come from more affluent families, even though concentrating low-income students in one school results in worse educational achievement for the entire school system.

===Curriculum===
{{Main|Curriculum|Curriculum theory|List of academic disciplines}}
In formal education, a [[curriculum]] is the set of courses and their content offered at a [[school]] or [[university]]. As an idea, '''curriculum''' stems from the [[Latin]] word for ''[[race course]]'', referring to the course of [[wikt:deed|deeds]] and experiences through which [[child]]ren grow to become mature [[adult]]s. A curriculum is prescriptive and is based on a more general [[syllabus]] which merely specifies what topics must be understood and to what level to achieve a particular grade or standard.

An [[List of academic disciplines|academic discipline]] is a branch of knowledge which is formally taught, either at the university – or via some other such method. Each discipline usually has several sub-disciplines or branches, and distinguishing lines are often both arbitrary and ambiguous. Examples of broad areas of academic disciplines include the [[natural science]]s, [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[social science]]s, [[humanities]] and [[applied science]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.curriculumonline.gov.uk/Default.htm |title=Examples of subjects |publisher=Curriculumonline.gov.uk |accessdate=2009-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821105825/http://www.curriculumonline.gov.uk/default.htm |archivedate=21 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational institutions may incorporate [[fine arts]] as part of K-12 grade curricula or within majors at [[college]]s and universities as electives.  The various types of fine arts are music, dance, and theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationworld.com/standards/national/arts/index.shtml |title=Fine Arts |publisher=Education World |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sudbury Valley School]] offers a model of education without a curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gray |first=Scott |date=2011 |title=Sherlock Holmes was Wrong. |journal=The Sudbury Valley School Journal |volume=40 |issue=2 |url=https://sudburyvalley.org/essays/sherlock-holmes-was-wrong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instruction===
Instruction is the facilitation of another's learning. Instructors in primary and secondary institutions are often called [[teacher]]s, and they direct the education of [[student]]s and might draw on many [[course (education)|subjects]] like [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[writing]], [[mathematics]], [[science]] and [[history]]. Instructors in post-secondary institutions might be called [[teacher]]s, instructors, or [[professor]]s, depending on the type of institution; and they primarily teach only their specific discipline. Studies from the United States suggest that the quality of teachers is the single most important factor affecting student performance, and that countries which score highly on international tests have multiple policies in place to ensure that the teachers they employ are as effective as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Winters |first=Marcus |title=Teachers Matter: Rethinking How Public Schools Identify, Reward, and Retain Great Educators |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |page=160 |isbn=978-1-4422-1077-6|year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WRS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mckinsey.com/App_Media/Reports/SSO/Worlds_School_Systems_Final.pdf |title=How the world's best-performing school systems come out on top |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927092821/http://www.mckinsey.com/App_Media/Reports/SSO/Worlds_School_Systems_Final.pdf |archive-date=27 September 2011 |website=mckinsey.com |date=September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the passing of NCLB in the United States (No Child Left Behind), teachers must be highly qualified. A popular way to gauge teaching performance is to use student evaluations of teachers (SETS), but these evaluations have been criticized for being counterproductive to learning and inaccurate due to student bias.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113 |title=Natural Learning in Higher Education |author=J.

College basketball coach [[John Wooden]] the Wizard of Westwood would teach through quick "This not That" technique. He would show (a) the correct way to perform an action, (b) the incorrect way the player performed it, and again (c) the correct way to perform an action. This helped him to be a responsive teacher and fix errors on the fly. Also, less communication from him meant more time that the player could practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Coyle |first1=Daniel |title=The Talent Code |publisher=Bantam Books |isbn=978-0-553-80684-7 |page=159|year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics of education==

[[File:Students, Hakha, Chin State, Myanmar.jpg|thumb|right|Students on their way to school, [[Hakha]], [[Chin State]], [[Burma|Myanmar]]]]
It has been argued that high rates of education are essential for countries to be able to achieve high levels of [[economic growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Eric A. Hanushek|title=Economic outcomes and school quality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=na7rAAAACAAJ|accessdate=21 October 2011|year=2005|publisher=International Institute for Educational Planning|isbn=978-92-803-1279-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical analyses tend to support the theoretical prediction that poor countries should grow faster than rich countries because they can adopt cutting edge technologies already tried and tested by rich countries. However, [[technology transfer]] requires knowledgeable managers and engineers who are able to operate new machines or production practices borrowed from the leader in order to close the gap through imitation. Therefore, a country's ability to learn from the leader is a function of its stock of "[[human capital]]".

Economists [[Samuel Bowles (economist)|Samuel Bowles]] and Herbert Gintis argued in 1976 that there was a fundamental conflict in American schooling between the [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] goal of democratic participation and the inequalities implied by the continued profitability of capitalist production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Samuel Bowles|author2=Herbert Gintis|title=Schooling In Capitalist America: Educational Reform and the Contradictions of Economic Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LcpLPKOL6XYC|accessdate=21 October 2011|date=18 October 2011|publisher=Haymarket Books|isbn=978-1-60846-131-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The future of education==

Many countries are now drastically changing the way they educate their citizens. The world is changing at an ever quickening rate, which means that a lot of knowledge becomes obsolete and inaccurate more quickly. The emphasis is therefore shifting to teaching the skills of learning: to picking up new knowledge quickly and in as agile a way as possible. Finnish schools have even begun to move away from the regular subject-focused curricula, introducing instead developments like phenomenon-based learning, where students study concepts like climate change instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oph.fi/english/curricula_and_qualifications/basic_education/curricula_2014|title=Finnish National Agency for Education - Curricula 2014|website=www.oph.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also active [[Educational interventions for first-generation students|educational interventions]] to implement programs and paths specific to non-traditional students, such as [[First-generation college students in the United States|first generation students]]. 

Education is also becoming a commodity no longer reserved for children. Adults need it too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sitra.fi/en/articles/for-many-people-flexibility-at-work-can-be-a-liberation-matthew-taylor-chief-executive-royal-society-of-arts/|title=For many people, flexibility at work can be a liberation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some governmental bodies, like the Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra in Finland, have even proposed compulsory lifelong education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sitra.fi/en/articles/compulsory-education-last-lifetime/|title=Could compulsory education last a lifetime? - Sitra|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In 2012 alone, an estimated 6,500 former military personnel died by suicide. More active duty veterans, 177, succumbed to suicide that year than were killed in combat, 176. The [[United States Army|Army]] suffered 52% of the suicides from all branches.&lt;ref name="Pilkington"/&gt;

In 2013, the VA released a study that covered suicides from 1999 to 2010, which showed that roughly 22 veterans were dying by suicide per day, or one every 65 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;February 1, 2013.

In August 2016, the VA released a new report which consisted of the nation's largest analysis of veteran suicide. The report reviewed more than 55 million veterans' records from 1979 to 2014 from every state in the nation. The previous report from 2012 was primarily limited to data on veterans who used VHA health services or from mortality records obtained directly from 20 states and approximately 3 million records. Compared to the data from the 2012 report, which estimated the number of Veteran deaths by suicide to be 22 per day, the current analysis indicates that in 2014, an average of 20 veterans a day died from suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VA Releases Report on Nation's Largest Analysis of Veteran Suicide|url=http://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=2807|website=Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social policy: history of veteran suicide prevention ==
The first suicide prevention center in the United States was opened in Los Angeles in 1958 with funding from the U.S. Public Health Service. In 1966, the Center for Studies of Suicide Prevention (later the Suicide Research Unit) was established at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Later on, in 1970, the NIMH pushed in Phoenix the discussion about the status of suicide prevention, presented relevant findings about suicide rate and identified the future directions and priorities of the topic.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK109918/|title=Brief History of Suicide Prevention in the United States|last=(us)|first=Office of the Surgeon General|last2=(us)|first2=National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention|date=2012-09-01|publisher=US Department of Health &amp; Human Services (US)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it wasn't until mid-1990s when suicide started being the central issue of the political-social agenda of the United States. Survivors from suicide began to mobilize encouraging the development of a national strategy for suicide prevention. Finally, two Congressional Resolutions—S. Res. 84 and H. Res. 212 of the 105th Congress—recognized suicide as a national problem and suicide prevention as a national priority.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As recommended in the U.N. guidelines, these groups set out to establish a public and private partnership that would be responsible for promoting suicide prevention in the United States. This innovative public-private partnership jointly sponsored a national consensus conference on suicide prevention in Reno, Nevada, which developed a list of 81 recommendations&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Key points from Reno, Nevada, conference ===
# Suicide prevention must recognize and affirm the value, dignity, and importance of each person.
# Suicide is not solely the result of illness or inner conditions. The feelings of hopelessness that contribute to suicide can stem from societal conditions and attitudes. Therefore, everyone concerned with suicide prevention shares a responsibility to help change attitudes and eliminate the conditions of oppression, racism, homophobia, discrimination, and prejudice.
# Some groups are disproportionately affected by these societal conditions, and some are at greater risk for suicide.
# Individuals, communities, organizations, and leaders at all levels should collaborate to promote suicide prevention.
# The success of this strategy ultimately rests with individuals and communities across the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Federal policy initiatives ===
One of the most important laws about Veterans' Suicide Prevention is the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act (JOVSPA) of 2007, supporting the creation of a comprehensive program to reduce the incidence of suicide among veterans. Named for a veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom who died by suicide in 2005, the act directed the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to implement a comprehensive suicide prevention program for veterans. Components include staff education, mental health assessments as part of overall health assessments, a suicide prevention coordinator at each VA medical facility, research efforts, 24-hour mental health care, a toll-free crisis line, and outreach to and education for veterans and their families. In the summer of 2009, VA added a one-to-one “chat service” for veterans who prefer to reach out for assistance using the Internet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2010, the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention was created and, in 2012, the National Strategy was revised. With Obama’s administration suicide prevention strategies for veterans expanded and a goal was formed to make the process of finding and obtaining mental health resources easier for veterans, work to retain and recruit mental health professionals, and make the government programs more accountable for the people they serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/13/us/politics/obama-signs-suicide-prevention-for-veterans-act-into-law.html|title=Obama Signs Suicide Prevention for Veterans Act Into Law|last=Baker|first=Peter|date=2015-02-12|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-16|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/09/10/presidential-proclamation-world-suicide-prevention-day-2016|title=Presidential Proclamation -- World Suicide Prevention Day, 2016|date=2016-09-09|work=whitehouse.gov|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prevention hotline ===
In 2011, the National Veterans Suicide Prevention Hotline was renamed the Veterans Crisis Line (VCL).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.veteranscrisisline.net/mobile/About/AboutVeteransCrisisLine.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The primary mission of the VCL is “to provide 24/7, world-class suicide prevention and crisis intervention services to Veterans, Servicemembers, and their family members.”&lt;ref&gt;VCL Mission Statement&lt;/ref&gt; The VCL faces a number of challenges. It must meet the operational and business demands of responding to over 500,000 calls per year, along with thousands of electronic chats and text messages, and initiating rescue processes when indicated. It must also train staff to respond to Veterans and their family members in individual encounters during which a responder must make an accurate assessment of the needs of the caller under stressful, time-sensitive conditions.

Since its inception in July 2007, the VCL has answered over 3 million calls and initiated the dispatch of emergency services to callers in imminent crisis over 84,000 times. Since launching chat in 2009 and text services in November 2011, the VCL has answered nearly 359,000 and nearly 78,000 requests for chat and text services, respectively. In addition, staff has forwarded more than 504,000 referrals to local VA Suicide Prevention Coordinators on behalf of Veterans to ensure continuity of care with Veterans’ local VA providers. For FY 2016, more than 51,000 chats and 17,000 texts were answered by VCL responders. For FY 2017, nearly 54,000 chats and nearly 16,000 texts were answered by VCL responders. Emergency services were dispatched to over 12,000 callers in immediate crisis in FY 2016, and nearly 19,000 callers in immediate crisis in FY 2017. For FY 2016, nearly 87,000 referrals were made to local Suicide Prevention Coordinators for follow-up care and over 95,000 referrals were made in FY 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.va.gov/finance/docs/afr/2017VAafrSectionIII.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Federal budget ==
The [[Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018|2018 federal budget]] expanded mental health screenings for veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.militarytimes.com/veterans/2018/03/22/budget-omnibus-includes-new-mental-health-care-for-other-than-honorable-vets/ |title=Budget omnibus includes new mental health care for other-than-honorable vets |last=Shane |first=Leo |date=March 22, 2018 |work=Military Times |access-date=May 28, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

A study published in the ''Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine'' found that,
{{quote|Combat veterans are not only more likely to have [[suicidal ideation]], often associated with [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)]] and depression, but they are more likely to act on a suicidal plan. Especially since veterans may be less likely to seek help from a mental health professional, non-mental health physicians are in a key position to screen for PTSD, depression, and suicidal ideation in these patients.}}

The same study also found that in veterans with PTSD related to [[combat]] experience, combat-related guilt may be a significant predictor of suicidal ideation and attempts.&lt;ref&gt;Leo Sher, MD. Maria Dolores Braquehais, MD, PhD. Miquel Casas, MD, PhD. [http://ccjm.org/content/79/2/92.full Posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and suicide in veterans]. {{doi|10.3949/ccjm.79a.11069}}. Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine. February 2012. vol. 79 2 92-97. Retrieved: 25 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig Bryan of the [[University of Utah]] National Center for Veterans Studies said that veterans have the same risk factors for suicide as the general population, including feelings of depression, hopelessness, post-traumatic stress disorder, a history of trauma, and access to firearms.&lt;ref name= news21/&gt;

A study done by the ''Department of Veterans Affairs'' discovered that veterans are more likely to develop symptoms of PTSD for a number of reasons such as:

* Longer times at war
* Lower level of education
* More severe combat conditions
* Other soldiers around them killed
* Brain/head trauma
* Female gender

The ''Department of Veterans Affairs'' also discovered that where you were deployed and which branch of military you are with can also have drastic effects on your mental status after returning from service. As in most combat wars, your experiences will vary depending on where you are stationed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/ptsd-overview/reintegration/overview-mental-health-effects.asp|title=Mental Health Effects of Serving in Afghanistan and Iraq - PTSD: National Center for PTSD|website=www.ptsd.va.gov|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of this reporting such as author [[Tim Worstall]] in Feb. 2013 claim that there is no epidemic when comparing similar demographic cohorts in the civilian population. He points out that since vets are predominantly male, the suicide rate to compare to is not the general civilian rate, but the rate for males.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/02/02/but-there-isnt-an-epidemic-of-suicide-in-the-us-military/ But There Isn't An Epidemic Of Suicide In The US Military]. By [[Tim Worstall]]. Feb 2, 2013. ''[[Forbes]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protective factors ==
Veterans have difficulty transitioning from the Military to civilian life. Many choose to transition by Utilizing their GI Bill or other education benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ostovary|first=Fariba|last2=Dapprich|first2=Janet|date=December 2011|title=Challenges and opportunities of Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans with disabilities transitioning into learning and workplace environments|journal=New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education|volume=2011|issue=132|pages=63–73|doi=10.1002/ace.432|issn=1052-2891}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pursuit of education often facilitates the transition to civilian life. The pursuit of education among Veterans can aggravate post service conditions that are linked to a higher likelihood of suicide but often aids in the transition to civilian life&lt;ref name="Elliott 279–296"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elliott|first=Marta|last2=Gonzalez|first2=Carlene|last3=Larsen|first3=Barbara|date=July 2011|title=U.S. Military Veterans Transition to College: Combat, PTSD, and Alienation on Campus|journal=Journal of Student Affairs Research and Practice|volume=48|issue=3|pages=279–296|doi=10.2202/1949-6605.6293|issn=1949-6591}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holland|first=Jason M.|last2=Malott|first2=Jesse|last3=Currier|first3=Joseph M.|date=2013-12-05|title=Meaning Made of Stress among Veterans Transitioning to College: Examining Unique Associations with Suicide Risk and Life-Threatening Behavior|journal=Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior|volume=44|issue=2|pages=218–231|doi=10.1111/sltb.12061|issn=0363-0234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Veterans pursuing education, especially those utilizing the post 9/11 GI Bill, are more likely to have protective factors related to socialization and reintegration than those who are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Castro|first=Carl A.|last2=Kintzle|first2=Sara|last3=Hassan|first3=Anthony M.|date=2015|title=The combat veteran paradox: Paradoxes and dilemmas encountered with reintegrating combat veterans and the agencies that support them.|journal=Traumatology|volume=21|issue=4|pages=299–310|doi=10.1037/trm0000049|issn=1085-9373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Difficulty relating to fellow students
* Difficulty in coping with military experiences in an academic environment
* Lack of support or understanding for Service Connected Disabilities
* Negative stigmas related to Military Service
* Feelings of isolation
* Feelings of separation
* Lack of social support
* Difficulty with stable or reliable income
* Difficulty with stable housing

Although higher education has presented many difficulties to returning Veterans, research supports that Veterans often benefit from transitioning from the military into higher education.&lt;ref name="Elliott 279–296"/&gt; Academic life often requires Student Veterans to work and interact with other classmates. Most Academic Institutions have Student Veteran Organizations and Resources centers specifically to Aid Military Veterans. Military Education benefits, Primarily the Post 9/11 GI Bill, pay the cost of tuition and provide a housing stipend to Student Veterans. Education benefits often give Veteran Students an income,&lt;ref name="Elliott 279–296"/&gt; a goal to continue to work towards and socialization with the general population.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Smith|first=Natesha|title=Complexities of culture : understanding the identity of female veterans transitioning from military to college.|publisher=University of Louisville|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.18297/etd/1353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Commission on Teaching and America's Future''' '''(NCTAF)''' is a non-profit, non-partisan [[education policy]] advocacy organization based in [[Washington, D.C.]] Founded in 1994 by then-[[North Carolina governor]] [[Jim Hunt]] and [[Stanford University]] professor [[Linda Darling-Hammond]], the NCTAF focuses its research on improving the [[Teacher|teaching]] profession through recruitment, development, and retention of skilled teachers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/teacherbeat/2017/01/learning_forward_and_the_natio.html?cmp=SOC-SHR-FB|title=Learning Forward Merges With the National Commission on Teaching|last=Will|first=Madeline|website=Education Week - Teacher Beat|access-date=2018-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=National Commission on Teaching and America's Future|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Educational Reform and Dissent.|publisher=SAGE Publications|location=Thousand Oaks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JSh1AwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=nctaf%20encyclopedia&amp;pg=PA609#v=onepage&amp;q=nctaf&amp;f=false|accessdate=2018-12-18|date=2010|isbn=978-1-4522-6573-5|last2=Carper|first2=James C.

== Background ==
In its 1996 report "What Matters Most: Teaching for America's Future," the NCTAF issued broad recommendations for education leaders and state policymakers to, among other things, overhaul [[teacher education]] programs, establish state boards of professional teaching standards, strengthen teacher licensure standards, implement teacher mentoring programs, and create teacher compensation policies that reward knowledge and expertise.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/109598085/abstract/F2071D9EC8E4DB4PQ/1|title=Education Panel Sees Deep Flaws In Training of Nation's Teachers: Quarter of New U.S. Teachers Lack Skills, Report Contends|last=Applebome|first=Peter|date=1996|work=New York Times|accessdate=2018-12-19|location=New York|pages=A1|issn=03624331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report had wide-reaching impact, with seven states, including Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri, North Carolina, and Ohio, signing on to be partners in implementing the report's recommendations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/tm/articles/1996/09/04/02nctaf.h08.html|title=Teaching Matters|last=Bradley|first=Ann|date=1996-09-04|work=Education Week - Teacher|access-date=2018-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

In 2001, the NCTAF appointed former US federal election official Tom Carrol its executive director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2001/11/28/13nctaf.h21.html|title=Commission on Teaching Appoints New Leadership at Critical Juncture|last=Archer|first=Jeff|date=2001-11-28|work=Education Week|access-date=2018-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll announced his retirement in 2014. He was succeeded by Melinda George.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ewa.org/press-release/nctaf-president-tom-carroll-retire-march-1|title=NCTAF President Tom Carroll to Retire March 1|website=Education Writers Association|language=en|access-date=2018-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

== History ==
Hellointern was founded in 2006 an it was the first portal to provide free internship opportunity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.livemint.com/Politics/w3FGp4nDgkUJpGKomrkjMO/Internships-gaining-currency-startups-the-new-favourites.html|title=Internships gaining currency, start-ups the new favourites|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The platform was developed on very basic level of framework and was having more than 2000+ active users at that time. In 2008 it witnessed an exponential growth and was later acquired by Angaros Group in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/features/education/college-and-university/that-vital-link/article4840795.ece|title=That vital link|last=Srinivasan|first=Madhumitha|date=2013-06-23|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-12-23|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thestartupjournal.com/hellointern-com-connecting-interns-future/|title=HelloIntern.com – Connecting Interns With Their Future|date=2014-10-20|website=The Startup Journal - Indian Startup Stories, Startup News, Startup Resources, Interviews|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

After its acquisition, Hellointern started to spread its wing towards the global outreach with the tagline '''"The Global Intern Expert"'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/score-with-experience/article4785945.ece|title=Score with experience|date=2013-06-06|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-12-23|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/getahead/slide-show/slide-show-1-career-tips-to-get-job-ready-in-college/20120816.htm|title=Look beyond classrooms: Get job-ready in college|website=Rediff|access-date=2018-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The platform allows companies to list there internship requirement with or without stipend&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/education/edex/2013/apr/22/the-perks-of-internships-470140.html|title=The perks of internships|website=The New Indian Express|access-date=2018-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Partnerships ==
In the year, 2014 the technology team of the Angaros group developed its core framework as they want to expand globally. 

Later from 2015, Hellointern started doing partnerships with some renowned colleges like [[Indian Institute of Technology Madras|IIT Madras]], [[Indian Institute of Technology Bombay|IIT Bombay]], [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani|Bits Pilani]] and may other colleges for there events and helped students for the internships&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tamil.thehindu.com/society/lifestyle/article23521599.ece|title=நீங்கள் இண்டெர்ன்ஷிப்புக்குத் தயாரா?|last=சைபர்சிம்மன்|website=இந்து தமிழ் திசை|language=ta|access-date=2018-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=bitscan|last=|first=|publisher=https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/uploads/A.Hyd%202014-15/BITScan/BITSCAN%20Jan%2014toDec14.pdf|year=2014|isbn=|location=https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/uploads/A.Hyd%202014-15/BITScan/BITSCAN%20Jan%2014toDec14.pdf|pages=https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/uploads/A.Hyd%202014-15/BITScan/BITSCAN%20Jan%2014toDec14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the year 2018, they also partnered with few of the best online training institutes like Digital Vidya, Whizlabs and started supporting students with the online training courses.

== Programs ==
They have many programs for the students as summer internship&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://money.bhaskar.com/news/MON-ECN-POLI-these-5-best-summer-part-time-jobs-can-earn-you-upto-15k-business-news-hindi-5599397-PH.html|title=गर्मी की छुट्टी में करें ये 5 पार्ट टाइम जॉब, होगी 15 हजार तक की इनकम|date=2017-05-16|website=MoneyBhaskar|language=hi|access-date=2018-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and winter internships and global internships programmes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/platforms-that-help-you-bag-internships/articleshow/57881092.cms|title=Platforms that help you bag internships - Times of India|website=The Times of India|access-date=2018-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which helps students to find internships across the globe&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eenadu.net/special-pages/chaduvu/chadhuvu-inner.aspx?item=Chaduvu&amp;no=21163|title=Best Jobs and Internship in Summer|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Reach Every Reader''' is a five-year initiative supported by a $30 million grant from [[Chan Zuckerberg Initiative]] co-founders [[Priscilla Chan (philanthropist)|Priscilla Chan]] and [[Facebook]] CEO [[Mark Zuckerberg]]. Reach Every Reader was launched by faculty at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s Integrated Learning Initiative, and involves collaborators at the [[Florida Center for Reading Research]] and [[Florida State University College of Communication and Information]], and the [[Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools|Charlotte-Mecklenburg School District]] in [[North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="harvard.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/03/30m-grant-launches-reach-every-reader-in-effort-to-end-literacy-crisis/|title=$30M grant launches Reach Every Reader in effort to end literacy crisis|date=6 March 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collaboration consists of five projects:

* Diagnostic Screener
* Personalized Intervention
* PreK Home and Family Engagement
* Capacity Building for Educators and Families
* Integration and Building for the Future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://albertconsulting.com/reach-every-reader-aims-end-early-literacy-crisis/|title=Reach Every Reader Aims to End Early Literacy Crisis|first=205 Worth|last=Avenue|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reach Every Reader will develop a web-based screening tool for reading difficulties that diagnoses underlying causes. The diagnostic screening tool will identify kindergarteners who are at high risk for reading difficulty. The goal is to make this type of screening available to all children.&lt;ref name="harvard.edu"/&gt; 

The collaboration will also examine which interventions work for which students in order to work toward the development of personalized interventions.&lt;ref name="mit.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-and-harvard-join-forces-address-early-childhood-literacy-0306|title=MIT and Harvard join forces to address early childhood literacy|website=MIT News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers will work with schools to deliver their interventions to kindergarten students in summer programs and eventually implement them in the school curriculum.&lt;ref name="mit.edu"/&gt;

Concern has been expressed that the project involves "crisis talk" that creates pressure for children, and that parents may be concerned about the tracking of their children's personal information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nancyebailey.com/2018/03/08/worries-about-tech-and-the-chan-zuckerberg-30-million-support-of-reach-every-reader/|title=Worries about Tech and the Chan/Zuckerberg $30 Million Support of “Reach Every Reader”|date=8 March 2018|website=Nancy Bailey's Education Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school is largely technology based, utilizing a service, Canvas, from [[Instructure]] to assign and turn in schoolwork. Each student is assigned an [[iPad]] based on their grade level, and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] laptops are available for services not available on the iPad. Each student start classes on the college campus in eleventh grade if they pass an enrollment test, called the PERT, and have at least a 3.0 GPA. After completing the program, they are given an [[Associate degree]] at graduation, alongside their high school diploma. Following this, for a two-year period, students can be given a tuition-paid scholarship for the [[Florida Gulf Coast University]]. The current headmaster is Kelly Monod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCFCS Principal Change|url=http://www.scf.edu/Administration/AdministrativeDepartments/PublicAffairsMarketing/NewsReleases/2010/20101101_01.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brain Bowl==

Many SCF Collegiate Students regularly participate on the college Brain Bowl team, often with great success. SCF Collegiate Students Carlyle Styer and Christopher Medrano were a part of the "SCF Fire Team" which won the 2015 [[Brain Bowl|FCSAA Brain Bowl State Championship]]. Carlyle Styer was joined by fellow SCFCS student Kara Stevens, as well as four other SCF students in winning the 2015 [[NAQT]] Community College Championship. It is believed that this may be the only instance in which high school students have played a significant role in a [[quiz bowl]] national championship at the collegiate level.

'''Freethought''' (or "free thought")&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"/&gt; is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[point of view (philosophy)|viewpoint]] which holds that positions regarding [[truth]] should be formed on the basis of [[logic]], [[reason]], and [[empiricism]], rather than [[authority]], [[tradition]], [[revelation]], or [[dogma]]. According to the Oxford English Dictionary &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com&lt;/ref&gt;, a freethinker is 'a person who forms their own ideas and opinions rather than accepting those of other people, especially in religious teaching.' In some contemporary thought in particular, freethought is strongly tied with rejection of traditional social or religious belief systems.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/freethinker|title=Freethinker – Definition of freethinker by Merriam-Webster|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iheu.org/glossary/12#letterf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117115830/http://www.iheu.org/glossary/12#letterf |archivedate=2013-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cognitive]] application of freethought is known as "freethinking", and practitioners of freethought are known as "freethinkers".&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"/&gt;  Modern freethinkers consider freethought as a natural freedom of all negative and illusive thoughts acquired from the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffrf.org/nontracts/freethinker.php |title=Nontracts |publisher= |accessdate=12 June 2015 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120804135530/http://www.ffrf.org/nontracts/freethinker.php |archivedate=4 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term first came into use in the 17th century in order to indicate people who inquired into the basis of traditional religious beliefs. In practice, freethinking is most closely linked with [[secularism]], [[atheism]], [[agnosticism]], [[anti-clericalism]], and [[criticism of religion|religious critique]]. The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines freethinking as, "The free exercise of reason in matters of religious belief, unrestrained by deference to authority; the adoption of the principles of a free-thinker." Freethinkers hold that knowledge should be grounded in facts, [[scientific method|scientific inquiry,]] and logic.

Atheist author Adam Lee defines freethought as thinking which is independent of revelation, tradition, established belief, and [[argument from authority|authority]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/daylightatheism/2010/02/what-is-freethought/|title=What Is Freethought?|work=Daylight Atheism|accessdate=12 June 2015|date=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and considers it as a "broader umbrella" than atheism "that embraces a rainbow of unorthodoxy, religious dissent, skepticism, and unconventional thinking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/daylight-atheism/9-great-freethinkers-and-religious-dissenters-in-history|title=9 Great Freethinkers and Religious Dissenters in History|author=Adam Lee|work=Big Think|accessdate=12 June 2015|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic summarizing statement of the essay ''The Ethics of Belief'' by the 19th-century British mathematician and philosopher [[William Kingdon Clifford]] is: "It is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence."&lt;ref&gt;William Kingdon Clifford, ''The Ethics of Belief'' (1879 [1877]).&lt;/ref&gt; The essay became a rallying cry for freethinkers when published in the 1870s, and has been described as a point when freethinkers grabbed the moral high ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Becker |first=Lawrence and Charlotte |date=2013 |title=Encyclopedia of Ethics (article on "agnosticism") |url= |location= |publisher=Routledge |page=44 |isbn=9781135350963 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clifford was himself an organizer of freethought gatherings, the driving force behind the Congress of Liberal Thinkers held in 1878.

Regarding [[religion]], freethinkers typically hold that there is insufficient evidence to support the existence of [[supernatural]] phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hastings|first=James|title=Encyclopedia of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAwwaxdKMNAC|isbn=9780766136830|date=2003-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Freedom from Religion Foundation]], "No one can be a freethinker who demands conformity to a bible, [[creed]], or [[messiah]]. To the freethinker, revelation and faith are invalid, and orthodoxy is no guarantee of truth." and "Freethinkers are convinced that religious claims have not withstood the tests of reason. Not only is there nothing to be gained by believing an untruth, but there is everything to lose when we sacrifice the indispensable tool of reason on the altar of superstition. Most freethinkers consider religion to be not only untrue, but harmful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ffrf.org/faq/feeds/item/18391-what-is-a-freethinker|title=What is a Freethinker?  - Freedom From Religion Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote the following in his 1944 essay "The Value of Free Thought:"
{{Quote |text=What makes a freethinker is not his beliefs but the way in which he holds them. If he holds them because his elders told him they were true when he was young, or if he holds them because if he did not he would be unhappy, his thought is not free; but if he holds them because, after careful thought he finds a balance of evidence in their favour, then his thought is free, however odd his conclusions may seem. |author=Bertrand Russell |title=The Value of Free Thought. How to Become a Truth-Seeker and Break the Chains of Mental Slavery |source=from the first paragraph}}
The whole first paragraph of the essay makes it clear that a freethinker is not necessarily an atheist or an agnostic, as long as he or she satisfies this definition:
{{Quote |text=The person who is free in any respect is free ''from'' something; what is the free thinker free from? To be worthy of the name, he must be free of two things: the force of tradition, and the tyranny of his own passions. No one is ''completely'' free from either, but in the measure of a man's emancipation he deserves to be called a free thinker. |author=Bertrand Russell |title=The Value of Free Thought. How to Become a Truth-Seeker and Break the Chains of Mental Slavery |source=from the first paragraph}}

[[Fred Edwords]], former executive of the [[American Humanist Association]], suggests that by Russell's definition, [[liberal religion]]ists who have challenged established orthodoxies can be considered freethinkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://americanhumanist.org/humanism/Saga_of_Freethought_and_Its_Pioneers |title=Saga Of Freethought And Its Pioneers |work=American Humanist Association |accessdate=12 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715023327/http://americanhumanist.org/humanism/Saga_of_Freethought_and_Its_Pioneers |archivedate=15 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, according to Bertrand Russell, atheists and/or agnostics are not necessarily freethinkers. As an example, he mentions [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], whom he compares to a "[[pope]]":
{{Quote |text=what I am concerned with is the doctrine of the modern Communistic Party, and of the Russian Government to which it owes allegiance. According to this doctrine, the world develops on the lines of a Plan called [[Dialectical Materialism]], first discovered by [[Karl Marx]], embodied in the practice of a great state by [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], and now expounded from day to day by a Church of which Stalin is the Pope. […] Free discussion is to be prevented wherever the power to do so exists; […] If this doctrine and this organization prevail, free inquiry will become as impossible as it was in the middle ages, and the world will relapse into bigotry and obscurantism. |author=Bertrand Russell |title=The Value of Free Thought. How to Become a Truth-Seeker and Break the Chains of Mental Slavery}}

In the 18th and 19th century, many thinkers regarded as freethinkers were [[deists]], arguing that [[Outline of Christian theology|the nature of God]] can only be known from a study of nature rather than from religious revelation. In the 18th century, "deism" was as much of a 'dirty word' as "atheism", and deists were often stigmatized as either atheists or at least as freethinkers by their Christian opponents.&lt;ref&gt;James E. Force, Introduction (1990) to An Account of the Growth of Deism in England (1696) by William Stephens&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04679b.htm |title=Deism |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |editor-first=Francis |editor-last=Aveling |year=1908 |quote=The deists were what nowadays would be called freethinkers, a name, indeed, by which they were not infrequently known; and they can only be classed together wholly in the main attitude that they adopted, viz. in agreeing to cast off the trammels of authoritative religious teaching in favour of a free and purely rationalistic speculation.... Deism, in its every manifestation was opposed to the current and traditional teaching of revealed religion. |accessdate=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deists today regard themselves as freethinkers, but are now arguably less prominent in the freethought movement than atheists.

==Characteristics==
Among freethinkers, for a notion to be considered true it must be testable, [[Verifiability (science)|verifiable]], parsimonious, and logical. Many freethinkers tend to be [[humanism|humanists]], where they basing [[morality]] on human needs and would find [[meaning of life|meaning]] in human [[compassion]], [[social progress]], art, personal happiness, love, and the furtherance of [[knowledge]]. Generally, freethinkers like to think for themselves, tend to be skeptical, respect [[critical thinking]] and reason, remain open to new concepts, and are sometimes proud of their own [[individuality]]. They would determine truth for themselves – based upon knowledge they gain, answers they receive, experiences they have and the balance they thus acquire. Freethinkers reject [[conformity]] for the sake of conformity, whereby they create their own beliefs by considering the way the world around them works and would possess the intellectual integrity and courage to think outside of accepted [[Social norm|norms]], which may or may not lead them to believe in some [[deity|higher power]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fabians.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ACommonPlace.pdf A COMMON PLACE by Ruth Kelly and Liam Byrne]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Symbol==
[[Image:Fiołek ogrodowy wisnia6522.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[pansy]], a symbol of freethought.]]
The [[pansy]] serves as the long-established and enduring symbol of freethought; literature of the [[American Secular Union]] inaugurated its usage in the late 1800s. The reasoning behind the pansy as the symbol of freethought lies both in the flower's name and in its appearance. The pansy derives its name from the [[French language|French]] word ''pensée'', which means "thought".  It allegedly received this name because the flower is perceived by some to bear resemblance to a human face, and in mid-to-late summer it nods forward as if deep in thought.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120523184444/http://www.ffrf.org/fttoday/1997/june_july97/gaylor.html A Pansy For Your Thoughts, by Annie Laurie Gaylor, Freethought Today, June/July 1997&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]
&lt;/ref&gt; ''Challenging Religious Dogma: A History of Free Thought'', a pamphlet dating from the 1880s had this statement under the title "The Pansy Badge":&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leicestersecularsociety.org.uk/PHP_redirected/pansy.php The Pansy of Freethought - Rediscovering A Forgotten Symbol Of Freethought] by Annie Laurie Gaylor&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;There is . . . need of a [[badge]] which shall express at first glance, without complexity of detail, that basic principle of [[freedom of thought]] for which [[Liberalism|Liberal]]s of all isms are contending. This need seems to have been met by the Freethinkers of France, Belgium, Spain and Sweden, who have adopted the pansy as their badge. We join with them in recommending this flower as a simple and inexpensive badge of Freethought...Let every [[patriotism|patriot]] who is a Freethinker in this sense, adopt the pansy as his badge, to be worn at all times, as a silent and unobtrusive testimony of his principles. In this way we shall recognize our brethren in the cause, and the enthusiasm will spread; until, before long, the uplifted standard of the pansy, beneath the sheltering folds of the [[United States flag]], shall everywhere thrill men's hearts as the symbol of religious liberty and freedom of conscience."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==

===Pre-modern movement===
Critical thought has flourished in the Hellenistic Mediterranean, in the repositories of knowledge and wisdom in [[Ireland]] and in the [[Iran]]ian civilizations (for example in the era of [[Omar Khayyám|Khayyam]] (1048–1131) and his unorthodox [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|''Rubaiyat'']] poems), and in other civilizations, such as the Chinese (note for example the seafaring renaissance of the [[Liu_Song_dynasty|Southern Song]] dynasty of 420–479),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Song/song.html Chinese History – Song Dynasty 宋 (www.chinaknowledge.de)]&lt;/ref&gt; and on through [[Heresy|heretical]] thinkers on esoteric [[alchemy]] or [[astrology]], to the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]].

French physician and writer [[François Rabelais|Rabelais]] celebrated "rabelaisian" freedom as well as good feasting and drinking (an expression and a symbol of freedom of the mind) in defiance of the hypocrisies of [[conformist]] [[orthodoxy]] in his [[utopian]] [[Thelema#Fran.C3.A7ois Rabelais|Thelema]] Abbey (from θέλημα: free "will"), the device of which was ''Do What Thou Wilt'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;So had Gargantua established it. In all their rule and strictest tie of their order there was but this one clause to be observed, Do What Thou Wilt; because free people ... act virtuously and avoid vice. They call this honor.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When Rabelais's hero [[Gargantua and Pantagruel|Pantagruel]] journeys to the "Oracle of The Div(in)e Bottle", he learns the lesson of life in one simple word: ''"Trinch!"'', Drink! Enjoy the simple life, learn wisdom and knowledge, as a free human. Beyond puns, irony, and satire, Gargantua's prologue-[[metaphor]] instructs the reader to "break the bone and suck out the substance-full marrow" ("''la substantifique moëlle''"), the core of wisdom.

===Modern movements===
[[File:Freethought.JPG|170px|thumb|Freethought logo]]
The year 1600 is considered a landmark in the era of modern freethought. It was the year of the execution in Italy of [[Giordano Bruno]], a former [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar, by the [[Inquisition]].&lt;ref name=gatti18&gt;{{cite book|last=Gatti|first=Hilary|title=Giordano Bruno and Renaissance Science: Broken Lives and Organizational Power|date=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, New York|pages=18–19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cYumhwTQP8C|accessdate=21 March 2014|quote=For Bruno was claiming for the philosopher a principle of free thought and inquiry which implied an entirely new concept of authority: that of the individual intellect in its serious and continuing pursuit of an autonomous inquiry… It is impossible to understand the issue involved and to evaluate justly the stand made by Bruno with his life without appreciating the question of free thought and liberty of expression. His insistence on placing this issue at the center of both his work and of his defense is why Bruno remains so much a figure of the modern world. If there is, as many have argued, an intrinsic link between science and liberty of inquiry, then Bruno was among those who guaranteed the future of the newly emerging sciences, as well as claiming in wider terms a general principle of free thought and expression.|isbn=978-0801487859}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=montano1&gt;{{cite book|last=Montano|first=Aniello|title=Le deposizioni davanti al tribunale dell'Inquisizione|date=24 November 2007|publisher=La Città del Sole|location=Napoli|page=71|editor=Antonio Gargano|quote=In Rome, Bruno was imprisoned for seven years and subjected to a difficult trial that analyzed, minutely, all his philosophical ideas. Bruno, who in Venice had been willing to recant some theses, become increasingly resolute and declared on 21 December 1599 that he 'did not wish to repent of having too little to repent, and in fact did not know what to repent.' Declared an unrepentant heretic and excommunicated, he was burned alive in the Campo dei Fiori in Rome on 17 February 1600. On the stake, along with Bruno, burned the hopes of many, including philosophers and scientists of good faith like Galileo, who thought they could reconcile religious faith and scientific research, while belonging to an ecclesiastical organization declaring itself to be the custodian of absolute truth and maintaining a cultural militancy requiring continual commitment and suspicion.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=birx&gt;{{cite news|last=Birx|first=James|title=Giordano Bruno|url=http://www.theharbinger.org/xvi/971111/birx.html|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Mobile Alabama Harbinger|date=11 November 1997|quote=To me, Bruno is the supreme martyr for both free thought and critical inquiry… Bruno's critical writings, which pointed out the hypocrisy and bigotry within the Church, along with his tempestuous personality and undisciplined behavior, easily made him a victim of the religious and philosophical intolerance of the 16th century. Bruno was excommunicated by the Catholic, Lutheran and Calvinist Churches for his heretical beliefs. The Catholic hierarchy found him guilty of infidelity and many errors, as well as serious crimes of heresy… Bruno was burned to death at the stake for his pantheistic stance and cosmic perspective.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====England====
The term ''free-thinker'' emerged towards the end of the 17th century in England to describe those who stood in opposition to the institution of the [[Church of England|Church]], and the literal belief in the [[Bible]]. The beliefs of these individuals were centered on the concept that people could understand the world through consideration of nature. Such positions were formally documented for the first time in 1697 by [[William Molyneux]] in a widely publicized letter to [[John Locke]], and more extensively in 1713, when [[Anthony Collins]] wrote his ''Discourse of Free-thinking,'' which gained substantial popularity. This essay attacks the clergy of all churches and it is a plea for [[deism]].

''[[The Freethinker (journal)|The Freethinker]]'' magazine was first published in Britain in 1881.

====France====
In France, the concept first appeared in publication in 1765 when [[Denis Diderot]], [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], and [[Voltaire]] included an article on ''Liberté de penser'' in their [[Encyclopédie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artflsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.8:1431:4.encyclopedie0513.4781541|title=ARTFL Encyclopédie Search Results|volume=9|pages=472|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015|date=1751-1772}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European freethought concepts spread so widely that even places as remote as the [[Jotunheimen]], in [[Norway]], had well-known freethinkers such as [[Jo Gjende]] by the 19th century.&lt;ref name="MEMIM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gjendesheim|url=http://memim.com/gjendesheim.html|website=MEMIM|accessdate=8 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808194917/http://memim.com/gjendesheim.html|archivedate=8 August 2016|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[François-Jean de la Barre|François-Jean Lefebvre de la Barre]] (1745–1766) was a young [[France|French]] nobleman, famous for having been [[torture]]d and [[Decapitated|beheaded]] before his body was burnt on a [[pyre]] along with Voltaire's ''[[Philosophical Dictionary]]''.  La Barre is often said to have been executed for not saluting a [[Roman Catholic]] religious procession, but the elements of the case were far more complex.&lt;ref name="Gregory2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gregory|first1=Mary Efrosini|title=Evolutionism in Eighteenth-century French Thought|date=2008|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9781433103735|page=192|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&amp;linkCode=qs&amp;keywords=9781433103735|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, Lefebvre de la Barre is widely regarded a symbol of the victims of Christian [[religious intolerance]]; La Barre along with [[Jean Calas]] and [[Pierre-Paul Sirven]], was championed by Voltaire. A second replacement statue to de la Barre stands nearby the [[Sacré-Cœur, Paris|Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Jesus of Paris]] at the summit of the butte [[Montmartre]] (itself named from the ''Temple of Mars''), the highest point in [[Paris]] and an [[18th arrondissement of Paris|18th arrondissement]] street nearby the [[Sacré-Cœur, Paris|Sacré-Cœur]] is also named after Lefebvre de la Barre.

====Germany====
In Germany, during the period 1815–1848 and before the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution]], the resistance of citizens against the dogma of the church increased. In 1844, under the influence of [[Johannes Ronge]] and [[Robert Blum]], belief in the [[Rights of Man|rights of man]], tolerance among men, and [[humanism]] grew, and by 1859 they had established the ''Bund Freireligiöser Gemeinden Deutschlands'' (literally ''Union of Free Religious Communities of Germany''), an association of persons who consider themselves to be religious without adhering to any established and institutionalized church or sacerdotal cult. This union still exists today, and is included as a member in the umbrella organization of free humanists. In 1881 in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Ludwig Büchner]] established the ''Deutscher Freidenkerbund'' ([[German Freethinkers League]]) as the first German organization for [[Atheism|atheists]] and agnostics. In 1892 the ''Freidenker-Gesellschaft'' and in 1906 the ''Deutscher Monistenbund'' were formed.&lt;ref name="may"&gt;{{cite book |last= Bock| first= Heike | chapter= Secularization of the modern conduct of life?

Freethought organizations developed the "[[Jugendweihe]]" (literally ''Youth consecration''), a secular "[[confirmation]]" ceremony, and atheist funeral rites.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-472-06938-1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Reese, Dagmar |title=Growing up female in Nazi Germany |publisher=University of Michigan Press |location=Ann Arbor, Mich |year=2006 |page=160 |isbn=978-0-472-06938-5 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5qA4My-C2nkC&amp;pg=PA160 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Union of Freethinkers for Cremation was founded in 1905, and the Central Union of German Proletariat Freethinker in 1908. The two groups merged in 1927, becoming the German Freethinking Association in 1930.&lt;ref name="Reinhalter"&gt;{{cite book |last= Reinhalter|first=Helmut| editors=Bromiley, Geoffrey William; Fahlbusch, Erwin |chapter= Freethinkers|title=The encyclopedia of Christianity |publisher=Wm.

More "bourgeois" organizations declined after [[World War I]], and "proletarian" Freethought groups proliferated, becoming an organization of socialist parties.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaiser/&gt; European socialist freethought groups formed the International of Proletarian Freethinkers (IPF) in 1925.&lt;ref name="peris"/&gt; Activists agitated for Germans to disaffiliate from their respective Church and for seculari-zation of elementary schools; between 1919–21 and 1930–32 more than 2.5 million Germans, for the most part supporters of the Social Democratic and Communist parties, gave up church membership.&lt;ref name="lamberti"&gt;{{cite book |author=Lamberti, Marjorie |title=Politics Of Education: Teachers and School Reform in Weimar Germany (Monographs in German History) |publisher=Berghahn Books |location=Providence |year=2004 |page= 185|isbn=978-1-57181-299-5 |oclc= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jbmwM4wsMKEC&amp;pg=PA185|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conflict developed between radical forces including the Soviet [[League of the Militant Godless]] and Social Democratic forces in Western Europe led by Theodor Hartwig and [[Max Sievers]].&lt;ref name="peris"&gt;{{cite book |author=Peris, Daniel |title=Storming the heavens: the Soviet League of the Militant Godless |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, N.Y |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-8014-3485-3 |pages=110–11 |doi= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nC2LSv5QNYkC&amp;pg=PA110}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930 the Soviet and allied delegations, following a walk-out, took over the IPF and excluded the former leaders.&lt;ref name="peris"/&gt;
Following Hitler's rise to power in 1933, most freethought organizations were banned, though some right-wing groups that worked with so-called ''[[Völkisch]]e Bünde'' (literally ''"ethnic" associations'' with nationalist, xenophobic and very often racist ideology) were tolerated by the Nazis until the mid-1930s.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaiser&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaiser|first=Jochen-Christoph|title=Atheismus und religiöse Indifferenz|editor=Christel Gärtner|publisher=VS Verlag|year=2003|volume=Organisierter Atheismus|isbn=978-3-8100-3639-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YXOr4xQFSJsC&amp;pg=PA124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belgium====
{{Main|Organized secularism}}
The [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]] and the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]], along with the two Circles of Free Inquiry (Dutch and French speaking), defend the freedom of critical thought, [[Laity|lay]] philosophy and [[ethics]], while rejecting the [[Appeal to authority|argument of authority]].

====Netherlands====
In the Netherlands, freethought has existed in organized form since the establishment of De Dageraad (now known as [[De Vrije Gedachte]]) in 1856. Among its most notable subscribing 19th century individuals were Johannes van Vloten, [[Multatuli]], Adriaan Gerhard and [[Domela Nieuwenhuis]].

In 2009, Frans van Dongen established the Atheist-Secular Party, which takes a considerably restrictive view of religion and public religious expressions.

Since the 19th century, Freethought in the Netherlands has become more well known as a political phenomenon through at least three currents: liberal freethinking, conservative freethinking, and classical freethinking. In other words, parties which identify as freethinking tend to favor non-doctrinal, rational approaches to their preferred ideologies, and arose as secular alternatives to both clerically aligned parties as well as labor-aligned parties. Common themes among freethinking political parties are "freedom", "liberty", and "[[individualism]]".

==== Switzerland ====
{{Main|Freethinkers Association of Switzerland}}
With the introduction of cantonal [[church tax]]es in the 1870s, [[anti-clericalism|anti-clericals]] began to organise themselves. Around 1870, a "freethinkers club" was founded in [[Zürich]]. During the debate on the Zürich church law in 1883, professor Friedrich Salomon Vögelin and city council member Kunz proposed to [[separation of church and state|separate church and state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.frei-denken.ch/de/2008/04/geschichte-der-freidenker/ |title=Geschichte der Freidenker |work=FAS website |accessdate=10 May 2016 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
The Free Thought movement first organized itself in the United States as the "Free Press Association" in 1827 in defense of George Houston, publisher of ''The Correspondent'', an early journal of [[Biblical criticism]] in an era when blasphemy convictions were still possible.  Houston had helped found an [[Owenite]] community at Haverstraw, New York in 1826–27.  The short-lived ''Correspondent'' was superseded by the ''Free Enquirer'', the official organ of [[Robert Owen]]'s [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] community in Indiana, edited by [[Robert Dale Owen]] and by [[Fanny Wright]] between 1828 and 1832 in New York.  During this time Robert Dale Owen sought to introduce the philosophic skepticism of the Free Thought movement into the [[Working Men's Party (New York)|Workingmen's Party]] in New York City.  The ''Free Enquirer'''s annual civic celebrations of Paine's birthday after 1825 finally coalesced in 1836 in the first national Free Thinkers organization, the "United States Moral and Philosophical Society for the General Diffusion of Useful Knowledge".  It was founded on August 1, 1836, at a national convention at the Lyceum in Saratoga Springs with Isaac S. Smith of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], New York, as president.  Smith was also the 1836 [[Equal Rights Party (United States)|Equal Rights Party]]'s candidate for Governor of New York and had also been the Workingmen's Party candidate for Lt. Governor of New York in 1830.  The Moral and Philosophical Society published ''The Beacon'', edited by Gilbert Vale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Hugins|first= Walter|title= Jacksonian Democracy and the Working Class: A Study of the New York Workingmen's Movement 1829–1837|year= 1960|publisher= Stanford University Press|location= Stanford|pages= 36–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Driven by the revolutions of 1848 in the German states, the 19th century saw an [[immigration]] of [[German people|German]] freethinkers and anti-clericalists to the United States (see [[Forty-Eighters]]).  In the United States, they hoped to be able to live by their principles, without interference from government and church authorities.&lt;ref name="Freethinkers in Wisconsin"&gt;

Many Freethinkers settled in German immigrant strongholds, including [[St. Louis]], [[Indianapolis]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Texas]], where they founded the town of [[Comfort, Texas|Comfort]], Texas, as well as others.&lt;ref name="Freethinkers in Wisconsin"/&gt;

These groups of German Freethinkers referred to their organizations as ''Freie Gemeinden'', or "free congregations".&lt;ref name="Freethinkers in Wisconsin"/&gt; The first Freie Gemeinde was established in St. Louis in 1850.&lt;ref name="American Irreligion 1966"&gt;Demerath, N. J. III and Victor Thiessen, "On Spitting Against the Wind: Organizational Precariousness and American Irreligion," ''The American Journal of Sociology'', 71: 6 (May, 1966), 674–87.&lt;/ref&gt; Others followed in Pennsylvania, California, Washington, D.C., New York, Illinois, Wisconsin, Texas, and other states.&lt;ref name="Freethinkers in Wisconsin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="American Irreligion 1966"/&gt;

Freethinkers tended to be liberal, espousing ideals such as racial, social, and sexual equality, and the abolition of slavery.&lt;ref name="Freethinkers in Wisconsin"/&gt;

The "Golden Age of Freethought" in the US came in the late 1800s.  The dominant organization was the [[National Liberal League (United States)|National Liberal League]] which formed in 1876 in Philadelphia. This group re-formed itself in 1885 as the American Secular Union under the leadership of the eminent agnostic orator [[Robert G. Ingersoll]]. Following Ingersoll's death in 1899 the organization declined, in part due to lack of effective [[leadership]].&lt;ref name=ftt&gt;{{cite web|title= National Liberal League|url= http://www.freethought-trail.org/profile.php?By=Person&amp;Page=30|work= The Freethought Trail|publisher= freethought-trail.org|accessdate= 9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freethought in the United States declined in the early twentieth century. Its anti-religious views alienated would-be sympathizers.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The movement also lacked cohesive goals or beliefs. By the early twentieth century, most Freethought congregations had disbanded or joined other mainstream churches. The longest continuously operating Freethought congregation in America is the Free Congregation of Sauk County, Wisconsin, which was founded in 1852 and is still active {{as of | 2016 | lc = on}}. It affiliated with the [[American Unitarian Association]] (now the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]) in 1955.&lt;ref name="Sauk County Freethinkers"&gt;{{cite web | title = History of the Free Congregation of Sauk County: The "Freethinkers" Story | publisher = Free Congregation of Sauk County | date = April 2009 | url = http://www.freecongregation.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=52&amp;Itemid=59 | accessdate = 2012-02-05 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120326214734/http://www.freecongregation.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=52&amp;Itemid=59 | archivedate = 2012-03-26 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[D.

====Canada====
In 1873 a handful of secularists founded the earliest known secular organization in [[English Canada]], the Toronto Freethought Association. Reorganized in 1877 and again in 1881, when it was renamed the Toronto Secular Society, the group formed the nucleus of the Canadian Secular Union, established in 1884 to bring together freethinkers from across the country.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ramsay Cook]], ''The Regenerators: Social Criticism in Late Victorian English Canada'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1985), pp. 46–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant number of the early members appear to have come from the educated labour "aristocracy", including Alfred F. Jury, J. Ick Evans and J. I. Livingstone, all of whom were leading labour activists and secularists. The second president of the Toronto association, [[T. Phillips Thompson]], became a central figure in the city's labour and social-reform movements during the 1880s and 1890s and arguably Canada's foremost late nineteenth-century labour intellectual. By the early 1880s scattered freethought organizations operated throughout southern [[Ontario]] and parts of [[Quebec]], eliciting both urban and rural support.

The principal organ of the freethought movement in Canada was ''[[Secular Thought]]'' (Toronto, 1887–1911). Founded and edited during its first several years by English freethinker [[Charles Watts (secularist) |Charles Watts]] (1835–1906), it came under the editorship of Toronto printer and publisher James Spencer Ellis in 1891 when Watts returned to England. In 1968 the [[Humanist Association of Canada]] (HAC) formed to serve as an umbrella group for humanists, atheists, and freethinkers, and to champion social justice issues and oppose religious influence on public policy—most notably in the fight to make access to abortion free and legal in Canada.

====Anarchism====
{{Anarchism sidebar |Theory}}
In the United States, "freethought was a basically [[Anti-Christianity|anti-christian]], [[anti-clerical]] movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of ''Freethought'' and, for a time, ''The Truth Seeker.'' E.C. Walker was co-editor of the freethought/free love journal ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]''."&lt;ref name="mises.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/journals/jls/5_3/5_3_4.pdf|title=The Journal of Libertarian Studies|work=Mises Institute|accessdate=12 June 2015|date=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]'', ''Freethought'' and ''The Truth Seeker'' appeared in ''Liberty''...The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself."&lt;ref name="mises.org"/&gt;

In Europe, a similar development occurred in French and Spanish individualist anarchist circles. "Anticlericalism, just as in the rest of the libertarian movement, in another of the frequent elements which will gain relevance related to the measure in which the (French) Republic begins to have conflicts with the church...Anti-clerical discourse, frequently called for by the French individualist [[André Lorulot]], will have its impacts in ''Estudios'' (a Spanish individualist anarchist publication). There will be an attack on institutionalized religion for the responsibility that it had in the past on negative developments, for its irrationality which makes it a counterpoint of philosophical and scientific progress. There will be a criticism of proselitism and ideological manipulation which happens on both believers and agnostics".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120324044614/http://www.viruseditorial.net/pdf/anarquismo%20individualista.pdf Xavier Diez. ''El anarquismo individualista en España (1923–1939)'' Virus Editorial. 2007. p. 143]&lt;/ref&gt; These tendencies will continue in French individualist anarchism in the work and activism of [[Charles-Auguste Bontemps]] and others. In the Spanish individualist anarchist magazines ''Ética'' and ''[[Iniciales]]'' "there is a strong interest in publishing scientific news, usually linked to a certain atheist and [[anti-theist]] obsession, philosophy which will also work for pointing out the incompatibility between science and religion, faith, and reason. In this way there will be a lot of talk on Darwin´s theories or on the negation of the existence of the soul".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120324044614/http://www.viruseditorial.net/pdf/anarquismo%20individualista.pdf Xavier Diez. ''El anarquismo individualista en España (1923–1939)'' Virus Editorial. 2007. p. 152]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, Catalan anarchist and freethinker [[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]] established "modern" or [[Progressive education|progressive schools]] in [[Barcelona]] in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="Fidler"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Geoffrey C. Fidler |date=Spring–Summer 1985 |title=The Escuela Moderna Movement of Francisco Ferrer: "Por la Verdad y la Justicia" |journal=History of Education Quarterly |volume=25 |issue=1/2 |pages=103–32 |id= |doi=10.2307/368893 |jstor=368893 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The schools' stated goal was to "[[Popular education|educate the working class]] in a rational, secular and non-coercive setting". Fiercely anti-clerical, Ferrer believed in "freedom in education", education free from the authority of church and state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/ferrer.html |title=Francisco Ferrer's Modern School |publisher=Flag.blackened.net |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807032003/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/ferrer.html |archivedate=2010-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrer's ideas, generally, formed the inspiration for a series of [[Modern School (United States)|Modern Schools]] in the United States,&lt;ref name="Fidler"/&gt; [[Cuba]], [[South America]] and [[London]]. The first of these was started in [[New York City]] in 1911. It also inspired the Italian newspaper ''[[Università popolare (Italian newspaper)|Università popolare]]'', founded in 1901.&lt;ref name="Fidler"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9211">{{short description|Comparison and judgement of performance of a skill with the specified criteria for competence}}
Competence assessment is a process in which evidence is gathered by the assessor and evaluated against agreed criteria in order to make a judgement of competence. '''Skill assessment''' is the comparison of actual performance of a skill with the specified standard for performance of that skill under the circumstances specified by the standard, and evaluation of whether the performance meets or exceed the requirements. Assessment of a skill should comply with the four principles of validity, reliability, fairness and flexibility.

Formative assessment provides feedback for remedial work and coaching, while summative assessment checks whether the competence has been achieved at the end of training. Assessment of combinations of skills and of foundational knowledge may provide greater efficiency, and in some cases competence in one skill my imply competence in other skills. The thoroughness reqired of assessment may depend on the consequences of occasional poor performance.

==Principles of assessment==
===Validity===
Validity is the primary requirement. If the assessment is not valid, then the other characteristics are irrelevant. Validity means that an assessment process effectively assesses what it is claimed and intended to assess. To achieve this the assessment tools must address all requirements of the standard to the appropriate depth (neither too much nor too little) and be repeated often enough to ensure that the required performance is repeatable.&lt;ref name="Validity" /&gt;

The training standard that specifies the competency is the benchmark for assessment, and to be valid the assessment must comply exactly with its requirements, so that nothing required by the standard is omitted, and nothing that is not required is included.&lt;ref name="Validity" /&gt;

The assessment tools for a skill therefore need to be designed so that they allow the skill to be tested in compliance with the requirements of the standard. It can be useful to map the assessment tools to the specific competences to ensure that they cover the full scope of the standard.&lt;ref name="Validity" /&gt;

There may be a requirement for periodical validation of assessment tools. This process generally involves mapping the tools against the standard and checking that the tools comply with the other principles of assessment and the rules of evidence.&lt;ref name="Validity" /&gt;

===Reliability===
After validity, reliability is essential. A reliable assessment is one where the evidence elicited and interpretation of evidence is consistent with the skill required, so that the assessment consistently produces outcomes that are compliant with the standard. The assessment decision of a given observed performance should not vary for different assessors. The same evidence should lead to the same outcome.&lt;ref name="Reliability" /&gt;

To achieve this, the assessment tool must provide sufficient guidance for the assessor. In practice the assessment instrument provided to the candidate should be paired with an assessor guide which provides instructions to the assessor to guide their judgement of satisfactory performance or acceptable answers to questions.&lt;ref name="Reliability" /&gt;

===Fairness===
To be fair the assessment process must be clearly understood by the candidates, and there must be agreement by both assessors and candidates that candidates’ reasonable needs circumstances are addressed.&lt;ref name="Fairness" /&gt;

The assessment tool can provide evidence that the process is understood and accepted by the candidate, by having a place where a statement to this effect is signed by the candidate at the start of the assessment. A further statement that the assessor has checked with the candidate for any special circumstances or requirements can also be included. Reasonable adjustment must not compromise the validity or reliability of the assessment.&lt;ref name="Fairness" /&gt;

===Flexibility===
Flexibility of assessment is desirable where reasonably practicable. This is a feature that should be inherent in the assessment tools for the skill, and should take into account the expected variability of circumstances, including variations in candidates, equipment, location, environmental conditions and other things not entirely under the control of the assessor, but within the scope of the competence requirements. Flexibility does not imply bending the rules, or failing to comply with the specifications of the standards. All performance criteria must be addressed.&lt;ref name="Flexibility" /&gt;

==Types of assessment==
{{main|Types of assessment}}
Formative assessments are formal and informal tests, tasks, quizzes, discussions or observations taken during the learning process. These assessments identify strengths and weaknesses and provide feedback to modify the consequent learning activities to facilitate efficient learning and skill development.

Summative assessments evaluate skills at or after the end of an instructional unit, to ensure that competence has been achieved. At this point remedial work may no longer be practicable.

Integrated assessment is part of the learning and teaching process, and can take place at various stages of a learning programme. Assessments may combine assessment of theory and practice. Some skills may need separate and specific assessment, but others can be combined for efficiency.&lt;ref name="Integrated assessment" /&gt;

Assessment is not an event that only occurs at the end of training, it is most effective when continuous and when providing constant feedback on progress and problems, allowing timely intervention where useful. In many cases a sample of evidence is sufficient to infer competence over a fairly large range, as competence in a skill that requires competence in other skills may be a proxy for those more foundational skills.&lt;ref name="Integrated assessment" /&gt;

Comprehensive planning is usually necessary to produce robust assessment tools that suit the training programme and do justice to both the training standard and the learners.&lt;ref name="Integrated assessment" /&gt;

==Assessment methods==
Assessment of practical skills is usually best done by direct observation of performance in conditions as close as reasonably practicable to  the circumstances in which the skill would normally be practiced. Where this is not reasonably practicable, simulations may be appropriate, to whatever level of accuracy is available. Assessment of realistic combinations of skills may save a lot of time, and scenarios may be devised that allow simultaneous and sequential assessments of several skill in one assessment session.

The number of repetitions required will also depend on how critical the skill is considered to be. A single successful demonstration may be sufficient to show that the candidate can perform a task when the consequences are minor. Several sequential faultless performances may be required if another person's life will depend on correct performance.

==Assessment tools==
[[Assessment tool]]s for practical skills may describe a task to be done, and the assessors guide should generally list the stages of the task and the details the assessor should check off as they are done. Where order is important, this should be mentioned. A checklist may be provided as permanent record, or a video may be taken. In some cases there will be a product which can be retained as long term evidence along with the paperwork or database records.

Peacejam Ghana started in 2008 by its official chapter, the West Africa Center for Peace Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wacpfgh.org/|title=West African Center for Peace Foundation|website=wacpfgh.org|access-date=2019-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghana (WACPF). Peacejam [[Ghana]] has mentored and trained over 5000 students since its inception. Peacejam Ghana has produced many scholars, some of whom have received the TPG Global Impact Youth Fellows&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://u.emzingo.com/global-impact-fellowship/|title=GLOBAL IMPACT FELLOWSHIP|website=EMZINGO|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; scholarship to pursue higher degrees.

Wisdom Addo is the Founder and Executive Director of the West Africa Center for Peace Foundation, Ghana.

'''Logic''' (from the {{lang-grc|[[wikt:λογική|λογική]]|logikḗ}}&lt;ref name="argumentative"/&gt;), is the systematic study of the [[Logical form|form]] of [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[inference]], and the most general laws of [[truth]].&lt;ref&gt;Due to Frege, see the [[Definitions of logic]] article.&lt;/ref&gt; A valid inference is one where there is a specific relation of logical support between the assumptions of the inference and its [[consequent|conclusion]]. In ordinary discourse, inferences may be signified by words such as ''therefore'', ''hence'', ''ergo'', and so on.

There is no universal agreement as to the exact scope and subject matter of logic (see {{section link||Rival conceptions}}, below), but it has traditionally included the classification of arguments, the systematic exposition of the 'logical form' common to all valid arguments, the study of proof and [[inference]], including [[paradox]]es and [[fallacies]], and the study of [[syntax]] and [[semantics]].  Historically, logic has been studied in [[philosophy]] (since ancient times) and [[mathematics]] (since the mid-19th century), and recently logic has been studied in [[computer science]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]], and other fields.

==Concepts==
{{rquote|right|Upon this first, and in one sense this sole, rule of reason, that in order to learn you must desire to learn, and in so desiring not be satisfied with what you already incline to capably think, there follows one corollary which itself deserves to be inscribed upon every wall of the city of philosophy: Do not block the way of inquiry.|[[Charles Sanders Peirce]], "First Rule of Logic"}}
The concept of [[logical form]] is central to logic. The validity of an argument is determined by its logical form, not by its content. Traditional [[syllogism|Aristotelian syllogistic logic]] and modern symbolic logic are examples of formal logic.
* '''[[Informal logic]]''' is the study of [[natural language]] [[Logical argument|arguments]]. The study of [[fallacies]] is an important branch of informal logic. Since much informal argument is not strictly speaking deductive, on some conceptions of logic, informal logic is not logic at all.  See 'Rival conceptions', below.
* '''[[Mathematical formalism|Formal logic]]''' is the study of [[inference]] with purely formal content. An inference possesses a ''purely formal content'' if it can be expressed as a particular application of a wholly abstract rule, that is, a rule that is not about any particular thing or property. The works of [[Aristotle]] contain the earliest known formal study of logic. Modern formal logic follows and expands on Aristotle.&lt;ref name="The Basic Works"/&gt; In many definitions of logic, [[logical consequence|logical inference]] and inference with purely formal content are the same. This does not render the notion of informal logic vacuous, because no formal logic captures all of the nuances of natural language.
* '''[[Mathematical logic#Symbolic logic|Symbolic logic]]''' is the study of symbolic abstractions that capture the formal features of logical inference.&lt;ref name="Principia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt; Symbolic logic is often divided into two main branches: [[propositional logic]] and [[predicate logic]].
* '''[[Mathematical logic]]''' is an extension of symbolic logic into other areas, in particular to the study of [[model theory]], [[proof theory]], [[set theory]], and [[recursion theory]].

However, agreement on what logic is has remained elusive, and although the field of [[universal logic]] has studied the common structure of logics, in 2007 Mossakowski et al. commented that "it is embarrassing that there is no widely acceptable formal definition of 'a logic'".&lt;ref&gt;T. Mossakowski, [[Joseph Goguen|J. A. Goguen]], R. Diaconescu, A. Tarlecki, "What is a Logic?", [[Logica Universalis]] 2007 Birkhauser,  pp. 113–133.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logical form===
{{main article|Logical form}}
Logic is generally considered '''formal''' when it analyzes and represents the ''form'' of any valid argument type. The form of an argument is displayed by representing its sentences in the formal grammar and symbolism of a logical language to make its content usable in formal inference. Simply put, to formalize simply means to translate English sentences into the language of logic.

This is called showing the ''logical form'' of the argument. It is necessary because indicative sentences of ordinary language show a considerable variety of form and complexity that makes their use in inference impractical. It requires, first, ignoring those grammatical features irrelevant to logic (such as gender and declension, if the argument is in Latin), replacing conjunctions irrelevant to logic (such as "but") with [[logical conjunction]]s like "and" and replacing ambiguous, or alternative logical expressions ("any", "every", etc.) with expressions of a standard type (such as "all", or the [[universal quantifier]] ∀).

Second, certain parts of the sentence must be replaced with schematic letters. Thus, for example, the expression "all Ps are Qs" shows the logical form common to the sentences "all men are mortals", "all cats are carnivores", "all Greeks are philosophers", and so on.  The schema can further be condensed into the [[formula]] ''A(P,Q)'', where the letter ''A'' indicates the judgement 'all - are -'.

The importance of form was recognised from ancient times. Aristotle uses variable letters to represent valid inferences in ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', leading [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] to say that the introduction of variables was "one of Aristotle's greatest inventions".&lt;ref name="Aristotle's syllogistic from the standpoint of modern formal logic"/&gt; According to the followers of Aristotle (such as [[Ammonius Saccas|Ammonius]]), only the logical principles stated in schematic terms belong to logic, not those given in concrete terms. The concrete terms "man", "mortal", etc., are analogous to the substitution values of the schematic placeholders ''P'', ''Q'', ''R'', which were called the "matter" (Greek ''hyle'') of the inference.

There is a big difference between the kinds of formulas seen in traditional term logic and the [[predicate calculus]] that is the fundamental advance of modern logic.  The formula ''A(P,Q)'' (all Ps are Qs) of traditional logic corresponds to the more complex formula &lt;math&gt;\forall x (P(x) \rightarrow Q(x))&lt;/math&gt; in predicate logic, involving the logical connectives for [[universal quantification]] and [[material conditional|implication]] rather than just the predicate letter ''A'' and using variable arguments &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; where traditional logic uses just the term letter ''P''.  With the complexity comes power, and the advent of the predicate calculus inaugurated revolutionary growth of the subject.

=== Semantics ===
{{main article|Semantics of logic}}

The validity of an argument depends upon the meaning or ''semantics'' of the sentences that make it up.

Aristotle's [[Organon]], especially ''[[On Interpretation]]'', gives a cursory outline of semantics which the [[scholastic logic]]ians, particularly in the thirteenth and fourteenth century, developed into a complex and sophisticated theory, called [[Supposition Theory]].  This showed how the truth of simple sentences, expressed schematically, depend on how the terms 'supposit' or ''stand for'' certain extra-linguistic items.  For example, in part II of his [[Sum of Logic|Summa Logicae]], [[William of Ockham]] presents a comprehensive account of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the truth of simple sentences, in order to show which arguments are valid and which are not.  Thus "every A is B' is true if and only if there is something for which 'A' stands, and there is nothing for which 'A' stands, for which 'B' does not also stand." &lt;ref&gt;''Summa Logicae'' Part II c.4 transl. as ''Ockam's Theory of Propositions'', A. Freddoso and H. Schuurman, St Augustine's Press 1998, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Early modern logic defined semantics purely as a relation between ideas.  [[Antoine Arnauld]] in the [[Port Royal Logic]], says that 'after conceiving things by our ideas, we compare these ideas, and, finding that some belong together and some do not, we unite or separate them. This is called ''affirming'' or ''denying'', and in general ''judging''.&lt;ref&gt;Arnauld, ''Logic or the Art of Thinking'' Part 2 Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus truth and falsity are no more than the agreement or disagreement of ideas.  This suggests obvious difficulties, leading [[John Locke|Locke]] to distinguish between 'real' truth, when our ideas have 'real existence' and 'imaginary' or 'verbal' truth, where ideas like harpies or centaurs exist only in the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, 1690.  [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]], IV. v. 1–8)&lt;/ref&gt;  This view ([[psychologism]]) was taken to the extreme in the nineteenth century, and is generally held by modern logicians to signify a low point in the decline of logic before the twentieth century.

Modern semantics is in some ways closer to the medieval view, in rejecting such psychological truth-conditions.  However, the introduction of [[quantifier (logic)|quantification]], needed to solve the [[problem of multiple generality]], rendered impossible the kind of subject-predicate analysis that underlies medieval semantics.  The main modern approach is ''model-theoretic semantics'', based on [[Alfred Tarski]]'s [[semantic theory of truth]].  The approach assumes that the meaning of the various parts of the propositions are given by the possible ways we can give a recursively specified group of [[interpretation function]]s from them to some predefined [[domain of discourse]]: an interpretation of [[first-order predicate logic]] is given by a mapping from terms to a universe of [[individual]]s, and a mapping from propositions to the truth values "true" and "false".  Model-theoretic semantics is one of the fundamental concepts of [[model theory]].  Modern semantics also admits rival approaches, such as the [[proof-theoretic semantics]] that associates the meaning of propositions with the roles that they can play in inferences, an approach that ultimately derives from the work of [[Gerhard Gentzen]] on [[structural proof theory]] and is heavily influenced by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s later philosophy, especially his aphorism "meaning is use".

===Inference===
''Inference'' is not to be confused with ''implication''.  An implication is a sentence of the form 'If p then q', and can be true or false.  [[Stoic logic|The Stoic logician]] [[Philo the Dialectician|Philo of Megara]] was the first to define the truth conditions of such an implication: false only when the antecedent p is true and the consequent q is false, in all other cases true.  An inference, on the other hand, consists of two separately asserted propositions of the form 'p therefore q'.  An inference is not true or false, but valid or invalid.  However, there is a connection between implication and inference, as follows: if the implication 'if p then q' is ''true'', the inference 'p therefore q' is ''valid''.  This was given an apparently paradoxical formulation by Philo, who said that the implication 'if it is day, it is night' is true only at night, so the inference 'it is day, therefore it is night' is valid in the night, but not in the day.

The theory of inference (or 'consequences') was systematically developed in medieval times by logicians such as [[William of Ockham]] and [[Walter Burley]].  It is uniquely medieval, though it has its origins in Aristotle's [[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]] and [[Boethius]]' ''De Syllogismis hypotheticis''.  This is why many terms in logic are Latin.  For example, the rule that licenses the move from the implication 'if p then q' plus the assertion of its antecedent p, to the assertion of the consequent q is known as [[modus ponens]] (or 'mode of positing').  Its Latin formulation is 'Posito antecedente ponitur consequens'.  The Latin formulations of many other rules such as 'ex falso quodlibet' (anything follows from a falsehood), 'reductio ad absurdum' (disproof by showing the consequence is absurd) also date from this period.

However, the theory of consequences, or of the so-called '[[hypothetical syllogism]]' was never fully integrated into the theory of the 'categorical syllogism'.  This was partly because of the resistance to reducing the categorical judgment 'Every S is P' to the so-called hypothetical judgment 'if anything is S, it is P'.  The first was thought to imply 'some S is P', the second was not, and as late as 1911 in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] article on Logic, we find the Oxford logician T.H. Case arguing against Sigwart's and Brentano's modern analysis of the universal proposition.

===Logical systems===
{{main article|Formal system}}
A formal system is an organization of terms used for the analysis of deduction. It consists of an alphabet, a language over the alphabet to construct sentences, and a rule for deriving sentences. Among the important properties that [[logical system]]s can have are:
* '''[[Consistency proof|Consistency]]''', which means that no theorem of the system contradicts another.&lt;ref name="Bergmann, Merrie 2009"/&gt;
* '''[[Validity (logic)|Validity]]''', which means that the system's rules of proof never allow a false inference from true premises.
* '''[[completeness (logic)|Completeness]]''', which means that if a formula is true, it can be proven, i.e. is a ''theorem'' of the system.
* '''[[Soundness]]''', meaning that if any formula is a theorem of the system, it is true. This is the converse of completeness. (Note that in a distinct philosophical use of the term, an argument is sound  when it is both valid and its premises are true).&lt;ref&gt;''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', [http://www.iep.utm.edu/val-snd/ Validity and Soundness]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Expressive power (computer science)|Expressivity]]''', meaning what concepts can be expressed in the system.

Some logical systems do not have all four properties. As an example, [[Kurt Gödel]]'s [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorems]] show that sufficiently complex formal systems of arithmetic cannot be consistent and complete;&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt; however, first-order predicate logics not extended by specific [[axiom]]s to be arithmetic formal systems with equality can be complete and consistent.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Mathematical Logic"/&gt;

===Logic and rationality===
{{main article|Logic and rationality}}
{{confusing|section|date=May 2016}}
As the study of argument is of clear importance to the reasons that we hold things to be true, logic is of essential importance to [[rationality]].  Here we have defined logic to be "the systematic study of the form of arguments"; the reasoning behind argument is of several sorts, but only some of these arguments fall under the aegis of logic proper.

[[Deductive reasoning]] concerns the [[logical consequence]] of given premises and is the form of reasoning most closely connected to logic. On a narrow conception of logic (see below) logic concerns just deductive reasoning, although such a narrow conception controversially excludes most of what is called informal logic from the discipline.

There are other forms of reasoning that are rational but that are generally not taken to be part of logic.  These include [[inductive reasoning]], which covers forms of inference that move from collections of particular judgements to universal judgements, and [[abductive reasoning]],&lt;ref name=abduction&gt;On [[abductive reasoning]], see:
* Magnani, L. ''Abduction, Reason, and Science: Processes of Discovery and Explanation''. Kluwer Academic Plenum Publishers, New York, 2001. xvii. 205 pages. Hardcover, {{isbn|0-306-46514-0}}.
* R. Josephson, J. &amp; G. Josephson, S. ''Abductive Inference: Computation, Philosophy, Technology''. Cambridge University Press, New York &amp; Cambridge. viii. 306 pages. Hardcover (1994), {{isbn|0-521-43461-0}}, Paperback (1996), {{isbn|0-521-57545-1}}.
* Bunt, H. &amp; Black, W. ''Abduction, Belief and Context in Dialogue: Studies in Computational Pragmatics''. (Natural Language Processing, 1.) John Benjamins, Amsterdam &amp; Philadelphia, 2000. vi. 471 pages. Hardcover, {{isbn|90-272-4983-0|1-55619-794-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a form of inference that goes from observation to a hypothesis that accounts for the reliable data (observation) and seeks to explain relevant evidence. The American philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914) first introduced the term as "guessing".&lt;ref name=guess&gt;See [http://www.commens.org/dictionary/term/abduction Abduction] and [http://www.commens.org/dictionary/term/retroduction Retroduction] at ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms'', and see Peirce's papers:
* "On the Logic of drawing History from Ancient Documents especially from Testimonies" (1901), ''Collected Papers'' v. 7, paragraph 219.
* "PAP" ["Prolegomena to an Apology for Pragmatism"], MS 293 c. 1906, ''New Elements of Mathematics'' v. 4, pp. 319–320.
* A Letter to F.A. Woods (1913), ''Collected Papers'' v. 8, paragraphs 385–388.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce said that to ''abduce'' a hypothetical explanation &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; from an observed surprising circumstance &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is to surmise that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; may be true because then &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; would be a matter of course.&lt;ref name=HL&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1903), Harvard lectures on pragmatism, ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, [http://www.textlog.de/7664-2.html paragraphs 188–189].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, to abduce &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; involves determining that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is [[necessary and sufficient conditions|sufficient (or nearly sufficient), but not necessary]], for &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.

While inductive and abductive inference are not part of logic proper, the methodology of logic has been applied to them with some degree of success.  For example, the notion of deductive validity (where an inference is deductively valid [[if and only if]] there is no possible situation in which all the premises are true but the conclusion false) exists in an analogy to the notion of inductive validity, or "strength", where an inference is inductively strong if and only if its premises give some degree of probability to its conclusion.  Whereas the notion of deductive validity can be rigorously stated for systems of formal logic in terms of the well-understood notions of [[semantics]], inductive validity requires us to define a reliable generalization of some set of observations. The task of providing this definition may be approached in various ways, some less formal than others; some of these definitions may use logical association [[rule induction]], while others may use [[mathematical model]]s of probability such as [[decision tree]]s.

===Rival conceptions===
{{Main article|Rival conceptions of logic}}
Logic arose (see below) from a concern with correctness of [[argumentation]]. Modern logicians usually wish to ensure that logic studies just those arguments that arise from appropriately general forms of inference. For example, Thomas Hofweber writes in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' that logic "does not, however, cover good reasoning as a whole. That is the job of the theory of [[rationality]]. Rather it deals with inferences whose validity can be traced back to the formal features of the representations that are involved in that inference, be they linguistic, mental, or other representations."&lt;ref name="stanford-logic-onthology"/&gt;

Logic has been defined{{by whom|date=September 2016}} as "the study of arguments correct in virtue of their form".  This has not been the definition taken in this article, but the idea that logic treats special forms of argument, deductive argument, rather than argument in general, has a history in logic that dates back at least to [[logicism]] in mathematics (19th and 20th centuries) and the advent of the influence of mathematical logic on philosophy.  A consequence of taking logic to treat special kinds of argument is that it leads to identification of special kinds of truth, the logical truths (with logic equivalently being the study of logical truth), and excludes many of the original objects of study of logic that are treated as informal logic.  [[Robert Brandom]] has argued against the idea that logic is the study of a special kind of logical truth, arguing that instead one can talk of the logic of [[material inference]] (in the terminology of [[Wilfred Sellars]]), with logic making explicit the commitments that were originally implicit in informal inference.&lt;ref name="brandom-2000" /&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}}

==History==
{{Main article|History of logic}}
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Aristotle]], 384–322&amp;nbsp;BCE.]]
Logic comes from the Greek word ''logos'', originally meaning "the word" or "what is spoken", but coming to mean "thought" or "reason". In the Western World, logic was first developed by [[Aristotle]], who called the subject 'analytics'.&lt;ref name="achievement"/&gt; [[Aristotelian logic]] became widely accepted in science and mathematics and remained in wide use in the West until the early 19th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name="mtu"/&gt; Aristotle's system of logic was responsible for the introduction of [[hypothetical syllogism]],&lt;ref name="google"/&gt; [[Temporal logic|temporal]] [[modal logic]],&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt; and [[Inductive reasoning|inductive logic]],&lt;ref name="google3"/&gt; as well as influential vocabulary such as [[terminology|terms]], [[predicables]], [[syllogisms]] and [[proposition]]s. There was also the rival [[Stoic logic]].

In [[Europe]] during the later medieval period, major efforts were made to show that Aristotle's ideas were compatible with [[Christianity|Christian]] faith. During the [[High Middle Ages]], logic became a main focus of philosophers, who would engage in critical logical analyses of philosophical arguments, often using variations of the methodology of [[scholasticism]]. In 1323, [[William of Ockham]]'s influential ''[[Sum of Logic|Summa Logicae]]'' was released. By the 18th century, the structured approach to arguments had degenerated and fallen out of favour, as depicted in [[Ludvig Holberg|Holberg]]'s satirical play ''[[Erasmus Montanus]]''.
The [[Logic in China|Chinese logical]] philosopher [[Gongsun Long]] ({{nowrap|c. 325–250 BCE}}) proposed the paradox "One and one cannot become two, since neither becomes two."&lt;ref name="propositions"/&gt; In China, the tradition of scholarly investigation into logic, however, was repressed by the [[Qin dynasty]] following the legalist philosophy of [[Han Feizi]].

In India, the [[Anviksiki]] school of logic was founded by [[Indian logic|Medhatithi Gautama]] (c. 6th century BCE).&lt;ref&gt;S.C. Vidyabhusana (1971). ''A History of Indian Logic: Ancient, Mediaeval, and Modern Schools'', pp. 17–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Innovations in the scholastic school, called [[Nyaya]], continued from ancient times into the early 18th&amp;nbsp;century with the [[Navya-Nyaya]] school. By the 16th&amp;nbsp;century, it developed theories resembling modern logic, such as [[Gottlob Frege]]'s "distinction between sense and reference of proper names" and his "definition of number", as well as the theory of "restrictive conditions for universals" anticipating some of the developments in modern [[set theory]].&lt;ref name="Chakrabarti"/&gt; Since 1824, Indian logic attracted the attention of many Western scholars, and has had an influence on important 19th-century logicians such as [[Charles Babbage]], [[Augustus De Morgan]], and [[George Boole]].&lt;ref name="Indian logic: a reader"/&gt; In the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, Western philosophers like Stanislaw Schayer and Klaus Glashoff have explored Indian logic more extensively.

The [[Syllogism|syllogistic]] logic developed by Aristotle predominated in the West until the mid-19th&amp;nbsp;century, when interest in the [[foundations of mathematics]] stimulated the development of symbolic logic (now called [[mathematical logic]]). In 1854, George Boole published ''[[The Laws of Thought|An Investigation of the Laws of Thought on Which are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities]]'', introducing symbolic logic and the principles of what is now known as [[Boolean logic]]. In 1879, Gottlob Frege published ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'', which inaugurated modern logic with the invention of [[Quantification (logic)|quantifier]] notation, reconciling the Aristotelian and Stoic logics in a broader system, and solving such problems for which Aristotelian logic was impotent, such as the [[problem of multiple generality]].. From 1910 to 1913, [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] published ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''&lt;ref name="Principia"/&gt; on the foundations of mathematics, attempting to derive mathematical truths from [[axiom]]s and [[inference rule]]s in symbolic logic. In 1931, [[Gödel]] raised serious problems with the foundationalist program and logic ceased to focus on such issues.

The development of logic since Frege, Russell, and [[Wittgenstein]] had a profound influence on the practice of philosophy and the perceived nature of philosophical problems (see [[analytic philosophy]]) and [[philosophy of mathematics]]. Logic, especially sentential logic, is implemented in computer [[Digital electronics|logic circuits]] and is fundamental to [[computer science]]. Logic is commonly taught by university philosophy departments, often as a compulsory discipline.

===Syllogistic logic===
{{main article|Aristotelian logic}}
[[File:Johannesmagistris-square.jpg|thumb|A depiction from the 15th century of the [[square of opposition]], which expresses the fundamental dualities of syllogistic.]]

The ''[[Organon]]'' was [[Aristotle]]'s body of work on logic, with the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'' constituting the first explicit work in formal logic, introducing the syllogistic.&lt;ref name="Aristotle"/&gt; The parts of syllogistic logic, also known by the name [[term logic]], are the analysis of the judgements into propositions consisting of two terms that are related by one of a fixed number of relations, and the expression of inferences by means of [[syllogism]]s that consist of two propositions sharing a common term as premise, and a conclusion that is a proposition involving the two unrelated terms from the premises.

Aristotle's work was regarded in classical times and from medieval times in Europe and the Middle East as the very picture of a fully worked out system. However, it was not alone: the [[Stoics]] proposed a system of [[propositional logic]] that was studied by medieval logicians. Also, the [[problem of multiple generality]] was recognized in medieval times. Nonetheless, problems with syllogistic logic were not seen as being in need of revolutionary solutions.

Today, some academics claim that Aristotle's system is generally seen as having little more than historical value (though there is some current interest in extending term logics), regarded as made obsolete by the advent of propositional logic and the [[predicate calculus]]. Others use Aristotle in [[argumentation theory]] to help develop and critically question argumentation schemes that are used in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[legal]] arguments.

===Propositional logic===
{{main article|Propositional calculus}}
A propositional calculus or logic (also a sentential calculus) is a formal system in which formulae representing propositions can be formed by combining [[atomic propositions]] using [[logical connectives]], and in which a system of formal proof rules establishes certain formulae as "theorems".  An example of a theorem of propositional logic is &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;, which says that if A holds, then B implies A.

===Predicate logic===
[[File:BS-12-Begriffsschrift Quantifier1-svg.svg|thumb|[[Gottlob Frege]]'s ''[[Begriffschrift]]'' introduced the notion of quantifier in a graphical notation, which here represents the judgement that &lt;math&gt;\forall x. F(x)&lt;/math&gt; is true.]]
{{main article|Predicate logic}}
Predicate logic is the generic term for symbolic formal systems such as [[first-order logic]], [[second-order logic]], [[many-sorted logic]], and [[infinitary logic]].  It provides an account of [[Quantifiers (logic)|quantifiers]] general enough to express a wide set of arguments occurring in natural language.   For example, [[Bertrand Russell]]'s famous [[barber paradox]], "there is a man who shaves all and only men who do not shave themselves" can be formalised by the sentence &lt;math&gt;(\exists x ) (\text{man}(x) \wedge (\forall y) (\text{man}(y) \rightarrow (\text{shaves}(x, y)  \leftrightarrow \neg \text{shaves}(y, y))))&lt;/math&gt;, using the non-logical predicate &lt;math&gt;\text{man}(x)&lt;/math&gt; to indicate that ''x'' is a man, and the non-logical relation &lt;math&gt;\text{shaves}(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; to indicate that ''x'' shaves ''y''; all other symbols of the formulae are logical, expressing the universal and existential [[quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]], [[logical conjunction|conjunction]], [[Material conditional|implication]], [[negation]] and [[biconditional]].

Whilst Aristotelian syllogistic logic specifies a small number of forms that the relevant part of the involved judgements may take, predicate logic allows sentences to be analysed into subject and argument in several additional ways—allowing predicate logic to solve the [[problem of multiple generality]] that had perplexed medieval logicians.

The development of predicate logic is usually attributed to [[Gottlob Frege]], who is also credited as one of the founders of [[analytical philosophy]], but the formulation of predicate logic most often used today is the first-order logic presented in [[Principles of Mathematical Logic]] by [[David Hilbert]] and [[Wilhelm Ackermann]] in 1928. The analytical generality of predicate logic allowed the formalization of mathematics, drove the investigation of [[set theory]], and allowed the development of [[Alfred Tarski]]'s approach to [[model theory]]. It provides the foundation of modern [[mathematical logic]].

Frege's original system of predicate logic was second-order, rather than first-order. [[Second-order logic]] is most prominently defended (against the criticism of [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] and others) by [[George Boolos]] and [[Stewart Shapiro]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Modal logic===
{{main article|Modal logic}}
In languages, [[Linguistic modality|modality]] deals with the phenomenon that sub-parts of a sentence may have their semantics modified by special verbs or modal particles. For example, "''We go to the games''" can be modified to give "''We should go to the games''", and "''We can go to the games''" and perhaps "''We will go to the games''". More abstractly, we might say that modality affects the circumstances in which we take an assertion to be satisfied. Confusing modality is known as the [[modal fallacy]].

[[Aristotle]]'s logic is in large parts concerned with the theory of non-modalized logic. Although, there are passages in his work, such as the famous [[problem of future contingents|sea-battle argument]] in ''[[De Interpretatione]]'' § 9, that are now seen as anticipations of modal logic and its connection with [[potentiality]] and time, the earliest formal system of modal logic was developed by [[Avicenna]], who ultimately developed a theory of "[[Temporal logic|temporally]] [[Modal logic|modalized]]" syllogistic.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-65928 |title=History of logic: Arabic logic |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the study of necessity and possibility remained important to philosophers, little logical innovation happened until the landmark investigations of [[Clarence Irving Lewis]] in 1918, who formulated a family of rival axiomatizations of the alethic modalities. His work unleashed a torrent of new work on the topic, expanding the kinds of modality treated to include [[deontic logic]] and [[epistemic logic]].  The seminal work of [[Arthur Prior]] applied the same formal language to treat [[temporal logic]] and paved the way for the marriage of the two subjects. [[Saul Kripke]] discovered (contemporaneously with rivals) his theory of [[Kripke semantics|frame semantics]], which revolutionized the formal technology available to modal logicians and gave a new [[graph theory|graph-theoretic]] way of looking at modality that has driven many applications in [[computational linguistics]] and [[computer science]], such as [[dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]].

===Informal reasoning and dialectic===
{{main article|Informal logic|Logic and dialectic}}
The motivation for the study of logic in ancient times was clear: it is so that one may learn to distinguish good arguments from bad arguments, and so become more effective in argument and oratory, and perhaps also to become a better person. Half of the works of Aristotle's [[Organon]] treat inference as it occurs in an informal setting, side by side with the development of the syllogistic, and in the Aristotelian school, these informal works on logic were seen as complementary to Aristotle's treatment of [[rhetoric]].

This ancient motivation is still alive, although it no longer takes centre stage in the picture of logic; typically [[dialectic]]al logic forms the heart of a course in [[critical thinking]], a compulsory course at many universities.  Dialectic has been linked to logic since ancient times, but it has not been until recent decades that European and American logicians have attempted to provide mathematical foundations for logic and dialectic by formalising dialectical logic. [[Dialectical logic]] is also the name given to the special treatment of dialectic in [[Hegel]]ian and [[Marx]]ist thought.  There have been pre-formal treatises on argument and dialectic, from authors such as [[Stephen Toulmin]] (''The Uses of Argument''), [[Nicholas Rescher]] (''Dialectics''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rescher|first=Nicholas|title=Dialectics: A Controversy-Oriented Approach to the Theory of Knowledge|url=http://ojs.uwindsor.ca/ojs/leddy/index.php/informal_logic/article/view/2809|date=1978|journal=Informal Logic|volume=1|issue=#3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hetherington|first=Stephen|title=Nicholas Rescher: Philosophical Dialectics|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/25075-philosophical-dialectics-an-essay-on-metaphilosophy/|date=2006|journal=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews|issue=2006.07.16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Jacquette, Dale|last=Rescher|first=Nicholas|title=Reason, Method, and Value: A Reader on the Philosophy of Nicholas Rescher|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T65moyMMioYC|date=2009|publisher=Ontos Verlag|isbn=978-3-11-032905-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and van Eemeren and Grootendorst ([[Pragma-dialectics]]).  Theories of [[defeasible reasoning]] can provide a foundation for the formalisation of dialectical logic and dialectic itself can be formalised as moves in a game, where an advocate for the truth of a proposition and an opponent argue.  Such games can provide a formal [[game semantics]] for many logics.

[[Argumentation theory]] is the study and research of informal logic, fallacies, and critical questions as they relate to every day and practical situations. Specific types of dialogue can be analyzed and questioned to reveal premises, conclusions, and fallacies. Argumentation theory is now applied in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[law]].

===Mathematical logic===
{{main article|Mathematical logic}}
Mathematical logic comprises two distinct areas of research: the first is the application of the techniques of formal logic to mathematics and mathematical reasoning, and the second, in the other direction, the application of mathematical techniques to the representation and analysis of formal logic.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Elementary Mathematical Logic"/&gt;

The earliest use of mathematics and [[geometry]] in relation to logic and philosophy goes back to the ancient Greeks such as [[Euclid]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle"/&gt; Many other ancient and medieval philosophers applied mathematical ideas and methods to their philosophical claims.&lt;ref name="Prior Analytics"/&gt;

One of the boldest attempts to apply logic to mathematics was the [[logicism]] pioneered by philosopher-logicians such as [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell]]. Mathematical theories were supposed to be logical [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], and the programme was to show this by means of a reduction of mathematics to logic.&lt;ref name="Principia"/&gt; The various attempts to carry this out met with failure, from the crippling of Frege's project in his ''Grundgesetze'' by [[Russell's paradox]], to the defeat of [[Hilbert's program]] by [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]]s.

Both the statement of Hilbert's program and its refutation by Gödel depended upon their work establishing the second area of mathematical logic, the application of mathematics to logic in the form of [[proof theory]].&lt;ref name="Introduction to Mathematical Logic5"/&gt; Despite the negative nature of the incompleteness theorems, [[Gödel's completeness theorem]], a result in [[model theory]] and another application of mathematics to logic, can be understood as showing how close logicism came to being true: every rigorously defined mathematical theory can be exactly captured by a first-order logical theory; Frege's [[proof calculus]] is enough to ''describe'' the whole of mathematics, though not ''equivalent'' to it.

If proof theory and model theory have been the foundation of mathematical logic, they have been but two of the four pillars of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Barwise (1982) divides the subject of mathematical logic into model theory, proof theory, set theory and recursion theory.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Set theory]] originated in the study of the infinite by [[Georg Cantor]], and it has been the source of many of the most challenging and important issues in mathematical logic, from [[Cantor's theorem]], through the status of the [[Axiom of Choice]] and the question of the independence of the [[continuum hypothesis]], to the modern debate on [[large cardinal]] axioms.

[[Recursion theory]] captures the idea of computation in logical and [[arithmetic]] terms; its most classical achievements are the undecidability of the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] by [[Alan Turing]], and his presentation of the [[Church–Turing thesis]].&lt;ref name="Theory of computation: formal languages, automata, and complexity"/&gt; Today recursion theory is mostly concerned with the more refined problem of [[complexity class]]es—when is a problem efficiently solvable?—and the classification of [[Turing degree|degrees of unsolvability]].&lt;ref name="Theory of computation: formal languages, automata, and complexity6"/&gt;

===Philosophical logic===
{{main article|Philosophical logic}}
[[Philosophical logic]] deals with formal descriptions of ordinary, non-specialist [[Natural language|("natural") language]], that is strictly only about the arguments within philosophy's other branches. Most philosophers assume that the bulk of everyday&lt;!--was: "normal" proper--&gt; reasoning can be captured in logic if a method or methods to translate ordinary language into that logic can be found. Philosophical logic is essentially a continuation of the traditional discipline called "logic" before the invention of mathematical logic. Philosophical logic has a much greater concern with the connection between natural language and logic. As a result, philosophical logicians have contributed a great deal to the development of non-standard logics (e.g. [[free logic]]s, [[tense logic]]s) as well as various extensions of [[classical logic]] (e.g. [[modal logic]]s) and non-standard semantics for such logics (e.g. [[Saul Kripke|Kripke]]'s [[supervaluationism]] in the semantics of logic).

Logic and the philosophy of language are closely related. Philosophy of language has to do with the study of how our language engages and interacts with our thinking. Logic has an immediate impact on other areas of study. Studying logic and the relationship between logic and ordinary speech can help a person better structure his own arguments and critique the arguments of others. Many popular arguments are filled with errors because so many people are untrained in logic and unaware of how to formulate an argument correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Epistemology and Cognition|first=Alvin I.|last=Goldman|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1986|isbn=978-0-674-25896-9|page=293|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9XwhBw2jMqMC&amp;pg=PA293|quote=untrained subjects are prone to commit various sorts of fallacies and mistakes}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Intelligence, Mind, and Reasoning: Structure and Development|volume=106|series=Advances in Psychology|editor1-first=A.|editor1-last=Demetriou|editor2-first=A.|editor2-last=Efklides|publisher=Elsevier|year=1994|isbn=978-0-08-086760-1|page=194|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HkukZOU2pzIC&amp;pg=PA194}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computational logic===
{{main article|Computational logic|Logic in computer science}}
[[File:Register transfer level - example toggler.svg|right|thumb|300px
|A simple toggling circuit is expressed using a logic gate and a synchronous register.]]
Logic cut to the heart of computer science as it emerged as a discipline: [[Alan Turing]]'s work on the ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' followed from [[Kurt Gödel]]'s work on the [[incompleteness theorems]]. The notion of the general purpose computer that came from this work was of fundamental importance to the designers of the computer machinery in the 1940s.

In the 1950s and 1960s, researchers predicted that when human knowledge could be expressed using logic with [[mathematical notation]], it would be possible to create a machine that reasons, or artificial intelligence. This was more difficult than expected because of the complexity of human reasoning. In [[logic programming]], a program consists of a set of axioms and rules. Logic programming systems such as [[Prolog]] compute the consequences of the axioms and rules in order to answer a query.

Today, logic is extensively applied in the fields of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[computer science]], and these fields provide a rich source of problems in formal and informal logic. [[Argumentation theory]] is one good example of how logic is being applied to artificial intelligence. The [[ACM Computing Classification System]] in particular regards:
* Section F.3 on [[Logics and meanings of programs]] and F.4 on [[Mathematical logic and formal languages]] as part of the theory of computer science: this work covers [[formal semantics of programming languages]], as well as work of [[formal methods]] such as [[Hoare logic]];
* [[Boolean logic]] as fundamental to computer hardware: particularly, the system's section B.2 on [[Arithmetic and logic structures]], relating to operatives [[logical conjunction|AND]], [[negation|NOT]], and [[logical disjunction|OR]];
* Many fundamental logical formalisms are essential to section I.2 on artificial intelligence, for example [[modal logic]] and [[default logic]] in [[Knowledge representation formalisms and methods]], [[Horn clause]]s in logic programming, and [[description logic]].

Furthermore, computers can be used as tools for logicians. For example, in symbolic logic and mathematical logic, proofs by humans can be computer-assisted. Using [[automated theorem proving]], the machines can find and check proofs, as well as work with proofs too lengthy to write out by hand.

===Non-classical logic===
{{Main article|Non-classical logic}}
The logics discussed above are all "[[Principle of bivalence|bivalent]]" or "two-valued"; that is, they are most naturally understood as dividing propositions into true and false propositions. [[Non-classical logic]]s are those systems that reject various rules of [[Classical logic]].

Hegel developed his own [[Hegelian dialectic|dialectic logic]] that extended [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s transcendental logic but also brought it back to ground by assuring us that "neither in heaven nor in earth, neither in the world of mind nor of nature, is there anywhere such an abstract 'either–or' as the understanding maintains. Whatever exists is concrete, with difference and opposition in itself".&lt;ref name="philosophical"/&gt;

In 1910, [[Nicolai A. Vasiliev]] extended the law of excluded middle and the law of contradiction and proposed the law of excluded fourth and logic tolerant to contradiction.&lt;ref name="Brenner2008"/&gt; In the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] investigated the extension of the traditional true/false values to include a third value, "possible", so inventing [[ternary logic]], the first [[multi-valued logic]] in the Western tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Logic For Dummies|first=Mark|last=Zegarelli|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2010|isbn=978-1-118-05307-2|page=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xm0-0Rs2GVoC&amp;pg=PA30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Logics such as [[fuzzy logic]] have since been devised with an infinite number of "degrees of truth", represented by a [[real number]] between 0 and 1.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt;

[[Intuitionistic logic]] was proposed by [[L.E.J. Brouwer]] as the correct logic for reasoning about mathematics, based upon his rejection of the [[law of the excluded middle]] as part of his [[intuitionism]]. Brouwer rejected formalization in mathematics, but his student [[Arend Heyting]] studied intuitionistic logic formally, as did [[Gerhard Gentzen]]. Intuitionistic logic is of great interest to computer scientists, as it is a [[constructive logic]] and sees many applications, such as extracting verified programs from proofs and influencing the design of [[programming language]]s through the [[formulae-as-types correspondence]].

[[Modal logic]] is not truth conditional, and so it has often been proposed as a non-classical logic. However, modal logic is normally formalized with the principle of the excluded middle, and its [[relational semantics]] is bivalent, so this inclusion is disputable.

==Controversies==
==="Is Logic Empirical?"===
{{details|Is Logic Empirical?}}
What is the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] status of the [[Classical logic|laws of logic]]? What sort of argument is appropriate for criticizing purported principles of logic? In an influential paper entitled "[[Is Logic Empirical?]]"&lt;ref name="Is Logic Empirical?"/&gt; [[Hilary Putnam]], building on a suggestion of [[W. V. Quine]], argued that in general the facts of propositional logic have a similar epistemological status as facts about the physical universe, for example as the laws of [[mechanics]] or of [[general relativity]], and in particular that what physicists have learned about quantum mechanics provides a compelling case for abandoning certain familiar principles of classical logic: if we want to be [[philosophical realism|realists]] about the physical phenomena described by quantum theory, then we should abandon the [[principle of distributivity]], substituting for classical logic the [[quantum logic]] proposed by [[Garrett Birkhoff]] and [[John von Neumann]].&lt;ref name="The Logic of Quantum Mechanics"/&gt;

Another paper of the same name by [[Michael Dummett]] argues that Putnam's desire for realism mandates the law of distributivity.&lt;ref name="Truth and Other Enigmas"/&gt; Distributivity of logic is essential for the realist's understanding of how propositions are true of the world in just the same way as he has argued the principle of bivalence is. In this way, the question, "Is Logic Empirical?" can be seen to lead naturally into the fundamental controversy in [[metaphysics]] on [[realism versus anti-realism]].

===Implication: Strict or material===
{{main article|Paradoxes of material implication}}
The notion of implication formalized in classical logic does not comfortably translate into natural language by means of "if&amp;nbsp;... then&amp;nbsp;...", due to a number of problems called the [[paradoxes of material implication]].

The first class of paradoxes involves counterfactuals, such as ''If the moon is made of green cheese, then 2+2=5'', which are puzzling because natural language does not support the [[principle of explosion]]. Eliminating this class of paradoxes was the reason for [[C.I. Lewis]]'s formulation of [[strict implication]], which eventually led to more radically revisionist logics such as [[relevance logic]].

The second class of paradoxes involves redundant premises, falsely suggesting that we know the succedent because of the antecedent: thus "if that man gets elected, granny will die" is materially true since granny is mortal, regardless of the man's election prospects. Such sentences violate the [[Gricean maxim]] of relevance, and can be modelled by logics that reject the principle of [[monotonicity of entailment]], such as relevance logic.

===Tolerating the impossible===
{{main article|Paraconsistent logic}}
[[Hegel]] was deeply critical of any simplified notion of the [[law of non-contradiction]]. It was based on [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]'s idea that this law of logic also requires a sufficient ground to specify from what point of view (or time) one says that something cannot contradict itself. A building, for example, both moves and does not move; the ground for the first is our solar system and for the second the earth. In Hegelian dialectic, the law of non-contradiction, of identity, itself relies upon difference and so is not independently assertable.

Closely related to questions arising from the paradoxes of implication comes the suggestion that logic ought to tolerate [[inconsistency]]. [[Relevance logic]] and [[paraconsistent logic]] are the most important approaches here, though the concerns are different: a key consequence of [[classical logic]] and some of its rivals, such as [[intuitionistic logic]], is that they respect the [[principle of explosion]], which means that the logic collapses if it is capable of deriving a contradiction. [[Graham Priest]], the main proponent of [[dialetheism]], has argued for paraconsistency on the grounds that there are in fact, true contradictions.&lt;ref name="stanford7"/&gt;{{clarify|this is a provocative statement that deserves an inline example or Wikipedia explanation of some sort|date=October 2016}}

===Rejection of logical truth===
The philosophical vein of various kinds of skepticism contains many kinds of doubt and rejection of the various bases on which logic rests, such as the idea of logical form, correct inference, or meaning, typically leading to the conclusion that there are no [[logical truth]]s. This is in contrast with the usual views in [[philosophical skepticism]], where logic directs skeptical enquiry to doubt received wisdoms, as in the work of [[Sextus Empiricus]].

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] provides a strong example of the rejection of the usual basis of logic: his radical rejection of idealization led him to reject truth as a "...&amp;nbsp;mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms—in short&amp;nbsp;... metaphors which are worn out and without sensuous power; coins which have lost their pictures and now matter only as metal, no longer as coins."&lt;ref name="nietzsche"/&gt; His rejection of truth did not lead him to reject the idea of either inference or logic completely, but rather suggested that "logic [came] into existence in man's head [out] of illogic, whose realm originally must have been immense. Innumerable beings who made inferences in a way different from ours perished".&lt;ref name="nietzsche8"/&gt; Thus there is the idea that logical inference has a use as a tool for human survival, but that its existence does not support the existence of truth, nor does it have a reality beyond the instrumental: "Logic, too, also rests on assumptions that do not correspond to anything in the real world".&lt;ref name="nietzsche9"/&gt;

This position held by Nietzsche however, has come under extreme scrutiny for several reasons. Some philosophers, such as [[Jürgen Habermas]], claim his position is self-refuting—and accuse Nietzsche of not even having a coherent perspective, let alone a theory of knowledge.&lt;ref name="nietzsche10"/&gt; [[Georg Lukács]], in his book ''The Destruction of Reason'', asserts that, "Were we to study Nietzsche's statements in this area from a logico-philosophical angle, we would be confronted by a dizzy chaos of the most lurid assertions, arbitrary and violently incompatible."&lt;ref name="marxists"/&gt; [[Bertrand Russell]] described Nietzsche's irrational claims with "He is fond of expressing himself paradoxically and with a view to shocking conventional readers" in his book ''A History of Western Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|title=A History of Western Philosophy And Its Connection with Political and Social Circumstances from the Earliest Times to the Present Day|year=1945|publisher=Simon and Schuster|url=http://www.ntslibrary.com/PDF%20Books/History%20of%20Western%20Philosophy.pdf/|page=762|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528221822/http://www.ntslibrary.com/PDF%20Books/History%20of%20Western%20Philosophy.pdf|archivedate=28 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''State College of Florida, Manatee-Sarasota''' (SCF) is a [[Community_colleges_in_the_United_States|state college]] with campuses located in [[Manatee County|Manatee]] and [[Sarasota County, Florida|Sarasota county]], [[Florida]]. Part of the [[Florida College System]], it is designated a "state college" because it offers a greater number of four-year [[bachelor's degree]]s than traditional two-year [[community college]]s.

Founded in 1957 as '''Manatee Junior College''', it was known as '''Manatee Community College''' from 1985 to 2009. Today SCF operates three campuses in [[Bradenton, Florida|Bradenton]], [[Lakewood Ranch, Florida|Lakewood Ranch]], and [[Venice, Florida|Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.scf.edu/AboutSCF/Locations/ |title= Locations, Maps &amp; Directions |date= 2013 |website= www.scf.edu |publisher= State College of Florida, Manatee–Sarasota |accessdate=June 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{Convert|100|acre|m2}} Bradenton campus includes the [[Family Heritage House Museum]], the [[State College of Florida Collegiate School|SCF Collegiate School]] (SCFCS), The Neel Performing Arts Center, and the SCF Dental Hygiene Clinic, which provides low cost dental care to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scf.edu/Academics/DentalHygiene/DentalClinic/default.asp|title=Dental Clinic - State College of Florida, Manatee-Sarasota|last=Manatee-Sarasota|first=State College of Florida,|website=www.scf.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

State College of Florida was established on September 17, 1957, by the [[Florida Board of Education]] as Manatee Junior College. The college came into existence under a plan of the [[Florida Board of Education]] to provide accessible higher education to Florida's population.&lt;ref name=facc&gt;[http://www.facc.org/facc/Community_College_History.asp?SnID=2 Florida Association of Community Colleges] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726045127/http://www.facc.org/facc/Community_College_History.asp?SnID=2 |date=2011-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first classes were held on September 2, 1958, in what was formerly a senior high school; enrollment in the first term was 502 students. The college began administering classes in its own facilities in 1959, where the 100 acre [[Bradenton]] campus stands today.

The Venice center was opened in 1977 by MJC's Board of Trustees. During this period, the center's functions were funded by the donations of residents living in the surrounding communities which included [[Venice, FL|Venice]], [[North Port, FL|North Port]], and [[Englewood, FL|Englewood]]. It was not until 1983 that the college received an appropriation from the Florida legislature to expand the Venice center into what is now the full-service Venice campus. It was dedicated on March 30, 1985 and the college's name was changed that year to Manatee Community College.

At the beginning of 2003, MCC opened the {{Convert|5|acres|m2}} Lakewood Ranch campus. The land appropriated for this was donated by the Schroeder-Manatee Ranch. The Lakewood Ranch campus offers credit and non-credit programs of study, as well as technical and workforce development courses. In 2007, the Schroeder-Manatee Ranch donated an additional {{convert|5|acre|m2}} to the Lakewood Ranch campus. MCC obtained supplementary funding from the Florida legislature, which was allocated for the construction of a new classroom/laboratory building.&lt;ref name=mccfl&gt;[http://www.scf.edu MCC Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, MCC received approval from the State Board of Education to offer baccalaureate degrees and changed its name to State College of Florida, Manatee-Sarasota to reflect its new status as a four year state institution. The first bachelor's degree offered at SCF was a Bachelor of Science in Nursing which started in January of 2010. Several other bachelor's degrees are now available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scf.edu/Academics/BaccalaureateDegrees/default.asp|title=Baccalaureate Programs - State College of Florida, Manatee-Sarasota|last=Manatee-Sarasota|first=State College of Florida,|website=www.scf.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campus ==
Students can attend classes on campuses located in [[Bradenton, Florida|Bradenton]], [[Venice, Florida|Venice]], and [[Lakewood Ranch]]. As well as many business and public-sector sites throughout the community, and from their homes via [[Elearning|online classes]]. On September 29th, 2017, State College of Florida purchased {{Convert|74|acres|m2}} of land to build a brand new campus in [[Parrish, Florida|Parrish]] that will provide high quality education to those living north of the [[Manatee River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scf.edu/Administration/PublicAffairsMarketing/NewsReleases/2017/1003_Parrish_Purchase.asp|title=SCF, Manatee-Sarasota Purchases 74 acres - Future Home of SCF Parrish - State College of Florida, Manatee-Sarasota|last=Manatee-Sarasota|first=State College of Florida,|website=www.scf.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Statua Iustitiae.jpg|thumb|170px|The [[Blind justice (concept)|concept of blind justice]] is a moral principle.&lt;ref&gt;Jacoby, Jeff.  [http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2009/05/10/lady_justices_blindfold/ "Lady Justice's blindfold."] ''Boston.com''.  10 May 2009.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A '''principle''' is a proposition or value that is a guide for behavior or evaluation. In [[law]], it is a [[Legal rule|rule]] that has to be or usually is to be followed, or can be desirably followed, or is an inevitable consequence of something, such as the laws observed in  nature or the way that a system is constructed. The principles of such a system are understood by its users as the essential characteristics of the system, or reflecting system's designed purpose, and the effective operation or use of which would be impossible if any one of the principles was to be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Alpa, Guido (1994) [http://digitalcommons.law.ggu.edu/annlsurvey/vol1/iss1/2/ General Principles of Law], ''Annual Survey of International &amp; Comparative Law'', Vol. 1: Is. 1, Article 2. from [[Golden Gate University School of Law]]&lt;/ref&gt; A system may be explicitly based on and implemented from a document of principles as was done in IBM's [[IBM System/360 architecture|360/370]] ''Principles of Operation''.

Examples of principles are, [[entropy (disambiguation)|entropy]] in a number of fields, [[least action]] in physics, those in descriptive comprehensive and fundamental law: [[doctrine]]s or assumptions forming  normative rules of conduct, [[separation of church and state]] in statecraft, the [[central dogma of molecular biology]], [[wikt:fairness|fairness]] in ethics, etc.

In common English, it is a substantive and collective term referring to rule governance, the absence of which, being "unprincipled", is considered a character defect. It may also be used to declare that a reality has diverged from some ideal or norm as when something is said to be true only "in principle" but not in fact.

A principle represents values that orient and rule the conduct of persons in a particular society.  To "act on principle" is to act in accordance with one's moral ideals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/politics/jeff-flake-transcript-senate-speech.html "Full Transcript: Jeff Flake’s Speech on the Senate Floor."] ''New York Times''.  24 October 2017.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Principles are absorbed in childhood through a process of [[socialization]]. There is a presumption of liberty of individuals that is restrained.  Exemplary principles include [[First, do no harm]], the [[golden rule]] and the [[doctrine of the mean]].

===As a juridic law===
{{Main|Principle of legality}}
It represents a set of values that inspire the written norms that organize the life of a society submitting to the powers of an authority, generally the State. The law establishes a legal obligation, in a coercive way; it therefore acts as principle [[Classical conditioning|conditioning]] of the action that limits the liberty of the individuals. See, for examples, the [[territorial principle]], [[homestead principle]], and [[precautionary principle]].

===As scientific law===
[[Archimedes principle]], relating buoyancy to the weight of displaced water, is an early example of a  [[law (principle)|law]] in science. Another early one developed by [[Malthus]] is the ''population principle'', now called the [[Malthusian principle]].&lt;ref&gt;Elwell, Frank W.  [http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/users/f/felwell/www/Theorists/Essays/Malthus1.htm "T. Robert Mathus's Principle ...."] ''Rogers State University''.  2013.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud also wrote on principles, especially the [[reality principle]] necessary to keep the id and [[pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] in check. Biologists use the [[principle of priority]] and [[principle of Binominal nomenclature]] for precision in naming [[species]]. There are many principles observed in physics, notably in [[cosmology]] which observes the [[mediocrity principle]], the [[anthropic principle]], the [[principle of relativity]] and the [[cosmological principle]]. Other well-known principles include the [[uncertainty principle]] in [[quantum mechanics]] and the [[pigeonhole principle]] and [[superposition principle]] in mathematics.

==As axiom or logical fundament==
===Principle of sufficient reason===
{{Main|Principle of sufficient reason}}
The principle states that every event has a rational explanation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sufficient-reason/ "Principle of Sufficient Reason."] ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.  7 September 2016.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The principle has a variety of expressions, all of which are perhaps best summarized by the following:

:For every entity ''x'', if ''x'' exists, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''x'' exists.
:For every event ''e'', if ''e'' occurs, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''e'' occurs.
:For every proposition ''p'', if ''p'' is true, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''p'' is true.

However, one realizes that in every sentence there is a direct relation between the predicate and the subject. To say that "the Earth is round", corresponds to a direct relation between the subject and the predicate.

===Principle of non-contradiction===
[[File:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bust (sculpture)|Portrait bust]] of Aristotle; an [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman]] copy of a lost [[bronze sculpture]] made by [[Lysippos]]]]
{{Main|Law of noncontradiction}}
According to [[Aristotle]], “It is impossible for the same thing to belong and not to belong at the same time to the same thing and in the same respect.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-noncontradiction/ "Aristotle on Non-contradiction."] ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.  12 June 2015.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it is not possible that in exactly the same moment and place, it rains and doesn't rain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl201/modules/Philosophers/Aristotle/aristotle_laws_of_thought.html "Great Philosophers."] ''Oregon State University''.  2002.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle of excluded middle===
{{Main|Law of excluded middle}}
The principle of the excluding third or "principium tertium exclusum" is a principle of the traditional logic formulated canonically by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] as: either ''A'' is ''B'' or ''A'' isn't ''B''. It is read the following way: either ''P'' is true, or its denial ¬''P'' is.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/AAT3201.0001.001|title=Principia mathematica, by Alfred North Whitehead ... and Bertrand Russell.|last=Whitehead|first=Alfred North|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also known as "''tertium non datur''" ('A third (thing) is not). Classically it is considered to be one of the most important fundamental principles or laws of thought (along with the principles of identity, no contradiction and sufficient reason).

{{Paranormal}}
The '''''preternatural''''' or '''''praeternatural''''' is that which appears outside or beside (Latin ''[[:Wikt:preter-|præter]]'') the [[nature|natural]]. It is "suspended between the mundane and the miraculous".&lt;ref&gt;Allchin, Douglas, "Monsters &amp; Marvels: How Do We Interpret the "Preternatural"?", ''The American Biology Teacher'', November 2007. p.565.&lt;/ref&gt;

In theology, the term is often used to distinguish marvels or deceptive trickery, often attributed to [[witchcraft]] or [[demon]]s, from the purely [[divinity|divine]] power of the genuinely supernatural to violate the laws of nature. In the [[early modern period]] the term was used by scientists to refer to abnormalities and strange phenomena of various kinds that seemed to depart from the norms of nature.

==Theology==
Medieval theologians made a clear distinction between the natural, the preternatural and the supernatural. [[Thomas Aquinas]] argued that the supernatural consists in "God’s unmediated actions"; the natural is "what happens always or most of the time"; and the preternatural is "what happens rarely, but nonetheless by the agency of created beings&amp;nbsp;... Marvels belong, properly speaking, to the realm of the preternatural."&lt;ref&gt;Israel Burshatin, "Elena Alias Elewno: Genders, sexualities, and 'race' in the mirror of natural history in sixteenth-century Spain" in Sabrina Petra Ramet, ''Gender Reversals and Gender Cultures: Anthropological and Historical Perspectives'', Routledge, New York, 1996, p.114.&lt;/ref&gt; Theologians, following Aquinas, argued that only God had the power to disregard the laws of nature that he has created, but that demons could manipulate the laws of nature by a form of trickery, to deceive the unwary into believing they had experienced real miracles. According to historian Lorraine Daston,

{{Quote | style=font-size: 100%; | Although demons, astral intelligences, and other spirits might manipulate natural causes with superhuman dexterity and thereby work marvels, as mere creatures they could never transcend from the preternatural to the supernatural and work genuine miracles.&lt;ref name = "Lor"&gt;Lorraine Daston, "Marvelous Facts and Miraculous Evidence in Early Modern Europe", Peter G. Platt, ''Wonders, Marvels, and Monsters in Early Modern Culture'', University of Delaware Press, Newark, 1999, pp.&amp;nbsp;76–105.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By the 16th century, the term "preternatural" was increasingly used to refer to demonic activity comparable to the use of magic by human adepts: The Devil, "being a natural Magician&amp;nbsp;... may perform many acts in ways above our knowledge, though not transcending our natural power."&lt;ref name = "Lor"/&gt; According to the philosophy of the time, preternatural phenomena were not contrary to divine law, but used hidden, or [[occult]] powers that violated the ''normal'' pattern of natural phenomena.&lt;ref name = "Lor"/&gt;

==Science==
With the emergence of early modern science, the concept of the preternatural increasingly came to be used to refer to strange or abnormal phenomena that seemed to violate the normal working of nature, but which were not associated with magic and witchcraft. This was a development of the idea that preternatural phenomena were fake miracles. As Daston puts it, "To simplify the historical sequence somewhat: first, preternatural phenomena were demonized and thereby incidentally naturalized; then the demons were deleted, leaving only the natural causes."&lt;ref name = "Lor"/&gt; The use of the term was especially common in medicine, for example in John Brown's ''A Compleat Treatise of Preternatural Tumours'' (1678), or [[William Smellie (obstetrician)|William Smellie]]'s ''A Collection of Preternatural Cases and Observations in Midwifery'' (1754).&lt;ref&gt;Samuel J. Rogal, ''Medicine in Great Britain from the Restoration to the Nineteenth Century, 1660–1800: An Annotated Bibliography'', Greenwood Press, New York, 1992, p.203.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century the term was appropriated in anthropology to refer to folk beliefs about fairies, trolls and other such creatures which were not thought of as demonic, but which were perceived to affect the natural world in unpredictable ways. According to [[Thorstein Veblen]], such preternatural agents were often thought of as forces somewhere between supernatural beings and material processes. "The preternatural agency is not necessarily conceived to be a personal agent in the full sense, but it is an agency which partakes of the attributes of personality to the extent of somewhat arbitrarily influencing the outcome of any enterprise, and especially of any contest."&lt;ref&gt;Veblen, T., ''The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study of Institutions'', Macmillan, New York, 1915, p.280&lt;/ref&gt;

The linguistic association between individual agents and unexplained or unfortunate circumstances remains. Many people attribute occurrences that are known to be material processes, such as "gremlins in the engine", a "ghost in the machine", or [[pathetic fallacy|attributing motives to objects]]: "the clouds are threatening". The anthropomorphism in our daily life is a combination of the above cultural stems, as well as the manifestation of our pattern-projecting minds.{{Original research inline|date=June 2015}}

==Scholarship==
In 2011, Penn State Press began publishing a learned journal titled ''Preternature: Critical and Historical Studies on the Preternatural''. Edited by Kirsten Uszkalo and Richard Raiswell, the journal is dedicated to publishing articles, reviews and short editions of original texts that deal with conceptions and perceptions of the preternatural in any culture and in any historical period. The journal covers "magics, witchcraft, spiritualism, occultism, prophecy, monstrophy, demonology, and folklore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psupress.org/journals/jnls_Preternature.html |title=''Preternature: Critical and Historical Studies on the Preternatural'' |publisher=Penn State University Press |access-date=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Evolution''' is any [[Process (science)|process]] of growth or development that entails change. The word stems from the [[Latin]] ''evolutio'' meaning "unfolding" and before the late 19th century was confined to referring to goal-directed, pre-programmed processes such as embryological development. A pre-programmed task, as in a military maneuver, using this definition, may be termed an "evolution." After the publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' in 1859, "evolution" became primarily associated with [[biological evolution]] as a non-guided process for the differentiation of forms of life from a common ancestor. Evolution can also refer to [[stellar evolution]], [[Chemical evolution (disambiguation)|chemical evolution]], [[cultural evolution]], [[spiritual evolution]] or the [[evolution of an idea]]. Other kinds of evolution include [[evolutionary algorithm]]s (which include [[genetic algorithm]]s) which attempt to mimic processes similar to biological evolution in a [[computer program]], most frequently as an [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] technique and as an experimental framework for the computational [[model (abstract)|modelling]] of evolution. It is also invoked as a concept in ideas on [[emergence|emergent order]].

'''Nature''', in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or [[universe]]. "Nature" can refer to the [[phenomenon|phenomena]] of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of [[science]]. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.

The word ''nature'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''natura'', or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".&lt;ref name="etymonline-nature"&gt;{{OEtymD|nature|accessdate=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Natura'' is a Latin translation of the Greek word ''[[physis]]'' (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord.&lt;ref&gt;An account of the pre-Socratic use of the concept of φύσις may be found in Naddaf, Gerard (2006) ''The Greek Concept of Nature'', SUNY Press. The word φύσις, while first used in connection with a plant in Homer, occurs very early in Greek philosophy, and in several senses. Generally, these senses match rather well the current senses in which the English word ''nature'' is used, as confirmed by Guthrie, W.K.C. ''Presocratic Tradition from Parmenides to Democritus'' (volume 2 of his ''History of Greek Philosophy''), Cambridge UP, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The first known use of ''physis'' was by [[Homer]] in reference to the intrinsic qualities of a plant: ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας πόρε φάρμακον ἀργεϊφόντης ἐκ γαίης ἐρύσας, καί μοι '''φύσιν''' αὐτοῦ ἔδειξε. (So saying, Argeiphontes [=Hermes] gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed me its '''nature'''.) ''[[Odyssey]]'' 10.302–3 (ed. A.T. Murray). (The word is dealt with thoroughly in Liddell and Scott's ''[http://archimedes.fas.harvard.edu/pollux Greek Lexicon]''.) For later but still very early Greek uses of the term, see earlier note.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of nature as a whole, the physical [[universe]], is one of several expansions of the original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] philosophers, and has steadily gained currency ever since. This usage continued during the advent of modern [[scientific method]] in the last several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton's [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]] (1687), for example, is translated "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy", and reflects the then-current use of the words "[[natural philosophy]]", akin to "systematic study of nature"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The etymology of the word "physical" shows its use as a synonym for "natural" in about the mid-15th century: {{OEtymD|physical|accessdate=September 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and [[wildlife]]. Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the [[Earth]]. It is often taken to mean the "[[natural environment]]" or [[wilderness]]—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature". This more traditional concept of natural things which can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human [[consciousness]] or a human [[mind]]. Depending on the particular context, the term "natural" might also be distinguished from the [[Wikt:unnatural|unnatural]] or the [[supernatural]].

Earth is the only [[planet]] known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research. Within the [[solar system]], it is third closest to the sun; it is the largest [[terrestrial planet]] and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow [[temperate]] zones, and a wide [[equator]]ial tropical to [[subtropical]] region.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre. 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].

Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the original conditions. The [[Crust (geology)|outer surface]] is divided into several gradually migrating [[tectonic plate]]s. The interior remains active, with a thick layer of plastic [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] and an iron-filled core that generates a [[magnetic field]]. This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.

The [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] conditions have been significantly altered from the original conditions by the presence of life-forms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date = September 11, 2005|url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/09/050911103921.htm|title = Calculations favor reducing atmosphere for early Earth|work=[[Science Daily]]|accessdate = January 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions. Despite the wide regional variations in climate by [[latitude]] and other geographic factors, the long-term average global climate is quite stable during interglacial periods,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/science/pastcc.html|title = Past Climate Change|publisher = U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate = January 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and variations of a degree or two of average global temperature have historically had major effects on the ecological balance, and on the actual geography of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hugh Anderson|author2=Bernard Walter|date = March 28, 1997|url = http://vathena.arc.nasa.gov/curric/land/global/climchng.html |title = History of Climate Change|publisher = NASA|accessdate = January 7, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080123130745/http://vathena.arc.nasa.gov/curric/land/global/climchng.html |archivedate = January 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Weart|first = Spencer|date=June 2006|url = http://www.aip.org/history/climate/|title = The Discovery of Global Warming|publisher = American Institute of Physics|accessdate = January 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geology===
{{Main|Geology}}
Geology is the science and study of the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the [[Earth]]. The field of geology encompasses the study of the composition, [[structural geology|structure]], [[Physical property|physical properties]], dynamics, and [[History of the Earth|history]] of [[Earth materials]], and the processes by which they are formed, moved, and changed. The field is a major [[academic discipline]], and is also important for [[mining|mineral]] and [[petroleum geology|hydrocarbon]] extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of [[natural hazard]]s, some [[Geotechnical engineering]] fields, and understanding [[Paleoclimatology|past climates]] and environments.

====Geological evolution====
[[File:Tectonic plate boundaries.png|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Three types of geological [[plate tectonic]] boundaries.]]
The geology of an area evolves through time as rock units are deposited and inserted and deformational processes change their shapes and locations.

Rock units are first emplaced either by [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] onto the surface or intrude into the [[Country rock (geology)|overlying rock]]. Deposition can occur when [[sediment]]s settle onto the surface of the Earth and later [[lithification|lithify]] into [[sedimentary rock]], or when as [[volcanic rock|volcanic material]] such as [[volcanic ash]] or [[lava]] flows, blanket the surface. Igneous [[intrusion]]s such as [[batholith]]s, [[laccolith]]s, [[dike (geology)|dikes]], and [[sill (geology)|sills]], push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.

After the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be [[deformation (mechanics)|deformed]] and/or [[metamorphism|metamorphosed]]. Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, [[extension (geology)|horizontal extension]], or side-to-side ([[strike-slip]]) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to [[convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]], [[divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]], and [[transform boundary|transform boundaries]], respectively, between [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]].

Earth is estimated to have formed 4.54&amp;nbsp;billion years ago from the [[solar nebula]], along with the [[Sun]] and other [[planet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=G.

Initially molten, the outer layer of the Earth cooled, resulting in the solid crust. Outgassing and [[Volcano|volcanic]] activity produced the primordial atmosphere.

Continents formed, then broke up and reformed as the surface of Earth reshaped over hundreds of millions of years, occasionally combining to make a [[supercontinent]]. Roughly 750&amp;nbsp;million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent [[Rodinia]], began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form [[Pannotia]] which broke apart about 540&amp;nbsp;million years ago, then finally [[Pangaea]], which broke apart about 180&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J.B. |last=Murphy |author2=R.D.

During the [[Neoproterozoic]] era, freezing temperatures covered much of the Earth in [[glacier]]s and ice sheets. This hypothesis has been termed the "[[Snowball Earth]]", and it is of particular interest as it precedes the [[Cambrian explosion]] in which multicellular life forms began to proliferate about 530–540&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J.L. |last=Kirschvink |date=1992 |chapter=Late Proterozoic Low-Latitude Global Glaciation: The Snowball Earth |chapterurl=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~jkirschvink/pdfs/firstsnowball.pdf |title=The Proterozoic Biosphere |editor=J.W.

Over the past 66&amp;nbsp;million years, mammalian life diversified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Margulis |first=Lynn |author2=Dorian Sagan |date=1995 |title=What is Life? |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-0-684-81326-4 |page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several million years ago, a species of small African [[ape]] gained the ability to stand upright.&lt;ref name="Margulis1995" /&gt; The subsequent advent of human life, and the development of agriculture and further [[civilization]] allowed humans to affect the Earth more rapidly than any previous life form, affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate. By comparison, the [[Great Oxygenation Event]], produced by the proliferation of [[algae]] during the [[Siderian]] period, required about 300&amp;nbsp;million years to culminate.

The present era is classified as part of a mass [[extinction event]], the [[Holocene extinction]] event, the fastest ever to have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Diamond J|title = The present, past and future of human-caused extinctions|journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci|volume = 325|issue = 1228|pages = 469–76; discussion 476–77|date = 1989|pmid = 2574887|doi = 10.1098/rstb.1989.0100|last2 = Ashmole|first2 = N.

==Atmosphere, climate, and weather==
[[File:Top of Atmosphere.jpg|thumb|[[Rayleigh scattering|Blue light is scattered more]] than other wavelengths by the gases in the [[atmosphere]], giving the Earth a blue [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]] when seen from space]]
{{Main|Atmosphere of Earth|Climate|Weather}}
The Earth's atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining the [[Nature#Ecosystems|ecosystem]]. The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by gravity. Air is mostly [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[water vapor]], with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, etc. The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude. The [[ozone layer]] plays an important role in depleting the amount of [[ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As [[DNA]] is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.

Terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the [[troposphere|lower part of the atmosphere]], and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AJ4SnHbb-ZcC&amp;pg=PA42|title=Environmental Science: Problems, Connections and Solutions|last=Miller|first=G.|last2=Spoolman|first2=Scott|date=September 28, 2007|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-38337-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ocean current]]s are another important factor in determining climate, particularly the major underwater [[thermohaline circulation]] which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions. These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones. Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the [[polar region]]s much colder.
[[File:Lightnings sequence 2 animation-wcag.gif|thumb|left|[[Lightning]]]]
Weather can have both beneficial and harmful effects. Extremes in weather, such as [[tornado]]es or [[hurricane]]s and [[cyclone]]s, can expend large amounts of energy along their paths, and produce devastation. Surface vegetation has evolved a dependence on the seasonal variation of the weather, and sudden changes lasting only a few years can have a dramatic effect, both on the vegetation and on the animals which depend on its growth for their food.

Climate is a measure of the long-term trends in the weather. Various factors are known to [[Climate change|influence the climate]], including ocean currents, surface [[albedo]], [[greenhouse gas]]es, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the Earth's orbit. Based on historical records, the Earth is known to have undergone drastic climate changes in the past, including [[ice age]]s.
[[File:Dszpics1.jpg|thumb|A tornado in central [[Oklahoma]]]]
The climate of a region depends on a number of factors, especially [[latitude]]. A latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region. There are a number of such regions, ranging from the [[tropical climate]] at the equator to the [[polar climate]] in the northern and southern extremes. Weather is also influenced by the seasons, which result from the [[Earth]]'s [[axis of rotation|axis]] being [[axial tilt|tilted]] relative to its [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]. Thus, at any given time during the summer or winter, one part of the Earth is more directly exposed to the rays of the [[sun]]. This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. At any given time, regardless of season, the [[northern hemisphere|northern]] and [[southern hemisphere|southern]] hemispheres experience opposite seasons.

Weather is a [[Chaos theory|chaotic system]] that is readily modified by small changes to the [[Natural environment|environment]], so accurate [[Meteorology|weather forecasting]] is limited to only a few days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stern|first=Harvey|last2=Davidson|first2=Noel|date=May 25, 2015|title=Trends in the skill of weather prediction at lead times of 1–14 days|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society|volume=141|issue=692|pages=2726–36|via=Wiley|doi=10.1002/qj.2559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, two things are happening worldwide: (1) temperature is increasing on the average; and (2) regional climates have been undergoing noticeable changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tropical Ocean Warming Drives Recent Northern Hemisphere Climate Change|publisher=Science Daily|date=April 6, 2001|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/04/010406073554.htm|accessdate=May 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UNEP]].&lt;/ref&gt; Oceans hold 97% of surface water, [[glacier]]s, and polar [[ice cap]]s 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%. Additionally, a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.

===Oceans===

{{Main|Ocean}}
An ocean is a major body of [[Seawater|saline water]], and a principal component of the hydrosphere. Approximately 71% of the Earth's surface (an area of some 361 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a [[World Ocean|continuous body of water]] that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas. More than half of this area is over {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} deep. Average oceanic [[salinity]] is around 35 [[parts per thousand]] (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt. Though generally recognized as several 'separate' oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the [[World Ocean]] or global ocean.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.answers.com/Ocean#Encyclopedia Ocean]". ''The Columbia Encyclopedia.'' 2002. New York: Columbia University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNAoO"&gt;"[http://www.oceansatlas.com/unatlas/about/physicalandchemicalproperties/background/seemore1.html Distribution of land and water on the planet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531103749/http://www.oceansatlas.com/unatlas/about/physicalandchemicalproperties/background/seemore1.html |date=May 31, 2008 }}". [http://www.oceansatlas.com/ UN Atlas of the Oceans]&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of a global ocean as a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to [[oceanography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spilhaus | first1 = Athelstan F | year = 1942 | title = Maps of the whole world ocean | url = | journal = Geographical Review | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 431–35 | doi=10.2307/210385| jstor = 210385 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the [[continent]]s, various [[archipelago]]s, and other criteria: these divisions are (in descending order of size) the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the [[Southern Ocean]], and the Arctic Ocean. Smaller regions of the oceans are called seas, [[Headlands and bays|gulfs]], [[bay]]s and other names. There are also [[salt lake]]s, which are smaller bodies of landlocked saltwater that are not interconnected with the World Ocean. Two notable examples of salt lakes are the [[Aral Sea]] and the [[Great Salt Lake]].

===Lakes===
[[File:Lake mapourika NZ.jpeg|thumb|[[Lake Mapourika]], New Zealand]]
{{Main|Lake}}
A lake (from Latin ''lacus'') is a [[terrain feature]] (or [[physical feature]]), a body of liquid on the surface of a world that is localized to the bottom of [[Depression (geology)|basin]] (another type of landform or terrain feature; that is, it is not global) and moves slowly if it moves at all. On Earth, a body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|quote=[a Lake is] any relatively large body of slowly moving or standing water that occupies an inland basin of appreciable size. Definitions that precisely distinguish lakes, ponds, swamps, and even rivers and other bodies of nonoceanic water are not well established. It may be said, however, that rivers and streams are relatively fast moving; marshes and swamps contain relatively large quantities of grasses, trees, or shrubs; and ponds are relatively small in comparison to lakes. Geologically defined, lakes are temporary bodies of water.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lake Definition|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/lake|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only world other than Earth known to harbor lakes is [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], Saturn's largest moon, which has lakes of [[ethane]], most likely mixed with [[methane]]. It is not known if Titan's lakes are fed by rivers, though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds. Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, [[rift zone]]s, and areas with ongoing or recent [[glacier|glaciation]]. Other lakes are found in [[endorheic basin]]s or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last [[Ice Age]]. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.

====Ponds====
[[File:Mill Pond Sunset.jpg|thumb|The Westborough Reservoir (Mill Pond) in [[Westborough, Massachusetts]].]]
{{Main|Pond}}
A '''pond''' is a [[body of water|body]] of [[Water stagnation|standing water]], either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including [[water garden]]s designed for aesthetic ornamentation, [[fish pond]]s designed for commercial fish breeding, and [[solar pond]]s designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via [[current (stream)|current]] speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as [[stream pool]]s and [[tide pool]]s.

===Rivers===
[[File:View from Cairo Tower 31march2007.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Nile]] river in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]'s capital city]]
{{Main|River}}
A river is a natural [[watercourse]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/river River {definition}] from Merriam-Webster. Accessed February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; usually [[freshwater]], flowing toward an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up completely before reaching another body of water. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is ''Burn'' in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes a river is said to be larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/faqs.htm USGS – U.S. Geological Survey – FAQs], No. 17 What is the difference between mountain, hill, and [[Summit (topography)|peak]]; lake and pond; or river and [[stream|creek]]?&lt;/ref&gt; A river is part of the [[hydrological cycle]]. Water within a river is generally collected from [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] through [[surface runoff]], [[groundwater]] recharge, [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]], and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from [[glacier]]s).

===Streams===
[[File:Hawaii Creek.jpg|thumb|A rocky stream in [[Hawaii]]]]
{{Main|Stream}}
A stream is a flowing body of water with a [[Current (stream)|current]], confined within a [[stream bed|bed]] and [[stream bank]]s. In the United States, a stream is classified as a watercourse less than {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=off}} wide. Streams are important as conduits in the [[water cycle]], instruments in [[groundwater recharge]], and they serve as corridors for fish and [[wildlife]] migration. The biological [[habitat]] in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a [[riparian zone]]. Given the status of the ongoing [[Holocene extinction]], streams play an important [[wildlife corridor|corridor]] role in connecting [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmented habitats]] and thus in conserving [[biodiversity]]. The study of streams and waterways in general involves many branches of inter-disciplinary natural science and engineering, including [[hydrology]], [[geomorphology|fluvial geomorphology]], [[aquatic ecology]], [[Freshwater fish|fish biology]], [[riparian|riparian ecology]], and others.

{{Main|Ecology|Ecosystem}}
Ecosystems are composed of a variety of [[abiotic]] and [[Biotic component|biotic]] components that function in an interrelated way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pidwirny |first=Michael |date=2006 |work=Fundamentals of Physical Geography (2nd Edition) |title=Introduction to the Biosphere: Introduction to the Ecosystem Concept |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/9j.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure and composition is determined by various environmental factors that are interrelated. Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic modifications to the ecosystem. Some of the more important components are: [[soil]], atmosphere, radiation from the [[sun]], water, and living organisms.
[[File:PenasBlancas, part of the Bosawas Reserve, Jinotega Department, Nicaragua.jpg|thumb|left|Peñas Blancas, part of the [[Bosawás Biosphere Reserve]]. Located northeast of the city of [[Jinotega]] in Northeastern Nicaragua.]]
Central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that [[living organism]]s interact with every other element in their local [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Eugene Odum, a founder of ecology, stated: "Any unit that includes all of the organisms (ie: the "community") in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem."&lt;ref name="Odum1971"&gt;Odum, EP (1971) ''Fundamentals of ecology'', 3rd edition, Saunders New York&lt;/ref&gt; Within the ecosystem, species are connected and dependent upon one another in the [[food chain]], and exchange energy and [[matter]] between themselves as well as with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pidwirny |first=Michael |date=2006 |work=Fundamentals of Physical Geography (2nd edition) |title=Introduction to the Biosphere: Organization of Life |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/9d.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human ecosystem concept is based on the human/nature [[dichotomy]] and the idea that all species are ecologically dependent on each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their [[biotope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-s5oRDUuMSIC&amp;pg=PA237|title=Biotechnology Fundamentals|last=Khan|first=Firdos Alam|date=2011-09-20|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-2009-4|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A smaller unit of size is called a [[microecosystem]]. For example, a microsystem can be a stone and all the life under it. A ''macroecosystem'' might involve a whole [[ecoregion]], with its [[drainage basin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey |first=Robert G. |date=April 2004 |title=Identifying Ecoregion Boundaries |journal=Environmental Management |volume=34 |pmid=15883869 |issue=Supplement 1 |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/institute/news_info/Identifying_ecoregion_boundaries.pdf |doi=10.1007/s00267-003-0163-6 |pages=S14–26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lleZy8MU?url=http://www.fs.fed.us/institute/news_info/Identifying_ecoregion_boundaries.pdf |archivedate=December 4, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wilderness===
[[File:Biogradska suma.jpg|thumb|[[Old-growth forest|Old growth]] [[European Beech]] forest in [[Biogradska Gora]] National Park, [[Montenegro]].]]
{{Main|Wilderness}}
'''Wilderness''' is generally defined as areas that have not been significantly modified by human activity. Wilderness areas can be found in preserves, estates, farms, conservation preserves, ranches, [[:Category:national forests|national forests]], [[national park]]s, and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches, or otherwise undeveloped areas. Wilderness areas and protected [[parks]] are considered important for the survival of certain [[species]], ecological studies, [[Habitat conservation|conservation]], and solitude. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity,&lt;ref name="Man p155-157"&gt;Botkin, Daniel B. (2000) ''No Man's Garden'', Island Press, pp. 155–57, {{ISBN|1-55963-465-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and some ecologists consider wilderness areas to be an integral part of the Earth's self-sustaining natural [[ecosystem]] (the [[biosphere]]). They may also preserve historic [[genetics|genetic]] traits and that they provide [[habitat]] for wild [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] that may be difficult or impossible to recreate in [[zoo]]s, [[arboretum]]s, or [[laboratory|laboratories]].

==Life==
{{Life timeline}}
[[File:Malards in Golden Gate Park.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Female mallard and ducklings – [[reproduction]] is essential for continuing life]]
{{Main|Life|Biology|Biosphere}}
Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by [[Organism|organization]], [[metabolism]], [[cell growth|growth]], [[adaptation]], response to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], and [[reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2006 |url=http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |title=Definition of Life |publisher=California Academy of Sciences |accessdate=January 7, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208220940/http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |archivedate=February 8, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of [[organism]]s.

Properties common to terrestrial organisms (plants, animals, [[Fungus|fungi]], [[protist]]s, [[archaea]], and bacteria) are that they are cellular, carbon-and-water-based with complex organization, having a metabolism, a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. An entity with these properties is generally considered life. However, not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential. Human-made [[Artificial life|analogs of life]] may also be considered to be life.

The [[biosphere]] is the part of Earth's outer shell&amp;nbsp;– including land, surface rocks, water, air and the atmosphere&amp;nbsp;– within which life occurs, and which [[Biology|biotic]] processes in turn alter or transform. From the broadest [[Geophysiology|geophysiological]] point of view, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the [[lithosphere]] (rocks), [[hydrosphere]] (water), and [[atmosphere]] (air). The entire Earth contains over 75&amp;nbsp;billion tons (150 ''trillion'' pounds or about 6.8×10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kilograms) of [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] (life), which lives within various environments within the biosphere.&lt;ref&gt;The figure "about one-half of one percent" takes into account the following (See, e.g., {{cite book |last=Leckie |first=Stephen |date=1999 |chapter=How Meat-centred Eating Patterns Affect Food Security and the Environment |chapterurl=http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-30610-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html |title=For hunger-proof cities: sustainable urban food systems |publisher=International Development Research Centre |location=Ottawa |isbn=978-0-88936-882-8 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113020336/http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-30610-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html }}, which takes global average weight as 60&amp;nbsp;kg.), the total human biomass is the average weight multiplied by the current human population of approximately 6.5&amp;nbsp;billion (see, ''e.g.'', {{cite web |title=World Population Information |url=https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/world.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau }}{{Dead link|date=February 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}): Assuming 60–70&amp;nbsp;kg to be the average human mass (approximately 130–150&amp;nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]] on the average), an approximation of total global human mass of between 390&amp;nbsp;billion (390×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) and 455&amp;nbsp;billion kg (between 845&amp;nbsp;billion and 975&amp;nbsp;billion lb, or about 423&amp;nbsp;million–488&amp;nbsp;million [[short ton]]s). The total biomass of all kinds on earth is estimated to be in excess of 6.8&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg (75&amp;nbsp;billion short tons).

Since then, it has become clear that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the [[fungus|fungi]] and several groups of [[alga]]e were removed to new kingdoms. However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts. Bacterial life is sometimes included in flora,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=flora |url=http://webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=flora |work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=September 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=1998 |title=Status and Trends of the Nation's Biological Resources |chapter=Glossary |chapterurl=http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/zy198.htm |publisher=Department of the Interior, Geological Survey |location=Reston, VA |id=SuDocs No. I 19.202:ST 1/V.1-2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715060359/http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/zy198.htm |archivedate=July 15, 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some classifications use the term ''bacterial flora'' separately from ''plant flora''.

Among the many ways of classifying plants are by regional [[flora]]s, which, depending on the purpose of study, can also include ''fossil flora'', remnants&lt;br&gt; of plant life from a previous era. People in many regions and countries take great pride in their individual arrays of characteristic flora, which can vary widely across the globe due to differences in climate and [[terrain]].

Regional floras commonly are divided into categories such as ''native flora'' and ''agricultural and garden flora'', the lastly mentioned of which are intentionally grown and cultivated. Some types of "native flora" actually have been introduced centuries ago by people migrating from one region or continent to another, and become an integral part of the native, or natural flora of the place to which they were introduced. This is an example of how human interaction with nature can blur the boundary of what is considered nature.

Another category of plant has historically been carved out for ''weeds''. Though the term has fallen into disfavor among [[botanist]]s as a formal way to categorize "useless" plants, the informal use of the word "weeds" to describe those plants that are deemed worthy of elimination is illustrative of the general tendency of people and societies to seek to alter or shape the course of nature. Similarly, animals are often categorized in ways such as ''domestic'', ''farm animals'', ''wild animals'', ''pests'', etc. according to their relationship to human life.

Animals as a category have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things. Animals are [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] and usually [[multicellular]] (although see [[Myxozoa]]), which separates them from bacteria, [[archaea]], and most [[protist]]s. They are [[heterotroph]]ic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and [[alga]]e. They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and [[fungus|fungi]] by lacking [[cell wall]]s.

With a few exceptions—most notably the two [[Phylum|phyla]] consisting of [[sponge]]s and [[placozoa]]ns—animals have bodies that are differentiated into [[biological tissue|tissues]]. These include [[muscle]]s, which are able to contract and control locomotion, and a [[nervous system]], which sends and processes signals. There is also typically an internal [[digestion|digestive]] chamber. The eukaryotic cells possessed by all animals are surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of [[collagen]] and elastic [[glycoprotein]]s. This may be calcified to form structures like [[Animal shell|shells]], [[bone]]s, and [[spicule (sponge)|spicules]], a framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized during development and maturation, and which supports the complex anatomy required for mobility.

==Human interrelationship==
{{Human timeline}}
[[File:Na Pali Coast - Kauai.jpg|thumb|left|Despite their natural beauty, the secluded valleys along the [[Na Pali Coast]] in Hawaii are heavily modified by introduced [[invasive species]] such as [[She-oak]].]]
Although humans comprise only a minuscule proportion of the total living biomass on Earth, the human effect on nature is disproportionately large. Because of the extent of human influence, the boundaries between what humans regard as nature and "made environments" is not clear cut except at the extremes. Even at the extremes, the amount of natural environment that is free of discernible human influence is diminishing at an increasingly rapid pace.

The development of technology by the human race has allowed the greater exploitation of natural resources and has helped to alleviate some of the risk from natural hazards. In spite of this progress, however, the fate of human [[civilization]] remains closely linked to changes in the environment. There exists a highly complex feedback loop between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment that are only slowly becoming understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Feedback Loops in Global Climate Change Point to a Very Hot 21st Century|publisher=Science Daily|date=May 22, 2006|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/ESD-feedback-loops.html|accessdate=January 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Man-made threats to the Earth's natural environment include pollution, [[deforestation]], and disasters such as oil spills. Humans have contributed to the [[extinction]] of many plants and animals.

Humans employ nature for both leisure and economic activities. The acquisition of natural resources for industrial use remains a sizable component of the world's economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://knoema.com/zscvyje/natural-resources-contribution-to-gdp|title=Natural Resources contribution to GDP|date=November 2014|website=World Development Indicators (WDI)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223080408/https://knoema.com/zscvyje/natural-resources-contribution-to-gdp|archive-date=December 23, 2014|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2012.html|title=GDP – Composition by Sector|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|work=[[The World Factbook]]|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some activities, such as hunting and fishing, are used for both sustenance and leisure, often by different people. [[Agriculture#History|Agriculture]] was first adopted around the [[9th millennium BCE]]. Ranging from food production to energy, nature influences economic wealth.

Although early humans gathered uncultivated plant materials for food and employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nps.gov/plants/medicinal/plants.htm|title = Plant Conservation Alliance – Medicinal Plant Working Groups Green Medicine|publisher = US National Park Services |accessdate=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; most modern human use of plants is through agriculture. The clearance of large tracts of land for crop growth has led to a significant reduction in the amount available of forestation and wetlands, resulting in the loss of habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Oosthoek|first = Jan|date = 1999|url = http://www.eh-resources.org/philosophy.html|title = Environmental History: Between Science &amp; Philosophy|publisher = Environmental History Resources|accessdate = December 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetics and beauty===
[[File:504px-Pinguiculagrandiflora1web.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Pinguicula grandiflora]]'', commonly known as a [[Butterwort]]]]
Beauty in nature has historically been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty. Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called [[aesthetics]]. Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilderness.org/Library/Documents/Beauty_Quotes.cfm |title=On the Beauty of Nature |publisher=The Wilderness Society |accessdate=September 29, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909220214/http://www.wilderness.org/Library/Documents/Beauty_Quotes.cfm |archivedate=September 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history. An early tradition of [[landscape art]] began in China during the [[Tang Dynasty art|Tang Dynasty]] (618–907). The tradition of representing nature ''as it is'' became one of the aims of [[Chinese painting]] and was a significant influence in Asian art.

Although natural wonders are celebrated in the [[Psalms]] and the [[Book of Job]], [[wilderness]] portrayals in art became more prevalent in the 1800s, especially in the works of the [[Romantic movement]]. [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] artists [[John Constable]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]] turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings. Before that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings. [[William Wordsworth]]'s poetry described the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place. Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture.&lt;ref name=History&gt;[http://www.spacesfornature.org/greatspaces/conservation.html History of Conservation] BC Spaces for Nature. Accessed: May 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This artistic movement also coincided with the [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist movement]] in the Western world. A common classical idea of beautiful art involves the word [[mimesis]], the imitation of nature. Also in the realm of ideas about beauty in nature is that the perfect is implied through perfect mathematical [[Substantial form|forms]] and more generally by [[patterns in nature]]. As David Rothenburg writes, "The beautiful is the root of science and the goal of art, the highest possibility that humanity can ever hope to see".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Survival of the Beautiful: Art, Science and Evolution | publisher=Bloomsbury | author=Rothenberg, David |isbn=978-1-60819-216-8| date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|281}}

==Matter and energy==
[[File:Hydrogen Density Plots.png|thumb|The first few [[hydrogen atom]] [[Atomic orbital|electron orbitals]] shown as cross-sections with color-coded probability density]]
{{Main|Matter|Energy}}
Some fields of science see nature as matter in motion, obeying certain laws of nature which science seeks to understand. For this reason the most fundamental science is generally understood to be "[[physics]]"&amp;nbsp;– the name for which is still recognizable as meaning that it is the study of nature.

Matter is commonly defined as the substance of which physical objects are composed. It constitutes the [[observable universe]]. The visible components of the universe are now believed to compose only 4.9 percent of the total mass. The remainder is believed to consist of 26.8 percent [[cold dark matter]] and 68.3 percent [[dark energy]].&lt;ref name="planck_overview"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Planck 2013 results. I. Overview of products and scientific results – Table 9. |journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] |first1=P. A. R. |last1=Ade |first2=N. |last2=Aghanim |first3=C. |last3=Armitage-Caplan |last4=et al.

The behavior of matter and energy throughout the observable universe appears to follow well-defined [[physical law]]s. These laws have been employed to produce [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] models that successfully explain the structure and the evolution of the universe we can observe. The mathematical expressions of the laws of physics employ a set of twenty [[physical constant]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Taylor|first = Barry N.|date = 1971|url = http://www.physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/introduction.html|title = Introduction to the constants for nonexperts|publisher = National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate = January 7, 2007
}}&lt;/ref&gt; that appear to be static across the observable universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Varshalovich, D.A.|author2=Potekhin, A.Y.|author3=Ivanchik, A.V. |last-author-amp=yes|title=Testing cosmological variability of fundamental constants|journal=AIP Conference Proceedings|date=2000|volume=506|page=503|arxiv=physics/0004062|doi=10.1063/1.1302777|bibcode=2000AIPC..506..503V|citeseerx=10.1.1.43.6877}}&lt;/ref&gt; The values of these constants have been carefully measured, but the reason for their specific values remains a mystery.

==Beyond Earth==
[[File:Planets2013.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Planet]]s of the [[Solar System]] ''(Sizes to scale, distances and illumination not to scale)'']]
[[File:NGC 4414 (NASA-med).jpg|thumb|'''[[NGC 4414]]''' is a spiral galaxy in the constellation [[Coma Berenices]] about 56,000 [[light-year]]s in diameter and approximately 60 million light-years from [[Earth]]]]
{{Main|Outer space|Universe|Extraterrestrial life}}
Outer space, also simply called ''space'', refers to the relatively empty regions of the [[universe]] outside the [[atmosphere]]s of celestial bodies. ''Outer'' space is used to distinguish it from [[airspace]] (and terrestrial locations). There is no discrete boundary between the [[Earth's atmosphere]] and space, as the atmosphere gradually attenuates with increasing altitude. Outer space within the [[Solar System]] is called [[interplanetary space]], which passes over into [[interstellar medium|interstellar space]] at what is known as the [[heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]].

Outer space is sparsely filled with several dozen types of [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[molecule]]s discovered to date by [[rotational spectroscopy|microwave spectroscopy]], [[cosmic microwave background radiation|blackbody radiation]] left over from the [[big bang]] and the origin of the universe, and [[cosmic ray]]s, which include [[ion]]ized [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and various [[subatomic particle]]s. There is also some gas, [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] and [[dust]], and small [[meteor]]s. Additionally, there are signs of human life in outer space today, such as material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches which are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this [[space debris|debris]] re-enters the atmosphere periodically.

Although the Earth is the only body within the solar system known to support life, evidence suggests that in the distant past the planet [[Mars]] possessed bodies of liquid water on the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Bibring, J |display-authors=etal|title = Global mineralogical and aqueous mars history derived from OMEGA/Mars Express data|journal = Science|volume = 312|issue = 5772|pages = 400–04|date = 2006|pmid = 16627738|doi = 10.1126/science.1122659|bibcode = 2006Sci...312..400B}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a brief period in Mars' history, it may have also been capable of forming life. At present though, most of the water remaining on Mars is frozen.
If life exists at all on Mars, it is most likely to be located underground where liquid water can still exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first = Tariq|last = Malik|date = March 8, 2005|url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7129347/|title = Hunt for Mars life should go underground|publisher = Space.com via msnbc.msn.com |accessdate=September 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conditions on the other terrestrial planets, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]], appear to be too harsh to support life as we know it. But it has been conjectured that [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], the fourth-largest moon of [[Jupiter]], may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Turner, Scott |date = March 2, 1998|url = http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/news8.html|title = Detailed Images From Europa Point To Slush Below Surface|publisher = NASA |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomers have started to discover extrasolar [[Earth analog]]s – planets that lie in the [[habitable zone]] of space surrounding a [[star]], and therefore could possibly host life as we know it.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, Charles Q.

'''Patterns in nature''' are visible regularities of form found in the natural world. These [[patterns]] recur in different contexts and can sometimes be [[modelled mathematically]]. Natural patterns include [[symmetries]], [[trees]], [[spirals]], [[meanders]], [[wave]]s, [[foams]], [[tessellations]], [[fracture|cracks]] and stripes.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=3}} Early [[Greek philosophers]] studied pattern, with [[Plato]], [[Pythagoras]] and [[Empedocles]] attempting to explain order in nature. The modern understanding of visible patterns developed gradually over time.

In the 19th century, Belgian physicist [[Joseph Plateau]] examined [[soap film]]s, leading him to formulate the concept of a [[minimal surface]]. German biologist and artist [[Ernst Haeckel]] painted hundreds of [[Marine biology|marine organisms]] to emphasise their [[symmetry]]. Scottish biologist [[D'Arcy Thompson]] pioneered the study of growth patterns in both plants and animals, showing that simple equations could explain spiral growth. In the 20th century, British mathematician [[Alan Turing]] predicted mechanisms of [[morphogenesis]] which give rise to [[Turing patterns|patterns]] of spots and stripes. Hungarian biologist [[Aristid Lindenmayer]] and French American mathematician [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] showed how the mathematics of [[fractals]] could create plant growth patterns.

[[Mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] can explain patterns in nature at different levels. Patterns in living things are explained by the [[biology|biological]] processes of [[natural selection]] and [[sexual selection]]. Studies of [[pattern formation]] make use of [[computer models]] to simulate a wide range of patterns.

==History==
[[File:Cycas circinalis male cone in Olomouc.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fibonacci number]] patterns occur widely in plant structures, including this cone of queen sago, ''[[Cycas circinalis]]'']]

Early Greek philosophers attempted to explain order in [[nature]], anticipating modern concepts. [[Pythagoras]] (c.&amp;nbsp;570–c.&amp;nbsp;495&amp;nbsp;BC) explained patterns in nature like the harmonies of music as arising from number, which he took to be the basic constituent of existence.{{efn|The so-called [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]], who were the first to take up mathematics, not only advanced this subject, but saturated with it, they fancied that the principles of mathematics were the principles of all things. [[Aristotle]], ''Metaphysics 1–5 '', c. 350 BC}} [[Empedocles]] (c.&amp;nbsp;494–c.&amp;nbsp;434&amp;nbsp;BC) to an extent anticipated [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s evolutionary explanation for the structures of organisms.{{efn|Aristotle reports Empedocles arguing that, "[w]herever, then, everything turned out as it would have if it were happening for a purpose, there the creatures survived, being accidentally compounded in a suitable way; but where this did not happen, the creatures perished."

In 1952, [[Alan Turing]] (1912–1954), better known for his work on computing and [[codebreaking]], wrote ''[[The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis]]'', an analysis of the mechanisms that would be needed to create patterns in living organisms, in the process called [[morphogenesis]].&lt;ref name=Turing&gt;{{Cite journal| last= Turing | first= A.

In 1968, the Hungarian theoretical biologist [[Aristid Lindenmayer]] (1925–1989) developed the [[L-system]], a [[formal grammar]] which can be used to model [[plant development|plant growth patterns]] in the style of [[fractal]]s.&lt;ref name=L&gt;[[Rozenberg, Grzegorz]]; Salomaa, Arto.

In 1975, after centuries of slow development of the mathematics of patterns by [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[Georg Cantor]], [[Helge von Koch]], [[Wacław Sierpiński]] and others, [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] wrote a famous paper, ''[[How Long Is the Coast of Britain?

The laws of [[physics]] apply the abstractions of mathematics to the real world, often as if it were [[perfection#Physics and chemistry|perfect]].

== Types of pattern ==

=== Symmetry ===

{{further|Symmetry in biology|Floral symmetry|Crystal symmetry}}

[[Symmetry]] is pervasive in living things. Animals mainly have bilateral or [[Reflection symmetry|mirror symmetry]], as do the leaves of plants and some flowers such as [[orchid]]s.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=48–49}} Plants often have radial or [[rotational symmetry]], as do many flowers and some groups of animals such as [[sea anemone]]s. Fivefold symmetry is found in the [[echinoderms]], the group that includes [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s, and [[sea lilies]].{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=64–65}}

Among non-living things, [[snowflake]]s have striking [[dihedral symmetry|sixfold symmetry]]; each flake's structure forms a record of the varying conditions during its crystallization, with nearly the same pattern of growth on each of its six arms.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|page=52}} [[Crystal]]s in general have a variety of symmetries and [[crystal habit]]s; they can be cubic or octahedral, but true crystals cannot have fivefold symmetry (unlike [[quasicrystals]]).{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=82–84}} Rotational symmetry is found at different scales among non-living things, including the crown-shaped [[Splash (fluid mechanics)|splash]] pattern formed when a drop falls into a pond,{{sfn|Stewart|2001|page=60}} and both the [[spheroidal]] shape and rings of a [[planet]] like [[Saturn]].{{sfn|Stewart|2001|page=71}}

Symmetry has a variety of causes. Radial symmetry suits organisms like sea anemones whose adults do not move: food and threats may arrive from any direction. But animals that move in one direction necessarily have upper and lower sides, head and tail ends, and therefore a left and a right. The head becomes specialised with a mouth and sense organs ([[cephalisation]]), and the body becomes bilaterally symmetric (though internal organs need not be).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://biocongroup.eu/DA/Calendario_files/Bilateria.pdf | title=Animal Diversity | edition=Third | publisher=McGraw-Hill | work=Chapter 8: Acoelomate Bilateral Animals | date=2002 | accessdate=October 25, 2012 | author=Hickman, Cleveland P. | author2=Roberts, Larry S. | author3=Larson, Allan | pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; More puzzling is the reason for the fivefold (pentaradiate) symmetry of the echinoderms. Early echinoderms were bilaterally symmetrical, as their larvae still are. Sumrall and Wray argue that the loss of the old symmetry had both developmental and ecological causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=4500143 | title=Ontogeny in the fossil record: diversification of body plans and the evolution of "aberrant" symmetry in Paleozoic echinoderms | author=Sumrall, Colin D. | author2=Wray, Gregory A. | journal=Paleobiology |date=January 2007 | volume=33 | issue=1 | pages=149–163 |doi=10.1666/06053.1}} &lt;!--http://www.psjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1666/06053.1--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trees, fractals ===

[[Fractal]]s are infinitely [[self-similarity|self-similar]], iterated mathematical constructs having [[fractal dimension]].&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mandelbrot, Benoît B. | title=The fractal geometry of nature| date=1983 |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Falconer"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Falconer | first = Kenneth | authorlink=Kenneth Falconer (mathematician) | title = Fractal Geometry: Mathematical Foundations and Applications | publisher = John Wiley | date = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="patterns"&gt;{{Cite book | title=Fractals:The Patterns of Chaos | last=Briggs | first=John | authorlink= |date= 1992|publisher= Thames and Hudson |page=148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infinite [[iteration]] is not possible in nature so all 'fractal' patterns are only approximate. For example, the leaves of [[fern]]s and [[umbellifer]]s (Apiaceae) are only self-similar (pinnate) to 2, 3 or 4 levels. Fern-like growth patterns occur in plants and in animals including [[bryozoa]], [[coral]]s, [[hydrozoa]] like the [[air fern]], ''Sertularia argentea'', and in non-living things, notably [[electrical discharge]]s. [[L-system|Lindenmayer system]] fractals can model different patterns of tree growth by varying a small number of parameters including branching angle, distance between nodes or branch points ([[Internode (botany)|internode]] length), and number of branches per branch point.&lt;ref name=L/&gt;

=== Spirals ===
{{further|phyllotaxis}}

[[Spirals]] are common in plants and in some animals, notably [[molluscs]]. For example, in the [[nautilus]], a cephalopod mollusc, each [[Camera (cephalopod)|chamber]] of its shell is an approximate copy of the next one, scaled by a constant factor and arranged in a [[logarithmic spiral]].&lt;ref&gt;Maor, Eli. ''e: The Story of a Number''. Princeton University Press, 2009. Page 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Given a modern understanding of fractals, a growth spiral can be seen as a special case of self-similarity.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=29–32}}

Plant spirals can be seen in [[phyllotaxis]], the arrangement of leaves on a stem, and in the arrangement ([[parastichy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.math.smith.edu/phyllo/About/Lattices/SpiralLattices.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526030701/http://www.math.smith.edu/phyllo/About/Lattices/SpiralLattices.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=26 May 2010 | title=Spiral Lattices &amp; Parastichy | publisher=Smith College | accessdate=24 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) of other parts as in [[compositae|composite]] [[flower|flower heads]] and [[seed|seed heads]] like the [[sunflower]] or [[fruit]] structures like the [[pineapple]]&lt;ref name=livio111/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kappraff&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.scipress.org/journals/forma/pdf/1904/19040335.pdf | title=Growth in Plants: A Study in Number | author=Kappraff, Jay | journal=Forma | date=2004 | volume=19 | pages=335–354}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|337}} and [[salak|snake fruit]], as well as in the pattern of scales in [[pine cones]], where multiple spirals run both clockwise and anticlockwise. These arrangements have explanations at different levels – mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology – each individually correct, but all necessary together.{{sfn|Ball|2009|page=13}} Phyllotaxis spirals can be generated mathematically from [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci ratios]]: the Fibonacci sequence runs 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... (each subsequent number being the sum of the two preceding ones). For example, when leaves alternate up a stem, one rotation of the spiral touches two leaves, so the pattern or ratio is 1/2. In [[hazel]] the ratio is 1/3; in [[apricot]] it is 2/5; in [[pear]] it is 3/8; in [[almond]] it is 5/13.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to geometry|first=H. S. M. |last=Coxeter|author-link =Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|publisher =Wiley|date=1961|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; In disc phyllotaxis as in the [[sunflower]] and [[Bellis perennis|daisy]], the florets are arranged in [[Fermat's spiral]] with Fibonacci numbering, at least when the flowerhead is mature so all the elements are the same size. Fibonacci ratios approximate the [[golden angle]], 137.508°, which governs the curvature of Fermat's spiral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Prusinkiewicz | first =Przemyslaw | authorlink =Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz |author2=Lindenmayer, Aristid |authorlink2=Aristid Lindenmayer | title =The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants | publisher =Springer-Verlag | date =1990 | pages =101–107 | url =http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/#webdocs | isbn = 978-0-387-97297-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the point of view of physics, spirals are lowest-energy configurations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Levitov LS |title=Energetic Approach to Phyllotaxis |journal=Europhys.

Phyllotaxis is controlled by [[protein]]s that manipulate the concentration of the plant hormone [[auxin]], which activates [[meristem]] growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the relative angle of buds around the stem.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=163, 249–250}} From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name=Kappraff/&gt;

In mathematics, a [[dynamical system]] is chaotic if it is (highly) sensitive to initial conditions (the so-called "[[butterfly effect]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lorenz|first=Edward N. |authorlink=Edward Norton Lorenz |title=Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences |date=March 1963 |volume=20|issue=2 |pages=130–141| doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020&lt;0130:DNF&gt;2.0.CO;2| bibcode = 1963JAtS...20..130L}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which requires the mathematical properties of [[topological mixing]] and [[dense set|dense]] [[periodic orbits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Elaydi, Saber N. |title=Discrete Chaos |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC |date=1999 |page=117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside fractals, [[chaos theory]] ranks as an essentially universal influence on patterns in nature. There is a relationship between chaos and fractals—the ''[[strange attractors]]'' in chaotic systems have a [[fractal dimension]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruelle, David. ''Chance and Chaos''. Princeton University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[cellular automata]], simple sets of mathematical rules that generate patterns, have chaotic behaviour, notably [[Stephen Wolfram]]'s [[Rule 30]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, Stephen. ''[[A New Kind of Science]]''. Wolfram Media, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vortex street]]s are zigzagging patterns of whirling [[Vortex|vortices]] created by the unsteady [[flow separation|separation of flow]] of a [[fluid]], most often air or water, over obstructing objects.&lt;ref&gt;von Kármán, Theodore. ''Aerodynamics''. McGraw-Hill (1963): {{isbn|978-0070676022}}. Dover (1994): {{isbn|978-0486434858}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smooth ([[Laminar flow|laminar]]) flow starts to break up when the size of the obstruction or the velocity of the flow become large enough compared to the [[viscosity]] of the fluid.

[[Meander]]s are sinuous bends in rivers or other channels, which form as a fluid, most often water, flows around bends. As soon as the path is slightly curved, the size and curvature of each loop increases as [[helical flow]] drags material like sand and gravel across the river to the inside of the bend. The outside of the loop is left clean and unprotected, so [[erosion]] accelerates, further increasing the meandering in a powerful [[positive feedback loop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jacques | last=Lewalle | title=Lecture Notes in Incompressible Fluid Dynamics: Phenomenology, Concepts and Analytical Tools | chapter=Flow Separation and Secondary Flow: Section 9.1 | chapter-url=http://www.ecs.syr.edu/faculty/lewalle/FluidDynamics/fluidsCh9.pdf | date=2006 | location=Syracuse, NY | publisher=Syracuse University | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929075022/http://www.ecs.syr.edu/faculty/lewalle/FluidDynamics/fluidsCh9.pdf | archivedate=2011-09-29 | df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waves, dunes ===

[[Wave]]s are disturbances that carry energy as they move. [[Mechanical wave]]s propagate through a medium – air or water, making it [[Oscillation|oscillate]] as they pass by.&lt;ref&gt;French, A.P. ''Vibrations and Waves''. Nelson Thornes, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wind wave]]s are sea [[surface wave]]s that create the characteristic chaotic pattern of any large body of water, though their statistical behaviour can be predicted with wind wave models.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=H.L. | last=Tolman | contribution=Practical wind wave modeling | title=CBMS Conference Proceedings on Water Waves: Theory and Experiment | date=2008 | location=Howard University, USA, 13–18 May 2008 | publisher=World Scientific Publ. | url=http://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/mmab/papers/tn270/Howard_08.pdf | editor-first=M.F. | editor-last=Mahmood}}&lt;/ref&gt; As waves in water or wind pass over sand, they create patterns of ripples. When winds blow over large bodies of sand, they create [[dune]]s, sometimes in extensive dune fields as in the [[Taklamakan]] desert. Dunes may form a range of patterns including crescents, very long straight lines, stars, domes, parabolas, and longitudinal or seif ('sword') shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/dunes/ | title=Types of Dunes | publisher=USGS | date=29 October 1997 | accessdate=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barchan]]s or crescent dunes are produced by wind acting on desert sand; the two horns of the crescent and the [[slip face]] point downwind. Sand blows over the upwind face, which stands at about 15 degrees from the horizontal, and falls onto the slip face, where it accumulates up to the [[angle of repose]] of the sand, which is about 35 degrees. When the slip face exceeds the angle of repose, the sand [[avalanche]]s, which is a [[nonlinear]] behaviour: the addition of many small amounts of sand causes nothing much to happen, but then the addition of a further small amount suddenly causes a large amount to avalanche.&lt;ref&gt;Strahler, A. &amp; Archibold, O.W. ''Physical Geography: Science and Systems of the Human Environment''. John Wiley, 4th edition 2008. Page 442.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from this nonlinearity, barchans behave rather like [[soliton|solitary waves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Schwämmle, V. | author2=Herrman, H.J. | title=Solitary wave behaviour of sand dunes| journal=Nature | volume=426 | issue=Dec. 11 | date=2003 | pages=619–620 [https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/426619a Abstract] | doi=10.1038/426619a | pmid=14668849|bibcode = 2003Natur.426..619S }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bubbles, foam===

A [[soap bubble]] forms a [[sphere]], a [[minimal surface|surface with minimal area]] — the smallest possible surface area for the volume enclosed. Two bubbles together form a more complex shape: the outer surfaces of both bubbles are spherical; these surfaces are joined by a third spherical surface as the smaller bubble bulges slightly into the larger one.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=108–109}}

A [[foam]] is a mass of bubbles; foams of different materials occur in nature. Foams composed of [[soap film]]s obey [[Plateau's laws]], which require three soap films to meet at each edge at 120° and four soap edges to meet at each vertex at the [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] angle of about 109.5°. Plateau's laws further require films to be smooth and continuous, and to have a constant [[mean curvature|average curvature]] at every point. For example, a film may remain nearly flat on average by being curved up in one direction (say, left to right) while being curved downwards in another direction (say, front to back).{{sfn|Ball|2009|page=68}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick J. Almgren, Jr.]] and [[Jean E. Taylor]], ''The geometry of soap films and soap bubbles'', Scientific American, vol. 235, pp. 82–93, July 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Structures with minimal surfaces can be used as tents. [[Lord Kelvin]] identified the problem of the most efficient way to pack cells of equal volume as a foam in 1887; his solution uses just one solid, the [[bitruncated cubic honeycomb]] with very slightly curved faces to meet Plateau's laws. No better solution was found until 1993 when Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan proposed the [[Weaire–Phelan structure]]; the [[Beijing National Aquatics Center]] adapted the structure for their outer wall in the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=73–76}}

At the scale of living [[cell (biology)|cells]], foam patterns are common; [[radiolarian]]s, [[sponge]] [[spicule (sponge)|spicule]]s, [[silicoflagellate]] [[exoskeleton]]s and the calcite skeleton of a [[sea urchin]], ''[[Cidaris rugosa]]'', all resemble mineral casts of Plateau foam boundaries.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=96–101}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/indexmag.html?http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/artfeb05/cbdiatoms.html | title=Geometry and Pattern in Nature 3: The holes in radiolarian and diatom tests | publisher=Microscopy-UK | date=February 2005 | accessdate=May 28, 2012 | author=Brodie, Christina}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skeleton of the [[Radiolarian]], ''Aulonia hexagona'', a beautiful marine form drawn by [[Ernst Haeckel]], looks as if it is a sphere composed wholly of hexagons, but this is mathematically impossible. The [[Euler characteristic]] states that for any [[convex polyhedron]], the number of faces plus the number of vertices (corners) equals the number of edges plus two. A result of this formula is that any closed polyhedron of hexagons has to include exactly 12 pentagons, like a [[Euler characteristic#Soccer ball|soccer ball]], [[Buckminster Fuller]] [[geodesic dome]], or [[fullerene]] molecule. This can be visualised by noting that a mesh of hexagons is flat like a sheet of chicken wire, but each pentagon that is added forces the mesh to bend (there are fewer corners, so the mesh is pulled in).{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=51–54}}

=== Tessellations ===
{{main|tessellation}}

[[Tessellation]]s are patterns formed by repeating [[tile]]s all over a flat surface. There are 17 [[wallpaper group]]s of tilings.&lt;ref name=armstrong&gt;{{cite book | last=Armstrong | first=M.A. | title=Groups and Symmetry | date=1988 | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; While common in art and design, exactly repeating tilings are less easy to find in living things. The cells in the paper nests of social [[wasp]]s, and the wax cells in [[honeycomb]] built by honey bees are well-known examples. Among animals, bony fish, reptiles or the [[pangolin]], or fruits like the [[salak]] are protected by overlapping scales or [[osteoderms]], these form more-or-less exactly repeating units, though often the scales in fact vary continuously in size. Among flowers, the snake's head fritillary, ''[[Fritillaria meleagris]]'', have a tessellated chequerboard pattern on their petals. The structures of [[minerals]] provide good examples of regularly repeating three-dimensional arrays. Despite the hundreds of thousands of known minerals, there are rather few possible types of arrangement of atoms in a [[crystal]], defined by [[crystal structure]], [[crystal system]], and [[point group]]; for example, there are exactly 14 [[Bravais lattices]] for the 7 lattice systems in three-dimensional space.&lt;ref name="Solid State Physics 2010"&gt;Hook, J.R.; Hall, H.E.

=== Cracks ===

[[Fracture|Cracks]] are linear openings that form in materials to relieve [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]]. When an [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] material stretches or shrinks uniformly, it eventually reaches its breaking strength and then fails suddenly in all directions, creating cracks with 120 degree joints, so three cracks meet at a node. Conversely, when an inelastic material fails, straight cracks form to relieve the stress. Further stress in the same direction would then simply open the existing cracks; stress at right angles can create new cracks, at 90 degrees to the old ones. Thus the pattern of cracks indicates whether the material is elastic or not.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=207}} In a tough fibrous material like oak tree bark, cracks form to relieve stress as usual, but they do not grow long as their growth is interrupted by bundles of strong elastic fibres. Since each species of tree has its own structure at the levels of cell and of molecules, each has its own pattern of splitting in its bark.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=208}}

===Spots, stripes===

Leopards and ladybirds are spotted; angelfish and zebras are striped.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=156–158}} These patterns have an [[evolution]]ary explanation: they have [[Function (biology)|functions]] which increase the chances that the offspring of the patterned animal will survive to reproduce. One function of animal patterns is [[camouflage]];&lt;ref name=DarwinCh4/&gt; for instance, a [[leopard]] that is harder to see catches more prey. Another function is [[Signalling theory|signalling]]&lt;ref name=Wickler/&gt; — for instance, a [[ladybird]] is less likely to be attacked by [[predator]]y birds that hunt by sight, if it has bold warning colours, and is also [[Aposematism|distastefully bitter or poisonous]], or [[Mimicry|mimics]] other distasteful insects. A young bird may see a warning patterned insect like a ladybird and try to eat it, but it will only do this once; very soon it will spit out the bitter insect; the other ladybirds in the area will remain undisturbed. The young leopards and ladybirds, inheriting [[gene]]s that somehow create spottedness, survive. But while these evolutionary and functional arguments explain why these animals need their patterns, they do not explain how the patterns are formed.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=156–158}}

===Pattern formation===
{{main|Pattern formation}}

Alan Turing,&lt;ref name=Turing/&gt; and later the mathematical biologist [[James D. Murray|James Murray]],&lt;ref name="Murray2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=James D.|title=Mathematical Biology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3LmCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA436|date=9 March 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-662-08539-4|pages=436–450}}&lt;/ref&gt; described a mechanism that spontaneously creates spotted or striped patterns: a [[reaction-diffusion]] system.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=159–167}} The cells of a young organism have genes that can be switched on by a chemical signal, a [[morphogen]], resulting in the growth of a certain type of structure, say a darkly pigmented patch of skin. If the morphogen is present everywhere, the result is an even pigmentation, as in a black leopard. But if it is unevenly distributed, spots or stripes can result. Turing suggested that there could be [[feedback]] control of the production of the morphogen itself. This could cause continuous fluctuations in the amount of morphogen as it diffused around the body. A second mechanism is needed to create [[standing wave]] patterns (to result in spots or stripes): an inhibitor chemical that switches off production of the morphogen, and that itself diffuses through the body more quickly than the morphogen, resulting in an activator-inhibitor scheme. The [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction]] is a non-biological example of this kind of scheme, a [[chemical oscillator]].{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=159–167}}

Later research has managed to create convincing models of patterns as diverse as zebra stripes, giraffe blotches, jaguar spots (medium-dark patches surrounded by dark broken rings) and ladybird shell patterns (different geometrical layouts of spots and stripes, see illustrations).{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=168–180}} [[Richard Prum]]'s activation-inhibition models, developed from Turing's work, use six variables to account for the observed range of nine basic within-feather pigmentation patterns, from the simplest, a central pigment patch, via concentric patches, bars, chevrons, eye spot, pair of central spots, rows of paired spots and an array of dots.{{sfn|Rothenberg|2011|pages=93–95}}&lt;ref name=Prum/&gt;{{rp|6}} More elaborate models simulate complex feather patterns in the guineafowl ''[[Numida meleagris]]'' in which the individual feathers feature transitions from bars at the base to an array of dots at the far (distal) end. These require an oscillation created by two inhibiting signals, with interactions in both space and time.&lt;ref name=Prum&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.yale.edu/eeb/prum/pdf/Prum%20&amp;%20Williamson%202002.pdf | title=Reaction–diffusion models of within-feather pigmentation patterning | author=Prum, Richard O. |author1link=Richard Prum | author2=Williamson, Scott | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B | date=2002 | volume=269 | issue=1493 | pages=781–792 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2001.1896| pmid=11958709 | pmc=1690965 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7–8}}

Patterns can form for other reasons in the [[patterned vegetation|vegetated landscape]] of [[tiger bush]]&lt;ref name=TigerBush&gt;{{cite book | title=Banded vegetation patterning in arid and semiarid environments | publisher=Springer-Verlag | author=Tongway, D.J. | author2=Valentin, C. | author3=Seghieri, J. | last-author-amp=yes | date=2001 | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[fir wave]]s.&lt;ref name=FirWave&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tiee.esa.org/vol/v1/figure_sets/disturb/disturb_back4.html | title=Fir Waves: Regeneration in New England Conifer Forests | publisher=TIEE | date=22 February 2004 | accessdate=26 May 2012 | author=D'Avanzo, C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tiger bush stripes occur on arid slopes where plant growth is limited by rainfall. Each roughly horizontal stripe of vegetation effectively collects the rainwater from the bare zone immediately above it.&lt;ref name=TigerBush/&gt; Fir waves occur in forests on mountain slopes after wind disturbance, during regeneration. When trees fall, the trees that they had sheltered become exposed and are in turn more likely to be damaged, so gaps tend to expand downwind. Meanwhile, on the windward side, young trees grow, protected by the wind shadow of the remaining tall trees.&lt;ref name=FirWave/&gt; Natural patterns are sometimes formed by animals, as in the [[Mima mounds]] of the Northwestern United States and some other areas, which appear to be created over many years by the burrowing activities of [[pocket gopher]]s,&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news |last=Morelle |first=Rebecca |title='Digital gophers' solve Mima mound mystery |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25259133 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=9 December 2013|date=2013-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the so-called [[fairy circle]]s of Namibia appear to be created by the interaction of competing groups of sand termites, along with competition for water among the desert plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sample|first1=Ian|title=The secret of Namibia's 'fairy circles' may be explained at last|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jan/18/the-secret-of-namibias-fairy-circles-may-be-explained-at-last|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=18 January 2017|date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In permafrost soils with an active upper layer subject to annual freeze and thaw, [[patterned ground]] can form, creating circles, nets, [[ice wedge]] polygons, steps, and stripes. [[Thermal contraction]] causes shrinkage cracks to form; in a thaw, water fills the cracks, expanding to form ice when next frozen, and widening the cracks into wedges. These cracks may join up to form polygons and other shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Permafrost: Patterned Ground |url=http://permafrosttunnel.crrel.usace.army.mil/permafrost/patterned_ground.html |publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers |accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[gyrification|fissured pattern]] that develops on vertebrate brains are caused by a physical process of constrained expansion dependent on two geometric parameters: relative tangential cortical expansion and relative thickness of the [[cerebellar cortex|cortex]]. Similar patterns of [[Gyrus|gyri]] (peaks) and [[Sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulci]] (troughs) have been demonstrated in models of the brain starting from smooth, layered gels, with the patterns caused by compressive mechanical forces resulting from the expansion of the outer layer (representing the cortex) after the addition of a solvent. Numerical models in computer simulations support natural and experimental observations that the surface folding patterns increase in larger brains.&lt;ref name="Scientific American"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/human-brain-s-bizarre-folding-pattern-re-created-in-a-vat/|last1=Ghose|first1=Tia|title=Human Brain's Bizarre Folding Pattern Re-Created in a Vat|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PNAS"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tallinen|first1=Tuoma|last2=Chung|first2=Jun Young|last3=Biggins|first3= John S.|last4=Mahadevan|first4=L.|title=Gyrification from constrained cortical expansion|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=111|issue=35|pages=12667–12672|date=2014|doi=10.1073/pnas.1406015111|pmid=25136099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Biodiversity}}
A '''natural landscape''' is the original landscape that exists before it is acted upon by human culture.&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The area prior to the introduction of man 's activity is represented by one body of morphologic facts. The forms that man has introduced are another set. We may call the former, with reference to man, the original, natural landscape. In its entirety it no longer exists in many parts of the world, but its reconstruction and understanding are the first part of formal morphonology." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'', vol. 2, No. 2, 12 October 1925, p. 37.[https://archive.org/stream/universityofc02univ/universityofc02univ_djvu.txt]&lt;/ref&gt; The natural landscape and the [[cultural landscape]] are separate parts of the [[landscape]].&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The cultural landscape is fashioned from a natural landscape by a culture group. Culture is the agent, the natural area is the medium, the cultural landscape the result." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape", p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the twenty-first century landscapes that are totally untouched by human activity no longer exist, so that reference is sometimes now made to degrees of naturalness within a landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;The [[European Environment Agency]]'s planned forest naturalness index is an example of an attempt to define one type of natural landscape in Europe. The Agency lists forests in three categories: (1) [[Plantations]]; (2) Semi-natural; and (3) Naturally dynamic. The latter are "forests whose structure, composition and function have been shaped by natural dynamics without substantial [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] influence over a long period of time".&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962) [[Rachel Carson]] describes a roadside verge as it used to look: "Along the roads, laurel, viburnum and alder, great ferns and wildflowers delighted the traveler’s eye through much of the year" and then how it looks now following the use of [[herbicide]]s: "The roadsides, once so attractive, were now lined with browned and withered vegetation as though swept by fire".&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge, Mass.: Riverside Press, 1962, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the landscape before it is sprayed is biologically degraded, and may well contains alien species, the concept of what might constitute a natural landscape can still be deduced from the context.

The phrase "natural landscape" was first used in connection with [[landscape painting]], and [[landscape gardening]], to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, closer to nature. [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1769 – 1859) was to further conceptualize this into the idea of a natural landscape ''separate'' from the [[cultural landscape]]. Then in 1908 [[geographer]] [[Otto Schlüter]] developed the terms original landscape (''Urlandschaft'') and its opposite cultural landscape (''Kulturlandschaft'') in an attempt to give the science of geography a subject matter that was different from the other sciences. An early use of the actual phrase "natural landscape" by a [[geographer]] can be found in  [[Carl O. Sauer]]'s paper "The Morphology of Landscape" (1925).&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl O. Sauer]], "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'' 2 (2), pp. 19-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the term==
The concept of a natural landscape was first developed in connection with [[landscape painting]], though the actual term itself was first used in relation to [[landscape gardening]]. In both cases it was used to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, that is closer to nature. Chunglin Kwa suggests, "that a seventeenth-century or early-eighteenth-century person could experience natural scenery ‘just like on a painting,’ and so, with or without the use of the word itself, designate it as a landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Chunglin Kwa, "Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape", ''The European Legacy'', Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to landscape gardening John Aikin, commented in 1794: "Whatever, therefore, there be of ''novelty'' in the singular scenery of an artificial garden, it is soon exhausted, whereas the infinite diversity of a natural landscape presents an inexhaustible flore of new forms".&lt;ref&gt;J. Aikin, M.D., ''Letters from a Father to His Son, on Various Topics, Relative to Literature and the Conduct of Life. Written in the Years 1792 and 1793'',  (Philadelphia:  Samuel Harrison Smith), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1844 the prominent American landscape gardener [[Andrew Jackson Downing]] comments: "straight canals, round or oblong pieces of water, and all the regular forms of the geometric mode ... would evidently be in violent opposition to the whole character and expression of natural landscape".&lt;ref&gt;''A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening Adapted to North America''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his extensive travels in South America, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] became the first to conceptualize a natural landscape separate from the cultural landscape, though he does not actually use these terms.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/qnct310.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/cele/2005/00000010/00000002/art00002 Chunglin Kwa, Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape, The European Legacy, Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://www.avhumboldt.net/humboldt/publications/paragraph/did/35/vid/38/cid/244/tid/7698/text/The-description-of-nature-in-its-manifold-richness-of-form-as-a-distinct-branch-of-poetic-literat] "The description of nature in its manifold richness of form, as a distinct branch of poetic literature, was wholly unknown to the Greeks. The landscape appears among them merely as the basil-ground of the picture of which human figures constitute the main subject. Passions, breaking forth into action, riveted their attention almost exclusively." Alexander von Humboldt ''[[Cosmos: a sketch of a physical description of the universe]]'' (translation 1804), Volume 2, Part I, Paragraph 5, Chapter I.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Jackson Downing was aware of, and sympathetic to, Humboldt's ideas, which therefore influenced American landscape gardening.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Horticulturist'', vol.4, no.2, August 1849, which Downing edited.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the [[geographer]] [[Otto Schlüter]], in 1908, argued that by defining [[geography]] as a ''Landschaftskunde'' (landscape science) would give geography a logical subject matter shared by no other discipline.&lt;ref&gt;James, P.E &amp; Martin, G (1981) ''All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York, p.177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, T.H (1989) ''Human and Regional Geography in the German-speaking lands in the first forty years of the Twentieth Century''. Entriken, J. Nicholas &amp; Brunn, Stanley D (Eds) ''Reflections on Richard Hartshorne's The nature of geography''. Occasional publications of the Association of the American Geographers, Washington DC., p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He defined two forms of landscape: the ''Urlandschaft'' (original landscape) or landscape that existed before major human induced changes and the ''Kulturlandschaft'' (cultural landscape) a landscape created by human culture. Schlüter argued that the major task of geography was to trace the changes in these two landscapes.

The term natural landscape is sometimes used as a synonym for [[wilderness]], but for geographers natural landscape is a scientific term which refers to the [[biological]], [[geological]], [[Climatology|climatological]] and other aspects of a landscape, not the cultural values that are implied by the word wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;"The Trouble with Wilderness; or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature". William Cronon, ed., ''Uncommon Ground: Rethinking the Human Place in Nature''. (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1995), pp. 69–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The natural and conservation===
Matters are complicated by the fact that the words nature and natural have more than one meaning. On the one hand there is the main dictionary meaning for nature: "The phenomena of the physical world collectively, including plants, animals, the landscape, and other features and products of the earth, as opposed to humans or human creations".&lt;ref&gt;"Nature", ''New Oxford American Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there is the growing awareness, especially since [[Charles Darwin]], of humanities biological affinity with nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.seattlepi.com/animals-share-human-dna-sequences-6693.html "Animals That Share Human DNA Sequences", Seattlepi.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] of the first definition has its roots is an "ancient concept", because early people viewed "nature, or the nonhuman world […] as a divine ''Other'', godlike in its separation from humans".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), p. 14. They cite William Conron's 1995 essay "The Trouble with Wilderness: or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature".&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Western culture|West]], Christianity's myth of [[The fall of man|the fall]], that is the expulsion of humankind from the [[Garden of Eden]], where all creation lived in harmony, into an imperfect world, has been the major influence.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Vining, Melinda Merrick and Emily Price, "The Distinction between Humans and Nature". ''Human Ecology Review'', vol.15, no. 1, 2008, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cartesian dualism]], from the seventeenth century on,  further reinforced this dualistic thinking about nature.&lt;ref&gt;Vining, Merrick and Price, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; 
With this [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] goes value judgement as to [[appeal to nature|the superiority of the natural over the artificial]]. Modern science, however, is moving towards a [[holistic]] view of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Kaika, ''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

====America====
What is meant by natural, within the American [[conservation movement]], has been changing over the last century and a half.

In the mid-nineteenth century American began to realize that the land was becoming more and more domesticated and wildlife was disappearing. This led to the creation of [[National Park Service|American National Parks]] and other conservation sites.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially it was believed that all that was needed to do was to separate what was seen as natural landscape and "avoid disturbances such as logging, grazing, fire and insect outbreaks".&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; This, and subsequent environmental policy, until recently, was influenced by ideas of the wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;William Cronon, pp. 72-77&lt;/ref&gt; However, this policy was not consistently applied, and in [[Yellowstone Park]], to take one example, the existing ecology was altered, firstly by the exclusion of Native Americans and later with the virtual extermination of the wolf population.&lt;ref name="dow"&gt;{{cite web |title=Defenders of Wildlife |work=A Yellowstone Chronology |url=http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |accessdate=2007-03-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607214843/http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |archivedate=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref{{cite book |last=Merchant |first=Carolyn |title=The Columbia Guide to American Environmental History |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-231-11232-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QQQximQsxSgC |page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A century later, in the mid-twentieth century, it began to be believed that the earlier policy of "protection from disturbance was inadequate to preserve park values", and that is that direct human intervention was necessary to restore the landscape of National Parks to its ‘’natural’’ condition.&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"/&gt; In 1963 the [[Leopold Report]] argued that "A national park should represent a vignette of primitive America".&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This policy change eventually led to the restoration of [[History of wolves in Yellowstone|wolves in Yellowstone Park]] in the 1990s.

However, recent research in various disciplines indicates that a pristine natural or "primitive" landscape is a myth, and it now realised that people have been changing the natural into a cultural landscape for a long while, and that there are few places untouched in some way from human influence.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier conservation policies were now seen as cultural interventions. The idea of what is natural and what artificial or cultural, and how to maintain the natural elements in a landscape, has been further complicated by the discovery of [[global warming]] and how it is changing natural landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Also important is a reaction recently amongst scholars against dualistic thinking about nature and culture. Maria Kaika comments: "Nowadays, we are beginning to see nature and culture as intertwined once again – not [[ontologically]] separated anymore […].What I used to perceive as a compartmentalized world, consisting of neatly and tightly sealed, autonomous ‘space envelopes’ (the home, the city, and nature) was, in fact, a messy socio-spatial continuum”.&lt;ref&gt;''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; And William Cronon argues against the idea of wilderness because it "involves a dualistic vision in which the human is entirely outside the natural"&lt;ref&gt;Cronon, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and affirms that "wildness (as opposed to wilderness) can be found anywhere" even "in the cracks of a Manhattan sidewalk".&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"&gt;Cronon, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cronon we have to "abandon the dualism that sees the tree in the garden as artificial […] and the tree in the wilderness as natural […] Both in some ultimate sense are wild."&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"/&gt; Here he bends somewhat the regular dictionary meaning of wild, to emphasise that nothing natural, even in a garden, is fully under human control.

====Europe====
The landscape of Europe has considerably altered by people and even in an area, like the [[Cairngorm Mountains]] of [[Scotland]], with a low population density, only " the high summits of the [[Cairngorm Mountains]], consist entirely of natural elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snh.gov.uk/about-scotlands-nature/scotlands-landscapes/what-is-landscape/  [[Scottish Natural Heritage]], ]&lt;/ref&gt; These ''high summits'' are of course only part of the Cairngorms, and there are no longer wolves, bears, wild boar or lynx in Scotland's wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/6155172.stm | title = Extinct Island Pig Spotted Again | publisher = BBC News | date = 17 November 2006 | accessdate =1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraser Darling and Boyd 1969 64"&gt;Fraser Darling and Boyd (1969) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scots pine]] in the form of the [[Caledonian forest]] also covered much more of the Scottish landscape than today.&lt;ref&gt;Steven, H. M. &amp; Carlisle, A. (1959). ''The Native Pinewoods of Scotland''. Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Swiss National Park]], however, represent a more natural landscape. It was founded in 1914, and is one of the earliest national parks in Europe.
Visitors are not allowed to leave the motor road, or paths through the park, make [[fire]] or camp. The only building within the park is Chamanna Cluozza, [[mountain hut]]. It is also forbidden to disturb the [[animals]] or the [[plants]], or to take home anything found in the park. Dogs are not allowed. Due to these strict rules, the Swiss National Park is the only park in the Alps who has been categorized by the [[IUCN]] as a [[strict nature reserve]], which is the highest protection level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=SWI+01&amp;mode=all Parc Suisse Biosphere Reserve]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of natural landscape==
No place on the Earth is unaffected by people and their culture. People are part of [[biodiversity]], but human activity affects biodiversity, and this alters the natural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html National Survey Reveals Biodiversity Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607101209/http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html |date=7 June 2007 }} American Museum of Natural History&lt;/ref&gt; Mankind have altered landscape to such an extent that few places on earth remain pristine, but once free of human influences, the landscape can return to a natural or near natural state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4uDb0H4V5c YouTube, Professor James Lovelock, We can't save the planet, BBC NEWS, 2010/03/30]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wrangell St. Elias National Park.jpg|thumb| [[Glacier]] on the border between [[Alaska]], US, and Canada: [[Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek]] park system]]
Even the remote [[Yukon]] and [[Alaskan]] wilderness, the bi-national [[Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek]] park system comprising [[Kluane National Park|Kluane]], [[Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve|Wrangell-St Elias]], [[Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve|Glacier Bay]] and [[Tatshenshini-Alsek Park|Tatshenshini-Alsek]] parks, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], is not free from human influence, because the [[Kluane National Park]] lies within the traditional territories of the Champagne and Aishihik [[First Nations]] and [[Kluane First Nation]] who have a long history of living in this region. Through their respective Final Agreements with the Canadian Government, they have made into law their rights to harvest in this region.

==Examples of cultural forces==
Cultural forces intentionally or unintentionally, have an influence upon the landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://lamar.colostate.edu/%7Ehrolston/Technol-vs-Nature-Aberdeen.pdf "It is true that certain human technological actions do have unintended consequences that spread everywhere; there are contagious effects that seep into the nooks and crannies of all nature." Holmes Rolston III, "Technology versus nature, What is natural, Journal of Philosophy and Technology", ''Ends and Means'', Vol 2 No.2 Spring 1998, University of Aberdeen, Edinburgh University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural landscapes]] are places or artifacts created and maintained by people. Examples of cultural intrusions into a landscape are: fences, roads, parking lots, sand pits, buildings, hiking trails, management of plants, including the introduction of [[invasive species]], extraction or removal of plants, management of animals, mining, hunting, [[natural landscaping]], farming and forestry, pollution. Areas that might be confused with a natural landscape include [[public park]]s, farms, orchards, artificial lakes and reservoirs, managed forests, golf courses, nature center trails, gardens.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7050">'''Aesthetics of nature''' is a sub-field of [[ethics|philosophical ethics]], and refers to the study of natural objects from their [[aesthetics|aesthetical]] perspective.

==History==
Aesthetics of nature developed as a sub-field of philosophical ethics. In the 18th and 19th century, the aesthetics of nature advanced the concepts of disinterestedness, the pictures, and the introduction of the idea of positive aesthetics.&lt;ref name=Carlson2012&gt;
{{cite book

  |title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy

  |accessdate=2 October 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first major developments of nature occurred in the 18th century. The concept of disinterestedness had been explained by many thinkers. [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley-Cooper]] introduced the concept as a way of characterizing the notion of the aesthetic, later magnified by [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], who expanded it to exclude personal and utilitarianism interests and associations of a more general nature from aesthetic experience.&lt;ref name=Stolnitz1961&gt;
{{cite journal
  |last=Stolnitz|first=J.
  |year=1961
  |title=Of the Origins of ‘Aesthetic Disinterestedness’
  |journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism
  |volume=20|pages=131–143
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This concept was further developed by [[Archibald Alison (author)|Archibald Alison]] who referred it to a particular state of mind.&lt;ref name=Stolnitz1961/&gt;

==Theories==
The theory of disinterestedness opened doors for a better understanding of the aesthetics dimensions of nature in terms of three conceptualizations: 
# The idea of beautiful: this applied to tamed and cultivated European gardens and landscapes&lt;ref name=Carlson2012/&gt;
# The idea of the sublime: this explained the threatening and terrifying side of nature such as mountains and wilderness; however, when it is viewed through the disinterestedness perspective, it can be aesthetically appreciated rather than feared or neglected&lt;ref name=Carlson2012/&gt;
# The notion of the picturesque: the term "picturesque" means "picture-like", where the natural world is experienced as if it is divided into art-like scenes&lt;ref name=Carlson2012/&gt;

Objects experienced as beautiful tend to be small, smooth, and fair in color.&lt;ref name=Conron2000&gt;
{{cite book
  |last=Conron|first=J.
  |year=2000
  |title=American Picturesque
  |location=University Park, Pennsylvania
  |publisher=[[Pennsylvania State University Press]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17–18}} In contrast, objects viewed as sublime tend to be powerful, intense and terrifying. Picturesque items are a mixture of both, which can be seen as varied and irregular, rich and forceful, and even vibrant.&lt;ref name=Conron2000/&gt;{{rp|17–18}}

==21st century developments==

Cognitive and non-cognitive approaches of nature have directed their focus from natural environments to the consideration of human and human influenced environments and developed aesthetic investigations of everyday life.(Carlson and Lintott, 2007; Parsons 2008a; Carlson 2010){{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==Human Perspectives and Relationship with Nature==
People may be mistaken by the [[objet d'art|art object]] analogy. For instance, a [[sandhill crane]] is not an art object; an art object is not a sandhill crane. In fact, an art object should be called an ''artifact''.&lt;ref name=Rolston2002&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crane is wildlife on its own and is not an art object. This can be related to Satio's definition of the cognitive view. In elaboration, the crane lives through various ecosystems such as Yellowstone. Nature is a living system which includes animals, plants, and Eco-systems. In contrast, an art object has no regeneration, evolutionary history, or metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;

As a characterization of the appreciation of art, nature aestheticists argue that post modernism is a mistaken view because we do not have a case of anything goes.The aesthetics appreciation of art is governed by some normative standards.&lt;ref name=Parsons2008/&gt; In the world of art, criticism may take place when people come together and discuss books and films or critics write appraisals for publications.

'''Physis''' (Greek: {{lang|grc|φύσις|italic=yes}} ''phusis'') is a Greek [[theology|theological]], [[philosophy|philosophical]], and [[science|scientific]] term usually translated into English as "[[nature (philosophy)|nature]]".

The term is central to [[Greek philosophy]], and as a consequence to [[Western philosophy]] as a whole.
In [[pre-Socratic]] usage, ''phusis'' was contrasted with {{lang|grc|νόμος}}, {{lang|lat|nomos}}, "law, human convention."
Since  [[Aristotle]], however, the ''physical'' (the subject matter of ''[[physics]]'', properly  {{lang|grc|τὰ φυσικά}} "natural things") has more typically  been juxtaposed to the ''[[metaphysics|metaphysical]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Discussed in Aristotle's works so titled, ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' "Physis, translated since the Third Century B.C. usually as "nature" and less frequently as "essence", means one thing for the presocratic philosophers and quite another thing for Plato." Welch, Kathleen Ethel. "Keywords from Classical Rhetoric: The Example of Physis." Rhetoric Society Quarterly 17.2 (1987): 193-204. Print.
The Pontifical Academy of Sciences. ''Evolving Concepts of Nature''. Proceedings of the Plenary Session, 24–28 October 2014, Acta 23, Vatican City, 2015. [http://www.casinapioiv.va/content/accademia/en/publications/acta/acta23.html link].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pre-socratic usage ==
The word φύσις is a verbal noun based on [[:wikt:φύω|φύω]] "to grow, to appear" ([[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/bʰuH-|cognate]] with English "to be"). In [[Homeric Greek]] it is used quite literally, of the manner of growth of a particular species of plant.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Odyssey]]'' 10.302-3:  {{lang|grc|ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας πόρε φάρμακον ἀργεϊφόντης ἐκ γαίης ἐρύσας, καί μοι '''φύσιν''' αὐτοῦ ἔδειξε}}. (So saying, Argeiphontes [=Hermes] gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed me its '''nature'''.) ''[[Odyssey]]''  (ed. A.T. Murray).&lt;/ref&gt;  

In [[pre-Socratic philosophers|pre-Socratic]] philosophy, beginning with [[Heraclitus]], ''phusis'' in keeping with its etymology of "growing, becoming" is always used in the sense of the "natural" ''development'', although the focus might lie either with the origin, or the process, or the end result of the process. There is some evidence that by the 6th century BC, beginning with the [[Ionian School (philosophy)|Ionian School]], the word could also be used 
in the comprehensive sense, as referring to "''all'' things", as it were "Nature" in the sense of "[[Universe]]".&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Naddaf, ''The Greek Concept of Nature'', SUNY Press, 2005, p. 3.
Guthrie, W. K. C., ''Presocratic Tradition from Parmenides to Democritus'' (volume 2 of his ''History of Greek Philosophy''), Cambridge UP, 1965.{{page needed|date=December 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Sophist]] tradition, the term stood in opposition to ''[[:wikt:nomos|nomos]]'' ({{lang|grc|νόμος}}), "[[law]]" or "[[convention (norm)|custom]]", in the debate on which parts of human existence are natural, and which are due to convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dunkie |first1=Roger |title=The Classical Origins of Western Culture: The Core Studies 1 Study Guide |url=http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/dunkle/studyguide/studygde.htm |accessdate=30 January 2012 |series=Brooklyn College Core Curriculum Series |date=1986 |publisher=[[Brooklyn College]] |location=[[Brooklyn, NY]]  |chapter=Philosophical background of the 5th Century B.C. |chapterurl=http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/dunkle/studyguide/sophists.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The contrast of ''phisis'' vs. ''[[:wikt:nomos|nomos]]'' could be applied to any subject, much like the modern contrast of "[[nature vs. nurture]]".

== In Plato's Laws ==
In book 10 of ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'', Plato criticizes those who write works ''peri phuseōs''. The criticism is that such authors tend to focus on a purely "naturalistic" explanation of the world, ignoring the role of "intention" or ''technē'', and thus becoming prone to the error of naive [[History_of_atheism#Classical_Greece_and_Rome|atheism]]. Plato accuses even [[Theogony|Hesiod]] of this, for the reason that the gods in Hesiod "grow" out of primordial entities after the physical universe had been established.&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Naddaf, ''The Greek Concept of Nature'' (2005), 1f.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Because those who use the term mean to say that nature is the first creative power; but if the soul turns out to be the primeval element, and not fire or air, then in the truest sense and beyond other things the soul may be said to exist ''by'' nature; and this would be true if you proved that the soul is older than the body, but not otherwise."
::— Plato's Laws, Book 10(892c) – ''translation by Benjamin Jowett''

== Aristotle ==
Aristotle sought out the definition of "physis" to prove that there was more than one definition of "physis", and more than one way to interpret nature. "Though Aristotle retains the ancient sense of "physis" as growth, he insists that an adequate definition of "physis" requires the different perspectives of the [[four causes]] (aitia): material, efficient, formal, and final."&lt;ref name="Rhetoric Reclaimed"&gt;Atwill, Janet. "The Interstices of Nature, Spontaneity, and Chance." Rhetoric Reclaimed: Aristotle and the Liberal Arts Tradition. Ithaca, NY: Cornell UP, 1998. N. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believed that nature itself contained its own source of matter (material), power/motion (efficiency), form, and end (final). A unique feature about Aristotle's definition of "physis" was his relationship between art and nature. Aristotle said that "physis" (nature) is dependent on [[techne]] (art). "The critical distinction between art and nature concerns their different efficient causes: nature is its own source of motion, whereas techne always requires a source of motion outside itself."&lt;ref name="Rhetoric Reclaimed" /&gt; What Aristotle was trying to bring to light, was that art does not contain within itself its form or source of motion. Consider the process of an acorn becoming an oak tree. This is a natural process that has its own driving force behind it. There is no external force pushing this acorn to its final state, rather it is progressively developing towards one specific end ([[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]).


==Biblical usage==
Though φύσις was often used in Hellenistic philosophy, it is used only 14 times in the New Testament (10 of those in the writings of Paul).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balz|first1=Horst Robert|title=Exegetical dictionary of the New Testament|publisher=[[William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company]]|location=Michigan1994|isbn=9780802828033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its meaning varies throughout Paul's writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Verbrugge|first1=Verlyn D.|title=New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology|date=2000|publisher=[[Zondervan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; One usage refers to the established or natural order of things, as in ''Romans 2:14'' where Paul writes "For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by ''nature'' do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Romans|2:14|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Danker|first1=Frederick W.|title=A Greek-English lexicon of the New Testament and other early Christian literature|date=2014|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another use of φύσις in the sense of "natural order" is ''Romans 1:26'' where he writes "the men likewise gave up ''natural'' relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another".&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Romans|1:26-1:27|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Danker|first1=Frederick W.|title=A Greek-English lexicon of the New Testament and other early Christian literature|date=2014|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''1 Corinthians 11:14'', Paul asks "Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is a disgrace for him?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Corinthians|11:13|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balz|first1=Horst Robert|title=Exegetical dictionary of the New Testament|publisher=William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company|location=Michigan1994|isbn=9780802828033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This use of φύσις as referring to a "natural order" in ''Romans 1:26'' and ''1 Corinthians 11:14''  may have been influenced by [[Stoicism]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Greek philosophers, including [[Aristotle]] and the Stoics are credited with distinguishing between man-made laws and a [[natural law]] of universal validity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=John|title=Oxford Dictionary of the Classical World|date=2007|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780192801463.001.0001/acref-9780192801463-e-1250.|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Gerhard Kittel]] states that the Stoic philosophers were not able to combine the concepts of νόμος (law) and φύσις (nature) to produce the concept of "natural law" in the sense that was made possible by [[Judeo-Christian]] theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kittel|first1=Gerhard|title=Theological Dictionary of the New Testament|publisher=Eerdman's Publishing Company|location=Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the [[Pauline Christianity|Pauline theology]] of [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] by [[Grace in Christianity|grace]], Paul writes in ''Ephesians 2:3'' that "we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by ''nature'' children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. In the next verse he writes, "by grace you have been saved." &lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Ephesians|2:3-2:4|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Verbrugge|first1=Verlyn D.|title=New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology|date=2000|publisher=Zondervan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage in patristic theology ==
Theologians of the early Christian period differed in the usage of this term. In [[School of Antioch|Antiochene]] circles, it connoted the humanity or divinity of Christ conceived as a concrete set of characteristics or attributes. In [[Alexandrian School|Alexandrine]] thinking, it meant a concrete individual or independent existent and approximated to [[hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasis]] without being a synonym.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, J.N.D. ''Early Christian Doctrines'' A&amp;C Black(1965) p.318&lt;/ref&gt;  While it refers to much the same thing as [[ousia]] it is more empirical and descriptive focussing on function while ousia is metaphysical and focuses more on reality.&lt;ref name="GiPT"&gt;Prestige, G.L. ''God in Patristic Thought'', SPCK (1964), p.234&lt;/ref&gt; Although found in the context of the [[Trinity|Trinitarian debate]], it is chiefly important in the [[Christology]] of [[Cyril of Alexandria]].&lt;ref name="GiPT"/&gt;

== Modern usage ==
The Greek adjective ''phusikos'' is represented  in various forms in modern English:
As ''[[physics]]'' "the study of nature", as ''[[:wikt:physical|physical]]'' (via Middle Latin ''physicalis'') referring both to physics (the study of nature, the material universe) and to the [[human body]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=physical |title=Physical |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |accessdate=20 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[physiology]] (''physiologia'') is of 16th-century coinage ([[Jean Fernel]]). The term ''physique'', for "the bodily constitution of a person", is a 19th-century loan from French. 

In medicine the suffix ''-physis'' occurs in such compounds as ''[[symphysis]]'', ''[[epiphysis]]'', and a few others, in the sense of "a growth". The physis also refers to the "[[Epiphyseal plate|growth plate]]", or site of growth at the end of long bones.

'''Ecosystem health''' is a metaphor used to describe the condition of an [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref name=rapport1998&gt;Rapport, David (1998). "Defining ecosystem health." Pages 18-33 in Rapport, D.J. (ed.) (1998). ''Ecosystem Health.'' Blackwell Scientific.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystem condition can vary as a result of fire, [[flooding]], [[drought]], [[extinction]]s, [[invasive species]], [[climate change]], [[mining]], [[overexploitation]] in [[fishing]], [[farming]] or [[logging]], [[chemical spill]]s, and a host of other reasons. There is no universally accepted benchmark for a healthy ecosystem,&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, David J. (1992). "Evaluating ecosystem health." ''Journal of aquatic ecosystem health'' 1:15-24&lt;/ref&gt; rather the apparent health status of an ecosystem can vary depending upon which health metrics are employed in judging it&lt;ref name=palmer2012&gt;Palmer, Margaret A. and Catherine M. Febria (2012). "The heartbeat of ecosystems." ''Science'' 336:1393-1394.&lt;/ref&gt; and which societal aspirations are driving the assessment. Advocates of the health metaphor argue for its simplicity as a communication tool. "Policy-makers and the public need simple, understandable concepts like health."&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Judy L. (1997). "Stream health: incorporating the human dimension to advance stream ecology." ''Journal of the North American Benthological Society'' 16:439^447&lt;/ref&gt; Critics worry that ecosystem health, a "value-laden construct", is often "passed off as science to unsuspecting policy makers and the public."&lt;ref&gt;Lackey, Robert T. (2007). "Science, scientists, and policy advocacy." ''Conservation Biology.'' 21(1): 12-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
== History of the concept ==

The health metaphor applied to the environment has been in use at least since the early 1800s&lt;ref&gt;Anon (1816). "Rural economy, agricultur
" ''[[Encyclopaedia Perthensis]]'' Volume 19, 391-497. Edinburgh: John Brown.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anon (1839). "On the culture of potatoes". ''Framer's Magazine, '' 2(5):337-338.&lt;/ref&gt; and the great American conservationist [[Aldo Leopold]] (1887–1948) spoke metaphorically of land health, land sickness, mutilation, and violence when describing land use practices.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, Aldo (1946). "The land health concept and conservation." Pages 218-226 in Callicott, J. Baird, and Eric T.Freyfogle. (1999) ''For the Health of the Land. '' Washington DC: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "ecosystem management" has been in use at least since the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Lutz, H.J. (1957). "Applications of ecology in forest management." ''Ecology'' 38:46-64.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "ecosystem health" has become widespread in the ecological literature, as a general metaphor meaning something good,&lt;ref name=Jax2010&gt;Jax, Kurt. (2010). ''Ecosystem Functioning.'' Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and as an environmental quality goal in field assessments of rivers,&lt;ref&gt;Davies, P.E. et al. (2010). "The Sustainable Rivers Audit: assessing river ecosystem health in the Murray–Darling Basin, Australia." ''Marine and Freshwater Research'' 61:764–777.&lt;/ref&gt; lakes,&lt;ref&gt;Xu, F, ZF Yang, B. Chen, and Y.W. Zhao. (2012). "Ecosystem Health Assessment of Baiyangdian Lake Based on Thermodynamic Indicators." ''Procedia Environmental Sciences'' 12: 2402–2413.&lt;/ref&gt; seas,&lt;ref&gt;HELCOM  (2010). ''Ecosystem health of the Baltic Sea 2003–2007'' HELCOM Initial Holistic Assessment.Balt. Sea Environ. Proc. No. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; and forests.&lt;ref&gt;Covington, W. Wallace et al. (1997) "Restoring Ecosystem Health in Ponderosa Pine Forests of the Southwest." ''Journal of Forestry'' 95:23-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently however this metaphor has been subject of quantitative formulation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramírez-Carrillo|first=Elvia|last2=López-Corona|first2=Oliver|last3=Toledo-Roy|first3=Juan C.|last4=Lovett|first4=Jon C.|last5=León-González|first5=Fernando de|last6=Osorio-Olvera|first6=Luis|last7=Equihua|first7=Julian|last8=Robredo|first8=Everardo|last9=Frank|first9=Alejandro|date=2018-07-16|title=Assessing sustainability in North America's ecosystems using criticality and information theory|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=13|issue=7|pages=e0200382|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0200382|pmid=30011317|pmc=6047788|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; using complex systems concepts such as criticality, meaning that a healthy ecosystem is in some sort of balance between adaptability (randomness) and robustness (order) . Nevertheless the universality of criticality is still under examination and is known as the Criticality Hypothesis, which states that systems in a dynamic regime shifting between order and disorder, attain the highest level of computational capabilities and achieve an optimal trade-off between robustness and flexibility. Recent results in cell and evolutionary biology, neuroscience and computer science have great interest in the criticality hypothesis, emphasizing its role as a viable candidate general law in the realm of adaptive complex systems (see &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roli|first=Andrea|last2=Villani|first2=Marco|last3=Filisetti|first3=Alessandro|last4=Serra|first4=Roberto|date=2017-11-17|title=Dynamical Criticality: Overview and Open Questions|journal=Journal of Systems Science and Complexity|volume=31|issue=3|pages=647–663|doi=10.1007/s11424-017-6117-5|issn=1009-6124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and references therein).

== Meaning ==

The term ecosystem health has been employed to embrace some suite of environmental goals deemed desirable.&lt;ref&gt;Slocombe, D. Scott (1998). "Defining Goals and Criteria for Ecosystem-Based Management." ''Environmental Management'' 22:483–493&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Grumbine's highly cited paper&lt;ref name=grumbine1994&gt;Grumbine, R. Edward (1994). "What is ecosystem management?" ''Conservation Biology'' 8:27-38&lt;/ref&gt; "What is ecosystem management?" surveyed ecosystem management and ecosystem health literature and summarized frequently encountered goal statements:
* Conserving [[viable population]]s of [[native species]]
* Conserving [[ecosystem diversity]]
* Maintaining evolutionary and ecological processes
* Managing over long time frames to maintain evolutionary potential
* Accommodating human use and occupancy within these constraints

Grumbine describes each of these goals as a "value statement" and stresses the role of human [[values]] in setting ecosystem management goals.

It is the last goal mentioned in the survey, accommodating humans, that is most contentious. "We have observed that when groups of stakeholders work to define … visions, this leads to debate over whether to emphasize ecosystem health or human well-being … Whether the priority is ecosystems or people greatly influences stakeholders' assessment of desirable ecological and social states."&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, heather M. and Karen L. McLeod (2007). "Confronting the challenges of implementing marine ecosystem-based management." ''Frontiers of Ecology and the Environment'' 5:540-548.&lt;/ref&gt; and, for example, "For some, [[wolves]] are critical to ecosystem health and an essential part of nature, for others they are a symbol of government overreach threatening their livelihoods and cultural values."&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Andrew (2015). Which wolf, which trap? Socially constructing wolves and trapping in western Montana. ''Scholar Works'', University of Montana, Oral Presentations.&lt;/ref&gt;

Measuring ecosystem health requires extensive goal-driven environmental sampling. For example, a vision for ecosystem health of [[Lake Superior]] was developed by a public forum and a series of objectives were prepared for [[habitat protection|protection of habitat]] and maintenance of populations of some 70 indigenous fish species.&lt;ref name=horns2003&gt;Horns, W.H., et al. (2003). '' Fish-community objectives for Lake Superior. '' Great Lakes Fish. Commission Special Publication. 03-01. 78 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; A suite of 80 lake health indicators was developed for the Great Lakes Basin including monitoring native fish species, exotic species, water levels, phosphorus levels, toxic chemicals, [[phytoplankton]], [[zooplankton]], fish tissue contaminants, etc.&lt;ref name=Shear2003&gt;Shear, Harvey et al. (2003). "The development and implementation of indicators of ecosystem health in the Great Lakes Basin." ''Journal of Environmental Monitoring and Assessment'' 88:119–152&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have attempted broad definitions of ecosystem health, such as benchmarking as healthy the historical ecosystem state "prior to the onset of [[anthropocene|anthropogenic stress]]."&lt;ref name=rapport2011&gt;Rapport, David J. and • Luisa Maffi  (2011). "Eco-cultural health, global health, and sustainability." ''Ecological Research'' 26:1039-1049&lt;/ref&gt; A difficulty is that the historical composition of many human-altered ecosystems is unknown or unknowable. Also, [[fossil record|fossil]] and [[pollen]] records indicate that the species that occupy an ecosystem [[ecologic succession|reshuffle]] through time, so it is difficult to identify one snapshot in time as optimum or "healthy.".&lt;ref name=wicklum1995&gt;Wicklum, D. and Ronald W. Davies (1995). "Ecosystem health and integrity?" ''Canadian Journal of Botany'' 73:997-1000.&lt;/ref&gt;

A commonly cited broad definition states that a healthy ecosystem has three attributes:
# [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]],
# [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]], and
# "organization" (including [[biodiversity]]).&lt;ref name=rapport2011 /&gt;

While this captures significant ecosystem properties, a generalization is elusive as those properties do not necessarily co-vary in nature. For example, there is not necessarily a clear or consistent relationship between productivity and species richness.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Peter et al. (2011). "Productivity is a poor predictor of plant species richness." ''Science'' 333:1750-1752.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the relationship between  [[System resilience|resilience]] and diversity is complex, and [[ecosystem stability]] may depend upon one or a few species rather than overall diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, Anthony R. and Stephen R. Carpenter (2007). "Stability and Diversity of Ecosystems." ''Science'' 317:58-62.&lt;/ref&gt; And some undesirable ecosystems are highly productive.&lt;ref&gt;Asanova, Umut (2002). "Philosophy of ecological ethics education, considering the Issyk-Kul Lake reediation mechanisms." Jean Klerkx and Beishen Imanakanov (2002). Lake Issk-Kul: Its natural Environment Springer Science&lt;/ref&gt;

"Resilience is not desirable per se. There can be highly resilient states of ecosystems which are very undesirable from some human perspectives , such as algal-dominated [[coral reef]]s."&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt; Ecological [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]] is a "capacity" that varies depending upon which properties of the ecosystem are to be studied and depending upon what kinds of disturbances are considered and how they are to be quantified.  Approaches to assessing it "face high uncertainties and still require a considerable amount of empirical and theoretical research."&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt;

Other authors have sought a numerical index of ecosystem health that would permit quantitative comparisons among ecosystems and within ecosystems over time.  One such system employs ratings of the three properties mentioned above: Health = system vigor x system organization x [[system resilience]].&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R. 1992. "Toward an operational definition of ecosystem health." Pp 239-256 in Costanza, R., B. Norton, and B. Haskell. ''Ecosystem health. New Goals for Environmental Management. '' Washington DC: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecologist Glenn Suter argues that such indices employ "nonsense units," the indices have "no meaning; they cannot be predicted, so they are not applicable to most regulatory problems; they have no diagnostic power; effects of one component are eclipsed by responses of other components, and the reason for a high or low index value is unknown."&lt;ref name=suter1993&gt;Suter, Glenn W. (1993). "A critique of ecosystem health concepts and indexes." ''Environmental toxicology and chemistry'' 12:1533-1539.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health indicators ==

Health [[Performance metric|metrics]] are determined by stakeholder goals, which drive ecosystem definition. An ecosystem is an abstraction.&lt;ref&gt;Jax, Kurt (2007). "Can we define ecosystems? On the confusion between definition and description of ecological concepts." ''Acta Biotheor'' 55:341–355&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Oneill2001&gt;O'Neill, Robert V. (2001). "Is it time to bury the ecosystem concept? (with full military honors, of course!)" ''Ecology'' 82:3275–3284&lt;/ref&gt;  "Ecosystems cannot be identified or found in nature. Instead, they must be delimited by an observer. This can be done in many different ways for the same chunk of nature, depending on the specific perspectives of interest."&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt;

Ecosystem definition determines the acceptable range of variability (reference conditions) and determines measurement variables. The latter are used as indicators of ecosystem structure and function, and can be used as indicators of "health".

An [[Environmental indicator|indicator]] is a variable, such as a chemical or biological property, that when measured, is used to infer trends in another (unmeasured) environmental variable or cluster of unmeasured variables (the indicandum). For example, rising [[mortality rate]] of canaries in a coal mine is an indicator of rising [[carbon monoxide]] levels. Rising [[chlorophyll-a]] levels in a lake may signal [[eutrophication]].&lt;ref&gt;Wright, David A. and Pamela Welbourne (2002) ''Environmental Toxicology''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecosystem assessments employ two kinds of indicators, descriptive indicators and normative indicators. "Indicators can be used descriptively for a scientific purpose or normatively for a political purpose."&lt;ref name=heink2010&gt;Heink, Ulrich and Ingo Kowarik (2010) "What are indicators? On the definition of indicators in ecology and environmental planning." ''Ecological Indicators'' 10:584–593&lt;/ref&gt;

Used descriptively, high chlorophyll-a is an indicator of eutrophication, but it may also be used as an ecosystem health indicator. When used as a normative (health) indicator, it indicates a rank on a health scale, a rank that can vary widely depending on societal preferences as to what is desirable. A high chlorophyll-a level in a natural [[ecological succession|successional]] [[wetland]] might be viewed as healthy whereas a human-impacted wetland with the ''same'' indicator value may be judged unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza,  Robert, and Michael Mageau (1999). "What is a healthy ecosystem?" ''Aquatic Ecology'' 33: 105–115&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimation of ecosystem health has been criticized for intermingling the two types of environmental indicators.&lt;ref name=heink2010 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carolan, Michael (2006). "The values and vulnerabilities of metaphors within the environmental sciences." ''Society and Natural Resources'' 19:921–930&lt;/ref&gt; A health indicator is a normative indicator, and if conflated with descriptive indicators "implies that normative values can be measured objectively, which is certainly not true. Thus, implicit values are insinuated to the reader, a situation which has to be avoided."&lt;ref name=heink2010 /&gt;

It can be argued that the very act of selecting indicators of any kind is [[bias]]ed by the observer's perspective&lt;ref&gt;Jax, Kurt (2005). "Function and 'functioning' in ecology: what does it mean?" ''Oikos'' 111:3&lt;/ref&gt; but separation of goals from descriptions has been advocated as a step toward transparency:  "A separation of descriptive and normative indicators is essential from the perspective of the philosophy of science … Goals and values cannot be deduced directly from descriptions … a fact that is emphasized repeatedly in the literature of environmental ethics … Hence, we advise always specifying the definition of indicators and propose clearly distinguishing ecological indicators in science from policy indicators used for decision-making processes."&lt;ref name=heink2010 /&gt;

And integration of multiple, possibly conflicting, normative indicators into a single measure of "ecosystem health" is problematic. Using 56 indicators, "determining environmental status and assessing [[marine ecosystem]]s health in an integrative way is still one of the grand challenges in marine ecosystems ecology, research and management"&lt;ref&gt;Borja A, et al. (2014). "Tales from a thousand and one ways to integrate marine ecosystem components when assessing the environmental status." ''Frontiers in Marine Science''. 1:72&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue with indicators is validity. Good indicators must have an independently validated high [[Predictive value of tests|predictive value]], that is high [[sensitivity (control systems)|sensitivity]] (high probability of indicating a significant change in the indicandum) and high [[specificity (statistics)|specificity]] (low probability of wrongly indicating a change). The reliability of various health metrics has been questioned&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Guy, et al. (2012). Continental-wide effects of nutrient pollution on stream ecosystem functioning. ''Science'', 336:1448-1440.&lt;/ref&gt; and "what combination of measurements should be used to evaluate ecosystems is a matter of current scientific debate."&lt;ref name=palmer2012&gt;Palmer, Margaret A. and Catherine M. Febria (2012). "The heartbeat of ecosystems." ''Science'' 336:1393-1394.&lt;/ref&gt; Most attempts to identify ecological indicators have been [[correlation|correlative]] rather than derived from prospective testing of their predictive value&lt;ref&gt;Barton, Philip S. et al. (2015). "Learning from clinical medicine to improve the use of surrogates in ecology." ''Oikos'' 124:391-398.&lt;/ref&gt; and the selection process for many indicators has been based upon weak evidence or has been lacking in evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed A.H. et al. (2016). "How do ecologists select and use indicator species to monitor ecological change? Insights from 14 years of publication in ''Ecological Indicators''." ''Ecological Indicator''s 60:223-230.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases no reliable indicators are known: "We found no examples of [[invertebrates]] successfully used in [forest] monitoring programs. Their richness and abundance ensure that they play significant roles in ecosystem function but thwart focus on a few key species." And, "Reviews of species-based monitoring approaches reveal that no single species, nor even a group of species, accurately reflects entire communities. Understanding the response of a single species may not provide reliable predictions about a group of species even when the group is {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} a few very similar species."&lt;ref&gt;Kremsater, Laurie L. and Fred L. Bunnell (2009). "Sustaining forest-dwelling species." Pages 173-218 in Bunnell, Fred L. and Glen B. Dunsworth (2009). ''Forestry and Biodiversity''. Learning how to Sustain Biodiversity in Managed Forests. UBC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to human health: the health paradox ==

A trade-off between human health and the "health" of nature has been termed the "health paradox"&lt;ref&gt;C. Max Finlayson and Pierre Horwitz (2015). "Wetlands as settings for human health – the benefits and the paradox."  Pages 1-13 in Finlayson, C.M. et al. 2015. ''Wetlands and Human Health''. Springer&lt;/ref&gt; and it illuminates how human values drive perceptions of ecosystem health.

Human health has benefited by sacrificing the "health" of wild ecosystems, such as dismantling and [[dam]]ming of wild valleys, destruction of [[mosquito]]-bearing [[wetlands]], diversion of water for [[irrigation]], conversion of wilderness to [[farmland]], [[timber]] removal, and [[Local extinction|extirpation]] of [[tiger]]s, whales, ferrets, and [[wolves]].

There has been an acrimonious schism among [[conservation movement|conservationists]] and resource managers&lt;ref&gt;Tallis, Heather and  &amp; Jane Lubchenco  (2014) "Working together: A call for inclusive conservation." ''Nature'' 515, 27–28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tudela, Sergi and Katherine Short (2005). "Paradigm shifts, gaps, inertia, and political agendas in ecosystem-based fisheries management." ''Marine Ecology Progress Series'' 300:282-286.&lt;/ref&gt; over the question of whether to "ratchet back human domination of the biosphere" or whether to embrace it.&lt;ref&gt;Noss, Redd et al. (2013). "Humanity's domination of nature is part of the problem: a response to Kareiva and Marvier." ''BioScience'' 63:241-242&lt;/ref&gt; These two perspectives have been characterized as utilitarian vs protectionist.&lt;ref&gt;Nijhius, Michelle (2014). "Bridging the conservation divide."  New Yorker, December 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[utilitarian]] view treats [[human health]] and [[well-being]] as criteria of ecosystem health.&lt;ref&gt;Su, Meirong et al. (2010)."Urban ecosystem health assessment: A review." ''Science of the Total Environment'' 408:2425–2434&lt;/ref&gt; For example, destruction of wetlands to control malaria mosquitoes "resulted in an improvement in ecosystem health."&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, David J. (1998). "Some distinctions worth making." ''Ecosystem Health'' 4:193-194.&lt;/ref&gt;
The protectionist view treats humans as an invasive species: "If there was ever a species that qualified as an invasive pest, it is ''Homo sapiens'',"&lt;ref name=Oneill2001 /&gt;

Proponents of the utilitarian view argue that "healthy ecosystems are characterized by their capability to sustain healthy human populations,"&lt;ref name=rapport1998 /&gt; and "healthy ecosystems must be economically viable," as it is "unhealthy" ecosystems that are likely to result in increases in [[contamination]], [[infectious disease]]s, fires, floods, [[crop failure]]s and fishery collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, David (1998). "Dimensions of ecosystem health." Pages 34-40 in Rapport, D.J. (ed.) (1998). ''Ecosystem Health''. Blackwell Scientific.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Protectionist]]s argue that privileging of human health is a [[conflict of interest]] as humans have [[ecosystem destruction|demolished]] massive numbers of ecosystems to maintain their welfare, also disease and [[parasitism]] are historically normal in pre-industrial nature.&lt;ref name=wilkins1999&gt;Wilkins, D.A. (1999). "Assessing ecosystem health."  ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution'' 14:70&lt;/ref&gt; Diseases and parasites promote ecosystem functioning, driving biodiversity and productivity,&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Peter J., Andrew P. Dobson and Kevin D. Lafferty (2006). "Is a healthy ecosystem one that is rich in parasites?" ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution'' 21:381-385.&lt;/ref&gt; and parasites may constitute a significant fraction of ecosystem biomass.&lt;ref&gt;Kuris, Armand M. et al. (2008). "Ecosystem energetic implications of parasite and free-living biomass in three estuaries." ''Nature'' 454:515-518.&lt;/ref&gt;

The very choice of the word "health" applied to ecology has been questioned as lacking in neutrality in a BioScience article on responsible use of scientific language: "Some conservationists fear that these terms could endorse human domination of the planet … and could exacerbate the shifting cognitive baseline whereby humans tend to become accustomed to new and often degraded ecosystems and thus forget the nature of the past."&lt;ref&gt;Kueffer, Christoph and Brendon M. H. Larson (2014). "Responsible Use of Language in Scientific Writing and Science Communication." ''BioScience'' 64(8): 719–724.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of the concept and proposed alternatives ==

Criticism of ecosystem health largely targets the failure of proponents to explicitly distinguish the normative dimension from the descriptive dimension, and has included the following:
* Ecosystem health is in the eye of the beholder. It is an economic, political or ethical judgement rather than a scientific measure of environmental quality. Health ratings are shaped by the goals and preferences of environmental stakeholders.&lt;ref name=lancaster2000&gt;Lancaster, Jill (2000). "The Ridiculous Notion of Assessing Ecological Health and Identifying the Useful Concepts Underneath."''Human and Ecological Risk Assessment'' 6: 213-222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carolan, Michael S. (2006). "Science, Expertise, and the Democratization of the Decision-Making Process." ''Society and Natural Resources'' 19:661–668&lt;/ref&gt; "At the core of debates over the utility of ecosystem health is a struggle over which societal preferences will take precedence."&lt;ref name=lackey2003&gt;Lackey, Robert T. (2003). "Appropriate use of ecosystem health and normative science in ecological policy" Pages. 175-186 in: Rapport, David J. et al. (2003)  ''Managing for Healthy Ecosystems ''  Boca Raton, Florida: Lewis Publishers, , 1510 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Health is a metaphor, not a property of an ecosystem. Health is an abstraction. It implies "good", an optimum condition, but in nature ecosystems are ever-changing transitory assemblages with no identifiable optimum.&lt;ref name=wicklum1995 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calow, P. (1992)." Can ecosystems be healthy? Critical consideration of concepts." ''Journal of Aquatic Ecosystem Health'' 1:1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use of human health and well-being as a criterion of ecosystem health introduces an arrogance and a conflict of interest into environmental assessment, as human population growth has caused much [[environmental damage]].&lt;ref name=wilkins1999 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Thomas R. Jr. (1995). "Ecosystem management and the arrogance of humanism." ''Conservation Biology'' 9:255-262&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ecosystem health masquerades as an operational goal because environmental managers "may be reluctant to define their goals clearly."&lt;ref name=lackey2001 /&gt;
* It is a vague concept.&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duarte, Carlos M. et al. (2015). "Paradigms in the recovery of estuarine and coastal ecosystems." ''Estuaries and Coasts'' 38:1202-1212&lt;/ref&gt; "Currently there are many, often contradictory, definitions of ecosystem health,"&lt;ref name=lackey2001&gt;Lackey, Robert T. (2001). "Values, Policy, and Ecosystem Health." ''BioScience'' 51(6):437-443&lt;/ref&gt; that "are open to so much abuse and misuse that they represent a threat to the environment."&lt;ref name=lancaster2000 /&gt;
* "There are in general no clear definitions of what proponents of the concept mean by 'ecosystem'."&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt;
* The public can be deceived by the term ecosystem health which may camouflage the ramifications of a policy goal and be employed to pejoratively rank policy choices.&lt;ref name=lackey2001 /&gt; "The most pervasive misuse of ecosystem health and similar normative notions is insertion of personal values under the guise of 'scientific' impartiality."&lt;ref name=lackey2003 /&gt;

Alternatives have been proposed for the term ecosystem health, including more neutral language such as ecosystem status,&lt;ref&gt;Link, Jason S. (2002) "What Does Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management Mean?" ''Fisheries'' 27:18-21&lt;/ref&gt; ecosystem prognosis, and ecosystem sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Schrecker, Ted (1995) Synthesis of Discussion.pp 118-125 in  Hodge, Tony et al. ''Pathways to Sustainability: Assessing Our Progress''. Ottawa: National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy.&lt;/ref&gt; Another alternative to the use of a health metaphor is  to "express exactly and clearly the public policy and the management objective", to employ habitat descriptors and real properties of ecosystems.&lt;ref name=suter1993 /&gt;&lt;ref name=lancaster2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=lackey2001 /&gt; An example of a policy statement is "The maintenance of viable natural populations of wildlife and ecological functions always takes precedence over any human use of wildlife."&lt;ref&gt;Anon (1995). ''Wildlife policy for Prince Edward Island. Government of Prince Edward Island'', 18 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a goal is "Maintain viable populations of all native species in situ."&lt;ref name=grumbine1994 /&gt; An example of a management objective is "Maintain self-sustaining populations of lake whitefish within the range of abundance observed during 1990-99."&lt;ref name=horns2003 /&gt;

Kurt Jax&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt; presented an ecosystem assessment format that avoids imposing a preconceived notion of normality, that avoids the muddling of normative and descriptive, and that gives serious attention to ecosystem definition. (1) Societal purposes for the ecosystem are negotiated by stakeholders, (2) a functioning ecosystem is defined with emphasis on phenomena relevant to stakeholder goals, (3) benchmark reference conditions and permissible variation of the system are established, (4) measurement variables are chosen for use as indicators, and (5) the time scale and spatial scale of assessment are decided.

== Related terms ==

[[Ecological health]] has been used as a medical term in reference to human allergy and multiple chemical sensitivity&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, Gail (2001). ''Living with multiple chemical sensitivity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9205">[[File:Romuvan ritual fire.png|thumb|An ''aukuras'', a type of fire altar found in [[Romuva (religion)|Romuva]], a modern Pagan faith characterised as a "nature religion".]]

A '''nature religion''' is a religious movement that believes [[nature]] and the [[Natural environment|natural world]] is an embodiment of divinity, sacredness or spiritual power.&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 11"/&gt; Nature religions include [[indigenous religion]]s [[Nature worship|practiced]] in various parts of the world by cultures who consider the environment to be imbued with spirits and other sacred entities. It also includes [[modern Paganism|contemporary Pagan]] faiths which are primarily concentrated in Europe and North America.

The term "nature religion" was first coined by the American [[religious studies]] scholar [[Catherine Albanese]], who used it in her work ''Nature Religion in America: From the Algonkian Indians to the New Age'' (1991) and later went on to use it in other studies. Following on from Albanese's development of the term it has since been used by other academics working in the discipline.

==Definition==
Catherine Albanese described nature religion as "a symbolic center and the cluster of beliefs, behaviours, and values that encircles it", deeming it to be useful for shining a light on aspects of history that are rarely viewed as religious.{{sfn|Albanese|1991|pp=7&amp;ndash;8}}
In a paper of his on the subject, the Canadian religious studies scholar Peter Beyer described "nature religion" as a "useful analytical abstraction" to refer to "any religious belief or practice in which devotees consider nature to be the embodiment of divinity, sacredness, transcendence, spiritual power, or whatever cognate term one wishes to use".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 11"&gt;[[#Bey98|Beyer 1998]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to note that in this way nature religion was not an "identifiable religious tradition" such as [[Buddhism]] or [[Christianity]] are, but that it instead covers "a range of religious and quasi-religious movements, groups and social networks whose participants may or may not identify with one of the many constructed religions of global society which referred to many other nature religion."&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 16"&gt;[[#Bey98|Beyer 1998]]. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amatciems July 2015.jpg|thumb|left|Amatciems, a settlement of [[Ringing Cedars' Anastasians]] in [[Drabeši Parish]], [[Latvia]]. Anastasianism is a Russian-originated modern Pagan movement that sacralises environmental and human nativity (''[[Rod (Slavic religion)|Rod]]''), and is therefore regarded as a "nature religion".]]

===Common characteristics===
Peter Beyer noted the existence of a series of common characteristics which he believed were shared by different nature religions. He remarked that although "one must be careful not to overgeneralise", he suspected that there were a series of features which "occur sufficiently often" in those nature religions known to recorded scholarship to constitute a pattern.&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt;

The first of these common characteristics was nature religion's "comparative resistance to institutionalisation and legitimisation in terms of identifiable socio-religious authorities and organisations", meaning that nature religionists rarely formed their religious beliefs into large, visible socio-political structures such as churches. Furthermore, Beyer noted, nature religionists often held a "concomitant distrust of and even eschewing of politically orientated power".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt; Instead of this, he felt that among nature religious communities, there was "a valuing of community as non-hierarchical" and a "conditional optimism with regard to human capacity and the future."&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt;

In the sphere of the environment, Beyer noted that nature religionists held to a "holistic conception of reality" and "a valorisation of physical place as vital aspects of their spiritualities".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt; Similarly, Beyer noted the [[individualism]] which was favoured by nature religionists. He remarked that those adhering to such beliefs typically had respect for "charismatic and hence purely individual authority" and place a "strong emphasis on individual paths" which led them to believe in "the equal value of individuals and groups". Along similar lines, he also commented on the "strong experiential basis" to nature religionist beliefs "where personal experience is a final arbiter of truth or validity".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt;

==Use within academia==
In April 1996, the [[University of Lancaster]] in North West England held a conference on contemporary Paganism entitled "Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samuel|first=Geoffrey|date=1996-10-01|title=Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s. Conference at the Lake District Campus of Lancaster University, 9th to 13th April 1996|journal=Religion|volume=26|issue=4|pages=373–376|doi=10.1006/reli.1996.0031|issn=0048-721X}}&lt;/ref&gt;", and ultimately led to the publication of an academic anthology of the same name two years later.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pea98|Pearson, Roberts and Samuel 1998]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 8"&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This book, ''Nature Religion Today: Paganism in the Modern World'', was edited by members of the University's Department of Religious Studies, a postgraduate named Joanne Pearson and two professors, Richard H. Roberts and Geoffrey Samuel.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pea98|Pearson, Roberts and Samuel 1998]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In his study of [[Wicca]], the [[Pagan studies]] scholar Ethan Doyle White expressed the view that the category of "nature religion" was problematic from a "historical perspective" because it solely emphasises the "commonalities of belief and attitude to the natural world" that are found between different religions and in doing so divorces these different belief systems from their distinctive socio-cultural and historical backgrounds.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=8}}

[[File:NRCSIA00041 - Iowa (2285)(NRCS Photo Gallery).jpg|thumb|Multiple rows of trees and shrubs, as well as a native grass strip, combine in a [[riparian buffer]] to protect Bear Creek in Story County, Iowa, [[United States]].]]

'''Nature-based solutions''' ('''NBS''') refers to the [[sustainable management]] and use of nature for tackling socio-environmental challenges. The challenges include issues such as [[climate change]], [[water security]], [[water pollution]], [[food security]], [[human health]], and [[disaster]] [[risk]] management.

A definition by the [[European Union]] states that these solutions are "inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simultaneously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build [[Resilience (engineering and construction)|resilience]]. The [http://www.naturebasedsolutionsinitiative.org/about/ Nature-based Solutions Initiative] meanwhile defines them as "actions that work with and enhance nature so as to help people adapt to change and disasters". Such solutions bring more, and more diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient and systemic interventions".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.think-nature.eu/|title=thinknature|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With NBS, healthy, resilient and diverse [[ecosystems]] (whether natural, managed or newly created) can provide solutions for the benefit of societies and overall [[biodiversity]].

For instance, the restoration or protection of [[mangroves]] along coastlines utilizes a nature-based solution to accomplish several things. Mangroves moderate the impact of waves and wind on coastal settlements or cities and sequester CO&lt;sub&gt;2.&lt;/sub&gt; . They also provide safe nurseries for marine life that can be the basis for sustaining populations of fish that local populations may depend on. Additionally, the mangrove forests can help control coastal erosion resulting from sea level rise. Similarly, in cities [[green roofs]] or walls are nature-based solutions that can be used to moderate the impact of high temperatures, capture storm water, abate [[pollution]], and act as carbon sinks, while enhancing [[biodiversity]].

Conservation approaches and environment management initiatives have been carried out for decades. What is new is that the benefits of such nature-based solutions to human well-being have been articulated well more recently. Even if the term itself is still being framed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-01-12|title=‘Nature-based solutions’ is the latest green jargon that means more than you might think|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/541133b|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=541|issue=7636|pages=133–134|doi=10.1038/541133b|bibcode=2017Natur.541R.133.}}&lt;/ref&gt; examples of nature-based solutions can be found all over the world, and imitated. Nature-based solutions are on their way to being mainstreamed in national and international policies and programmes (e.g. climate change policy, law, infrastructure investment and financing mechanisms).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} For example, the theme for [[World Water Day]] 2018 was "Nature for water" and by [[UN-Water]]'s accompanying [[UN World Water Development Report]] had the title "Nature-based Solutions for Water".&lt;ref&gt;UN-Water (2018) [http://www.unwater.org/publications/world-water-development-report-2018/ World Water Development Report 2018: Nature-based Solutions for Water], Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

Societies increasingly face challenges such as [[climate change]], [[urbanization]], jeopardized [[food security]] and [[water resource]] provision, and [[disaster]] [[risk]]. One approach to answer these challenges is to singularly rely on technological strategies. An alternative approach is to manage the [[Socio-ecological system|(socio-)ecological systems]] in a comprehensive way in order to sustain and potentially increase the delivery of ecosystem services to humans. In this context, nature-based solutions (NBS) have recently been put forward by practitioners and quickly thereafter by [[policymakers]]. These solutions stress the sustainable use of nature in solving coupled environmental-social-economic challenges.

While [[ecosystem services]] are often valued in terms of immediate benefits to human well-being and economy, NBS focus on the benefits to people and the environment itself, to allow for sustainable solutions that are able to respond to environmental change and [[hazard]]s in the long-term. NBS go beyond the traditional biodiversity conservation and management principles by "re-focusing" the debate on humans and specifically integrating societal factors such as human well-being and [[poverty reduction]], [[Socioeconomic development|socio-economic development]], and [[governance]] principles.

With respect to water issues, NBS can achieve the following, according to the [[World Water Development Report]] 2018 by [[UN-Water]]:&lt;ref&gt;UN-Water (2018) [http://www.unwater.org/publications/world-water-development-report-2018/ World Water Development Report 2018], Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Use natural processes to enhance water availability (e.g., [[soil]] moisture retention, [[groundwater recharge]]),  
* Improve [[water quality]] (e.g., [[Wetland|natural wetlands]] and [[constructed wetlands]] to treat [[wastewater]], [[riparian buffer]] strips), and  
* Reduce risks associated with water‐related disasters and climate change (e.g., [[floodplain restoration]], [[green roofs]]).

=== Related concepts ===
In 2015, the European network [http://www.biodiversa.org BiodivERsA] highlighted how NBS relate to concepts like ecosystem approaches and ecological engineering.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/oekom/gaia/2015/00000024/00000004/art00010;jsessionid=30kr3rgvgkcxb.x-ic-live-01|title=Nature-based Solutions: New Influence for Environmental Management and Research in Europe|last=Eggermont|first=Hilde|last2=Balian|first2=Estelle|date=2015|website=www.ingentaconnect.com|language=en|doi=10.14512/gaia.24.4.9|access-date=2019-02-11|last3=Azevedo|first3=José Manuel N.|last4=Beumer|first4=Victor|last5=Brodin|first5=Tomas|last6=Claudet|first6=Joachim|last7=Fady|first7=Bruno|last8=Grube|first8=Martin|last9=Keune|first9=Hans}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBS are strongly connected to ideas such as natural systems [[agriculture]],&lt;ref name="Jackson1"&gt;Jackson, D.L. 2002.

Meeting the relational challenge of ecological engineering within ecological sciences. Ecological Engineering 45: 13–23.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, ecosystem-based approaches are increasingly promoted for climate change adaptation and [[Climate change mitigation|mitigation]] by organisations like [[United Nations Environment Programme]] and [[non-governmental organisations]] such as [[The Nature Conservancy]]. These organisations refer to "policies and measures that take into account the role of ecosystem services in reducing the vulnerability of society to climate change, in a multi-sectoral and multi-scale approach".&lt;ref name="Cowan3" /&gt;

Likewise, natural infrastructure is defined as a "strategically planned and managed network of natural lands, such as forests and wetlands, working landscapes, and other open spaces that conserves or enhances ecosystem values and functions and provides associated benefits to human populations";&lt;ref name="Smith5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ozment6" /&gt; and [[green infrastructure]] refers to an "interconnected network of green spaces that conserves natural systems and provides assorted benefits to human populations".&lt;ref name="Benedict7" /&gt;

Similarly, the concept of [[ecological engineering]] generally refers to "protecting, restoring (i.e. ecosystem restoration) or modifying ecological systems to increase the quantity, quality and sustainability of particular services they provide, or to build new ecological systems that provide services that would otherwise be provided through more conventional engineering, based on non-renewable resources".&lt;ref name="Borsje8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barot9" /&gt;

=== Definitions ===
The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) defines NBS as actions to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems, that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits,&lt;ref name="Cohen-Shacham10"&gt;Cohen-Shacham, E., G.

&lt;/ref&gt; However, different stakeholders view NBS from other perspectives.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For instance, [[IUCN]]&lt;ref name="IUCN16"&gt;IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature). 2016. Resolution 077 World Conservation Congress 2016, Hawai’i (https://portals.iucn.org/congress/motion/077)&lt;/ref&gt; defines NBS as "actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems, which address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits". This framing puts the need for well-managed and restored ecosystems at the heart of NBS, with the overarching goal of "Supporting the achievement of society's development goals and safeguard human well-being in ways that reflect cultural and societal values and enhance the resilience of ecosystems, their capacity for renewal and the provision of services".

In the context of the ongoing political debate on jobs and growth (main drivers of the current EU policy agenda), the European Commission underlines that NBS can transform environmental and societal challenges into innovation opportunities, by turning [[natural capital]] into a source for green growth and sustainable development.&lt;ref name="European Commission 2015" /&gt; In their view, NBS to societal challenges are "solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simultaneously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient and systemic interventions.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"&gt;European Commission. 2016. Horizon2020 Work Programme 2016–2017 – 12. Climate action, environment, resource efficiency &amp; raw materials, 99 pp. (http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2016_2017/main/h2020-wp1617-climate_en.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;"

This framing is somewhat broader, and puts economy and social assets at the heart of NBS as importantly as sustaining environmental conditions. It shares similarities with the definition proposed by Maes and Jacobs (2015)&lt;ref&gt;Maes, J., S. Jacobs. 2015. Conservation Letters {{doi|10.1111/conl.12216}}&lt;/ref&gt; defining NBS as "any transition to a use of ES with decreased input of non-renewable natural capital and increased investment in renewable natural processes". In their view, development and evaluation of NBS spans three basic requirements: (1) decrease of fossil fuel input per produced unit; (2) lowering of systemic trade-offs and increasing synergies between ES; and (3) increasing labor input and jobs. Here, nature is seen as a tool to inspire more systemic solutions to societal problems.

Whatever definition used, promoting sustainability and the increased role of natural, self-sustained processes relying on [[biodiversity]], are inherent to NBS. They constitute actions easily seen as positive for a wide range of stakeholders, as they bring about benefits at environmental, economic and social levels. As a consequence, the concept of NBS is gaining acceptance outside the conservation community (e.g. urban planning) and is now on its way to be mainstreamed into policies and programmes (climate change policy, law, infrastructure investment and financing mechanisms).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

== Types ==

[[File:Fig 2 NbS.jpg|thumb|upright=1.46|Schematic presentation of the NBS typology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;]]

In 2014-2015, the European network BiodivERsA mobilized a range of scientists, research donors and stakeholders and proposed a typology characterizing NBS along two gradients.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 1. "how much engineering of biodiversity and ecosystems is involved in NBS", and 2. "how many ecosystem services and stakeholder groups are targeted by a given NBS". The typology highlights that NBS can involve very different actions on ecosystems (from protection to management and even creation of new ecosystems) and is based on the assumption that the higher the number of services and stakeholder groups targeted, the lower the capacity to maximize the delivery of each service and simultaneously fulfil the specific needs of all stakeholder groups. As such, three types of NBS are distinguished (Figure 2):

=== Type 1 – Minimal intervention in ecosystems ===
Type 1 NBS consists of no or minimal intervention in ecosystems, with the objectives of maintaining or improving the delivery of a range of ES both inside and outside of these conserved ecosystems. Examples include the protection of mangroves in coastal areas to limit risks associated to extreme weather conditions and provide benefits and opportunities to local populations; and the establishment of marine protected areas to conserve biodiversity within these areas while exporting biomass into fishing grounds. This type of NBS is connected to, for example, the concept of [[Man and the Biosphere Programme|biosphere reserves]] which incorporates core protected areas for nature conservation and buffer zones and transition areas where people live and work in a sustainable way.

=== Type 2 – Some interventions in ecosystems and landscapes ===
Type 2 NBS corresponds to management approaches that develop sustainable and multifunctional ecosystems and landscapes (extensively or intensively managed). These types improve the delivery of selected ES compared to what would be obtained with a more conventional intervention. Examples include innovative planning of agricultural landscapes to increase their multi-functionality; and approaches for enhancing tree species and genetic diversity to increase forest resilience to extreme events. This type of NBS is strongly connected to concepts like natural systems agriculture,&lt;ref name="Jackson1" /&gt; agro-ecology,&lt;ref&gt;Alteri, M.A. 1989. Agroecology – a new research and development paradigm for world agriculture. Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment 27: 37–36.&lt;/ref&gt; and evolutionary-orientated forestry.&lt;ref&gt;Lefèvre F. et al. 2014. Considering evolutionary processes in adaptive forestry. Annals of Forest Science 71: 723 – 739.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Type 3 – Managing ecosystems in extensive ways ===
Type 3 NBS consists of managing ecosystems in very extensive ways or even creating new ecosystems (e.g., artificial ecosystems with new assemblages of organisms for green roofs and walls to mitigate city warming and clean polluted air). Type 3 is linked to concepts like green and blue infrastructures and objectives like restoration of heavily degraded or polluted areas and greening cities.

Type 1 and 2 would typically fall within the IUCN NBS framework, whereas Type 2 and moreover Type 3 are often exemplified by EC for turning natural capital into a source for green growth and sustainable development.

=== Hybrid solutions ===
Hybrid solutions exist along this gradient both in space and time. For instance, at landscape scale, mixing protected and managed areas could be needed to fulfil multi-functionality and sustainability goals. Similarly, a [[constructed wetland]] can be developed as a type 3 but, when well established, may subsequently be preserved and surveyed as a type 1.

== Examples ==

Demonstrating the benefits of nature and healthy ecosystems and showcasing the return on investment they can offer is necessary in order to increase awareness, but also to provide support and guidance on how to implement NBS. A large number of initiatives around the world already highlight the effectiveness of NBS approaches to address a wide range of societal challenges.

==== East Kolkata wetlands ====
In 2018, [[The Hindu]] reported that the [[East Kolkata wetlands]], the world's largest organic sewage treatment facility had been used to clean the sewage of Kolkata in an organic manner by using algae for several decades. In use since the 1930s, the natural system was discovered by Dhrubajyoti Ghosh, an ecologist and a municipal engineer in the 1970s while working in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestatesman.com/opinion/wetlands-will-weep-today-1502586927.html|title=The wetlands will weep today|last1=Ghatak|first1=Aditi Roy|date=17 February 2018|accessdate=8 March 2018|publisher=The Statesman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghosh worked for decades to protect the wetlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhrubajyoti.net/publ/Dr.%20Ghosh_changemaker.pdf|title=The Calcutta Wetlands: turning bad water into good|last1=Ghosh|first1=Dhrubajyoti|website=www.dhrubajyoti.net|publisher=Changemakers (issue October 2008)|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been a practice in [[Kolkata]], one of the five largest cities in [[India]], for the municipal authorities to pump sewage into shallow ponds (''bheris'').&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://dhrubajyoti.net/Final%20Ecosystem%20Book.pdf|title=Ecosystem management – towards merging theory and practice|last1=Ghosh|first1=Dhrubajyoti|date=2 October 2014|publisher=Nimby books|isbn=9788190657044|location=New delhi|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the heat of the tropical sun, algae proliferated in them, converting the sewage into clean water, which in turn was used by villagers to grow paddy and vegetables. This system has been in use in the region since the 1930s and treats 750 million litres of [[wastewater]] per day, giving livelihood to 100,000 people in the vicinity.&lt;ref name="kol"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aseem|first1=Shrivastava|title=The ecologically subsidised city: on Kolkata's wetland communities|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-ecologically-subsidised-city/article22970933.ece|accessdate=8 March 2018|publisher=The Hindu|date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For his work, Ghosh was included in the UN Global 500 Roll of Honour in 1990 and received the [[Luc Hoffmann]] award in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.global500.org/index.php/year/1990?start=100|title=Global 500 environmental forum|website=www.global500.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical implementation ==
{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2018}}
There is currently no accepted basis on which a government agency, municipality or private company can systematically assess the efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of a particular nature-based solution. However, a series of principles are proposed to guide effective and appropriate implementation, and thus to upscale NBS in practice. For example, NBS embrace and are not meant to replace nature conservation norms. Also, NBS are determined by site-specific natural and cultural contexts that include traditional, local and scientific knowledge. NBS are an integral part of the overall design of policies, and measure or actions, to address a specific challenges. Finally, NBS can be implemented alone or in an integrated manner with other solutions to societal challenges (e.g. technological and engineering solutions) and they are applied at the landscape scale.

Implementing NBS requires political, economic, and scientific challenges to be tackled. First and foremost, private sector investment is needed, not to replace but to supplement traditional sources of capital such as public funding or [[philanthropy]]. The challenge is therefore to provide a robust evidence base for the contribution of nature to economic growth and jobs, and to demonstrate the economic viability of these solutions – compared to technological ones – on a timescale compatible with that of global change. Furthermore, it requires measures like adaptation of economic subsidy schemes, and the creation of opportunities for [[conservation finance]], to name a few. Indeed, such measures will be needed to scale up NBS interventions, and strengthen their impact in mitigating the world's most pressing challenges.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

=== Projects supported by the European Union ===
Since 2016, the EU is supporting a multi-stakeholder dialogue platform (called ThinkNature) to promote the co-design, testing and deployment of improved and innovative NBS in an integrated way.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Creation of such science-policy-business-society interfaces could promote the market uptake of NBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nikolaidis|first=Nikolaos P.|last2=Kolokotsa|first2=Dionyssia|last3=Banwart|first3=Steven A.|date=2017-03-16|title=Nature-based solutions: business|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7645/full/543315d.html?foxtrotcallback=true|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=543|issue=7645|pages=315–315|doi=10.1038/543315d|issn=0028-0836|bibcode=2017Natur.543..315N}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is part of the EU’s Horizon 2020 – Research and Innovation programme, and will last for 3 years. There are a total of 17 international partners involved, including the Technical University of Crete (Project Leader), the University of Helsinki and BiodivERsA.

In 2017, as part of the Presidency of the [[Estonia|Estonian Republic]] of the [[Council of the European Union]], a conference called “Nature-based Solutions: From Innovation to Common-use” was organized by the Ministry of the Environment of Estonia and the University of Tallinn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nbs2017.eu/|title=Nature-Based Solutions, Tallinn, 24–26 October 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conference aimed to strengthen synergies among various recent initiatives and programs related to NBS launched by the European Commission and by the EU Member States, focusing on policy and governance of NBS, and on research and innovation.

=== Nature-based Solutions in the Paris Agreement ===
In recognition of the importance of natural ecosystems for mitigation and adaptation, the [http://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/convention/application/pdf/english_paris_agreement.pdf Paris Agreement] calls on all Parties to acknowledge “the importance of the conservation and enhancement, as appropriate, of sinks and reservoirs of the greenhouse gases” and to “note the importance of ensuring the integrity of all ecosystems, including oceans, and the protection of biodiversity, recognized by some cultures as Mother Earth”. It then includes in its Articles several references to nature-based solutions. For example, Article 5.2 encourages Parties to adopt “…policy approaches and positive incentives for activities relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and the role of conservation and sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries; and alternative policy approaches, such as joint mitigation and adaptation approaches for the integral and sustainable management of forests, while reaffirming the importance of incentivizing, as appropriate, non-carbon benefits associated with such approaches”. Article 7.1 further encourages Parties to build the resilience of socioeconomic and ecological systems, including through economic diversification and sustainable management of natural resources. In total, the Agreement refers to nature (ecosystems, natural resources, forests) in 13 distinct places. An in-depth analysis &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbspolicyplatform.org/|title=Nature-Based Solutions Policy Platform|website=www.nbspolicyplatform.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; of all Nationally Determined Contributions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unfccc.int/process/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions/ndc-registry|title=Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) {{!}} UNFCCC|website=unfccc.int|language=en|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; submitted to UNFCCC, revealed that around 130 NDCs or 65% of signatories commit to nature-based solutions in their climate pledges, suggesting broad consensus for the role of nature in helping meet climate change goals. However, high-level commitments rarely translate into robust, measurable actions on-the-ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=July 2016|title=Ecosystem-based adaptation: a win–win formula for sustainability in a warming world?|url=http://pubs.iied.org/17364IIED/?k=Ecosystem-based+Adaptation+EbA&amp;p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The term NBS was put forward by practitioners in the late 2000s (in particular the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|International Union for the Conservation of Nature]] and the [[World Bank]]) and thereafter by policymakers in Europe (most notably the [[European Commission]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Faivre|first=Nicolas|last2=Fritz|first2=Marco|last3=Freitas|first3=Tiago|last4=Boissezon|first4=Birgit de|last5=Vandewoestijne|first5=Sofie|title=Nature-Based Solutions in the EU: Innovating with nature to address social, economic and environmental challenges|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2017.08.032|journal=Environmental Research|volume=159|pages=509–518|doi=10.1016/j.envres.2017.08.032|bibcode=2017ER....159..509F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "nature-based solutions" was first used in the late 2000s.&lt;ref name="MacKinnon11"&gt;MacKinnon, K., C. Sobrevila, V. Hickey. 2008. Biodiversity, climate change and adaptation: nature-based solutions from the Word Bank portfolio. Washington D.C.: World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mittermeier12"&gt;Mittermeier, R. et al. 2008. A Climate For Life: Meeting the Global Challenge. Arlington, VA: International League of Conservation Photographers.&lt;/ref&gt; It was used in the context of finding new solutions to mitigate and adapt to climate change effects, whilst simultaneously protecting biodiversity and improving sustainable livelihoods.

The IUCN referred to NBS in a position paper for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature). 2009. No time to lose – make full use of nature-based solutions in the post-2012 climate change regime. Position paper on the Fifteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 15). Gland: IUCN.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was also adopted by European policymakers, in particular by the European Commission in a report&lt;ref name="European Commission 2015"&gt;European Commission. 2015. Towards an EU Research and Innovation policy agenda for nature-based solutions &amp; re-naturing cities. Final Report of the Horizon2020 Expert Group on Nature-Based Solutions and Re-Naturing Cities. Brussels: European Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; stressing that NBS can offer innovative means to create jobs and growth as part of a green economy. The term started to make appearances in the mainstream media around the time of the Global Climate Action Summit in California in September 2018 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nathalieseddon.blogspot.com/2018/09/global-climate-action-summit-kicks-off.html|title=Global Climate Action Summit kicks off today in San Francisco with nature-based solutions high on the agenda|website=Global Climate Action Summit kicks off today in San Francisco with nature-based solutions high on the agenda|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''natural environment''' encompasses all [[life|living]] and non-living things occurring [[nature|naturally]], meaning in this case not [[Artificiality|artificial]]. The term is most often applied to the [[Earth]] or some parts of Earth. This environment encompasses the interaction of all living [[species]], [[climate]], weather and natural resources that affect human survival and economic activity.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=D. L.|first2=S. H.|last2=Ambrose|first3=T. J.|last3=Bassett|first4=M. L.|last4=Bowen|first5=D. E.|last5=Crummey|first6=J. S.|last6=Isaacson|first7=D.

The concept of the ''natural environment'' can be distinguished as components:
* Complete [[ecological units]] that function as natural systems without massive civilized human intervention, including all vegetation, [[microorganism]]s, [[soil]], [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]], and [[natural phenomenon|natural phenomena]] that occur within their boundaries and their nature. 
* Universal [[natural resource]]s and [[physical phenomena]] that lack clear-cut boundaries, such as air, water, and climate, as well as [[energy]], [[radiation]], [[electric charge]], and [[magnetism]], not originating from civilized human actions.

In contrast to the natural environment is the [[built environment]]. In such areas where man has fundamentally transformed landscapes such as urban settings and agricultural [[land development|land conversion]], the natural environment is greatly modified into a simplified human environment.  Even acts which seem less extreme, such as building a mud [[hut]] or a [[photovoltaic system]] in the [[desert]], the modified environment becomes an artificial one.  Though many animals build things to provide a better environment for themselves, they are not human, hence [[beaver dam|beaver dams,]] and the works of [[Mound-building termites]], are thought of as natural.

People seldom find ''absolutely natural'' environments on Earth, and naturalness usually varies in a continuum, from 100% natural in one extreme to 0% natural in the other. More precisely, we can consider the different aspects or components of an environment, and see that their degree of naturalness is not uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Donald |last=Symons |title=The Evolution of Human Sexuality |page=31 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1979 |location=New York |isbn=0-19-502535-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If, for instance, in an agricultural field, the [[mineralogy|mineralogic composition]] and the [[soil structure|structure]] of its soil are similar to those of an undisturbed forest soil, but the structure is quite different.

''Natural environment'' is often used as a synonym for [[habitat]]. For instance, when we say that the natural environment of giraffes is the [[savanna]].

==Geological activity==
{{Main|Geology}}
The Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]], or [[lithosphere]], is the outermost solid surface of the planet and is chemically and mechanically different from underlying [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. It has been generated greatly by [[igneous]] processes in which [[magma]]  cools and solidifies to form solid rock. Beneath the lithosphere lies the mantle which is heated by the [[radioactive decay|decay]] of [[radioactive element]]s. The mantle though solid is in a state of [[rheid|rheic]] [[convection]]. This convection process causes the lithospheric plates to move, albeit slowly. The resulting process is known as [[plate tectonics]]. [[Volcanoes]] result primarily from the melting of [[Subduction|subducted]] crust material or of rising mantle at [[mid-ocean ridge]]s and [[mantle plume]]s.

==Water on Earth==
[[File:Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG|thumb|upright=0.55|right|&lt;center&gt;[[Coral reef]]s have significant marine [[biodiversity]].&lt;/center&gt;]]
Most water is found in one or another natural kind of [[body of water]].

=== Oceans ===
{{Main|Ocean}}
An [[ocean]] is a major body of [[Seawater|saline water]], and a component of the hydrosphere. Approximately 71% of the Earth's [[surface of the Earth|surface]] (an area of some 362 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a [[World Ocean|continuous body of water]] that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller [[sea]]s. More than half of this area is over 3,000 meters (9,800&amp;nbsp;ft) deep. Average oceanic [[salinity]] is around 35 [[parts per thousand]] (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt. Though generally recognized as several 'separate' oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the [[World Ocean]] or global ocean.&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web |url=http://www.pagejaffna.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714233027/http://www.pagejaffna.com/ |archivedate=2012-07-14 |df= }}".

The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the [[continent]]s, various [[archipelago]]s, and other criteria: these divisions are (in descending order of size) the [[Pacific Ocean]], the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[Indian Ocean]], the [[Southern Ocean]] and the [[Arctic Ocean]].

=== Rivers ===
{{Main|River}}
A river is a natural [[watercourse]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/river River {definition}] from Merriam-Webster. Accessed February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; usually [[freshwater]], flowing toward an [[ocean]], a [[lake]], a [[sea]] or another river.  A few rivers simply flow into the ground and dry up completely before reaching another body of water. 
[[File:Hawaii Creek.jpg|thumb|left|Rocky stream in the U.S. state of [[Hawaii]]]]

The water in a river is usually in a [[channel (geography)|channel]], made up of a [[stream bed]] between [[stream bank|banks]]. In larger rivers there is also a wider [[floodplain]] shaped by waters over-topping the channel. Flood plains may be very wide in relation to the size of the river channel. Rivers are a part of the [[hydrological cycle]]. Water within a river is generally collected from [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] through [[surface runoff]], [[groundwater recharge]], [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], and the release of water stored in [[glacier]]s and snowpacks.

Small rivers may also be termed by several other names, including [[stream]], creek and brook.  Their [[Current (stream)|current]] is confined within a [[stream bed|bed]] and [[stream bank]]s.  Streams play an important [[wildlife corridor|corridor]] role in connecting [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmented habitats]] and thus in conserving [[biodiversity]]. The study of streams and waterways in general is known as ''surface [[hydrology]].''&lt;ref&gt;http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/hydrology.html/  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813113503/http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/hydrology.html/ |date=August 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lakes ===
[[File:LAGO LACAR.JPG|thumb|right|[[Lácar Lake]], of [[glacier|glacial]] origin, in the {{province|Neuquén|Argentina}}.]]

{{Main|Lake}}

A lake (from Latin ''lacus'') is a [[terrain feature]], a body of water that is localized to the bottom of [[Depression (geology)|basin]].  A body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, is not part of an [[ocean]], and is larger and deeper than a [[pond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Lake (physical feature)
|quote=[a Lake is] any relatively large body of slowly moving or standing water that occupies an inland basin of appreciable size. Definitions that precisely distinguish lakes, ponds, swamps, and even rivers and other bodies of nonoceanic water are not established. It may be said, however, that rivers and streams are relatively fast moving; marshes and swamps contain relatively large quantities of grasses, trees, or shrubs; and ponds are relatively small in comparison to lakes. Geologically defined, lakes are temporary bodies of water.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|quote=a body of fresh or salt water of considerable size, surrounded by land.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Everglades Park swamp.JPG|thumb|left|A [[swamp]] area in [[Everglades National Park]], [[Florida]], [[US]].]]

Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in [[mountain]]ous areas, [[rift zone]]s, and areas with ongoing or recent [[glacier|glaciation]]. Other lakes are found in [[endorheic basin]]s or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last [[Ice Age]]. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.
{{clear}}

==== Ponds ====
{{Main|Pond}}
A pond is a [[body of water|body]] of [[Water stagnation|standing water]], either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a [[lake]]. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including [[water garden]]s designed for aesthetic ornamentation, [[fish pond]]s designed for commercial fish breeding, and [[solar pond]]s designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams by their [[Flow velocity|current speed]]. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as [[stream pool]]s and [[tide pool]]s.

=== Human impact on water ===
Humans impact the water in different ways such as modifying rivers (through [[dam]]s and [[Channelization (rivers)|stream channelization]]), [[urbanization]], and [[deforestation]]. These impact lake levels, groundwater conditions, water pollution, thermal pollution, and marine pollution. Humans modify rivers by using direct channel manipulation.&lt;ref name=Goudie&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Human Impact on the Natural Environment|last=Goudie|first=Andrew|publisher=This MIT Press|year=2000|isbn=0-262-57138-2|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=203 - 239}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are building dams and reservoirs and manipulating the direction of the rivers and water path. Dams are good for humans, some communities need the reservoirs to survive. However, reservoirs and dams may negatively impact the environment and wildlife. Dams stops fish migration and the moving of organisms down stream. Urbanization effects the environment because of deforestation and changing lake levels, groundwater conditions, etc. Deforestation and urbanization go hand in hand. Deforestation may cause flooding, declining stream flow, and changes in riverside vegetation. The changing vegetation occurs because when trees cannot get adequate water they start to deteriorate, leading to a decreased food supply for the wildlife in an area.&lt;ref name=Goudie/&gt;

== Atmosphere, climate and weather ==
[[File:Top of Atmosphere.jpg|thumb|right|Atmospheric gases [[Rayleigh scattering|scatter blue light more than other wavelengths]], creating a blue [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]] when seen from space.]]

The atmosphere of the Earth serves as a key factor in sustaining the planetary ecosystem. The thin layer of [[gas]]es that envelops the Earth is held in place by the planet's gravity. Dry [[air]] consists of 78% [[nitrogen]], 21% [[oxygen]], 1% [[argon]] and other [[inert gases]], such as [[carbon dioxide]]. The remaining gases are often referred to as trace gases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Joe Buchdahl |url=http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/Atmosphere/Older/Trace_Gases.html |title=Atmosphere, Climate &amp; Environment Information Programme |publisher=Ace.mmu.ac.uk |accessdate=2013-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009044345/http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/atmosphere/older/Trace_Gases.html |archivedate=2010-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; among which are the [[greenhouse gas]]es such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Filtered air includes trace amounts of many other [[chemical compound]]s. Air also contains a variable amount of [[water vapor]] and [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspensions]] of water droplets and [[ice]] crystals seen as [[cloud]]s. Many natural substances may be present in tiny amounts in an unfiltered air sample, including [[dust]], [[pollen]] and [[spores]], [[sea spray]], [[volcanic ash]], and [[meteoroid]]s. Various industrial [[pollutant]]s also may be present, such as [[chlorine]] (elementary or in compounds), [[fluorine]] compounds, elemental [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[sulphur]] compounds such as [[sulphur dioxide]] [SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;].

The [[ozone layer]] of the Earth's atmosphere plays an important role in depleting the amount of [[ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As [[DNA]] is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.

===Layers of the Atmosphere===
{{Main|Earth's atmosphere}}

====Principal layers====
Earth's atmosphere can be divided into five main layers. These layers are mainly determined by whether temperature increases or decreases with altitude. From highest to lowest, these layers are:
* [[Exosphere]]: The outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere extends from the exobase upward, mainly composed of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]].
* [[Thermosphere]]: The top of the thermosphere is the bottom of the exosphere, called the [[exobase]]. Its height varies with solar activity and ranges from about {{convert|350|-|800|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}. The [[International Space Station]] orbits in this layer, between {{convert|320|and|380|km|mi|abbr=on}}.
* [[Mesosphere]]: The mesosphere extends from the stratopause to {{convert|80|-|85|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}. It is the layer where most [[meteor]]s burn up upon entering the atmosphere.
* [[Stratosphere]]: The stratosphere extends from the tropopause to about {{convert|51|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}. The [[stratopause]], which is the boundary between the stratosphere and mesosphere, typically is at {{convert|50|to|55|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}.
* [[Troposphere]]: The troposphere begins at the surface and extends to between {{convert|7|km|ft|abbr=on}} at the poles and {{convert|17|km|ft|abbr=on}} at the equator, with some variation due to weather. The troposphere is mostly heated by transfer of energy from the surface, so on average the lowest part of the troposphere is warmest and temperature decreases with altitude. The [[tropopause]] is the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere.

; Other layers
Within the five principal layers determined by temperature there are several layers determined by other properties.
* The [[ozone layer]] is contained within the stratosphere. It is mainly located in the lower portion of the stratosphere from about {{convert|15|-|35|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}, though the thickness varies seasonally and geographically. About 90% of the ozone in our atmosphere is contained in the stratosphere.
* The [[ionosphere]], the part of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation, stretches from {{convert|50|to|1000|km|mi ft|abbr=on}} and typically overlaps both the exosphere and the thermosphere. It forms the inner edge of the magnetosphere.
* The [[homosphere]] and [[heterosphere]]: The homosphere includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere. The upper part of the heterosphere is composed almost completely of hydrogen, the lightest element.
* The [[planetary boundary layer]] is the part of the troposphere that is nearest the Earth's surface and is directly affected by it, mainly through [[turbulence|turbulent diffusion]].

====Effects of global warming====
[[File:Gletscherschmelze.jpg|thumb|left|The Retreat of glaciers since 1850 of [[Aletsch Glacier]] in the [[Swiss Alps]] (situation in 1979, 1991 and 2002), due to [[global warming]].]]
{{Main|Effects of global warming}}

The dangers of [[global warming]] are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how [[climate change]] and global warming caused by [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]], or human-made releases of [[greenhouse gas]]es, most notably [[carbon dioxide]], can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/view/climate-change-75518/home|title=Climate Change|website=sites.google.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Forthofer|first=Ron|title=It's Time To Act On Global Warming|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views01/0218-08.htm|publisher=Boulder Daily Camera|accessdate=2013-10-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616203811/http://www.commondreams.org/views01/0218-08.htm|archivedate=2013-06-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Efforts have been increasingly focused on the [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigation]] of greenhouse gases that are causing climatic changes, on [[Adaptation to global warming|developing adaptative strategies]] to global warming, to assist humans, other animal, and plant species, ecosystems, regions and [[nation]]s in adjusting to the [[effects of global warming]]. Some examples of recent collaboration to address climate change and global warming include:

[[File:Aletschgletsjer Zwitserland.JPG|right|thumb|Another view of the [[Aletsch Glacier]] in the [[Swiss Alps]] and because of [[global warming]] it has been decreasing]]
* The [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|United Nations Framework Convention Treaty]] and convention on Climate Change, to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://unfccc.int/2860.php United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] Retrieved August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Kyoto Protocol]], which is the protocol to the international Framework Convention on Climate Change treaty, again with the objective of reducing greenhouse gases in an effort to prevent anthropogenic climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/kpeng.html Kyoto Protocol] from [http://unfccc.int/2860.php United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change], Retrieved August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Western Climate Initiative]], to identify, evaluate, and implement collective and cooperative ways to reduce greenhouse gases in the region, focusing on a market-based cap-and-trade system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westernclimateinitiative.org/ Western Climate Initiative], Retrieved on Feb 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A significantly profound challenge is to identify the natural environmental dynamics in contrast to environmental changes not within natural variances. A common solution is to adapt a static view neglecting natural variances to exist. Methodologically, this view could be defended when looking at processes which change slowly and short time series, while the problem arrives when fast processes turns essential in the object of the study.

Weather refers, generally, to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas [[climate]] is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Climate | encyclopedia = Glossary of Meteorology | publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]] | url = http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=climate1 | accessdate = 2008-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When used without qualification, "weather" is understood to be the weather of [[Earth]].

Weather occurs due to density (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another. These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the [[jet stream]]. Weather systems in the [[mid-latitudes]], such as [[extratropical cyclone]]s, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth's [[Earth's rotation|axis]] is tilted relative to its orbital plane, [[sunlight]] is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On the Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40&amp;nbsp;°C (100&amp;nbsp;°F to −40&amp;nbsp;°F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in the Earth's orbit have affected the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate

Surface [[temperature]] differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] for a future time and a given location. The [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] is a [[chaos theory|chaotic system]], and small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to [[weather control|control the weather]] have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that civilized human activity such as [[agriculture]] and [[industry]] has inadvertently modified weather patterns.

{{Main|Life|Biology|Biosphere}}

Evidence suggests that [[life|life on Earth]] has existed for about 3.7 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] years.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/exhibits/historyoflife.php History of life through time]". University of California Museum of Paleontology.&lt;/ref&gt; All known life forms share fundamental molecular mechanisms, and based on these observations, theories on the origin of life attempt to find a mechanism explaining the formation of a primordial single cell organism from which all life originates. There are many different hypotheses regarding the path that might have been taken from simple [[organic molecule]]s via pre-cellular life to protocells and metabolism.

Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by [[Organism|organization]], [[metabolism]], [[cell growth|growth]], [[adaptation]], response to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] and [[reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2006 |url=http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |title=Definition of Life |publisher=California Academy of Sciences |accessdate=2007-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208220940/http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |archivedate=2007-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of [[organism]]s.

An [[ecosystem]] (also called as environment) is a natural unit consisting of all plants, animals and micro-organisms ([[biotic component|biotic]] factors) in an area functioning together with all of the non-living physical ([[abiotic]]) factors of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert W. |last=Christopherson |year=1996 |title=Geosystems: An Introduction to Physical Geography |publisher=Prentice Hall |location= |isbn=0-13-505314-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that [[living organism]]s are continually engaged in a highly interrelated set of relationships with every other element constituting the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] in which they exist. [[Eugene Odum]], one of the founders of the science of [[ecology]], stated: "Any unit that includes all of the organisms (i.e.: the "community") in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Odum |first=E. P. |year=1971 |title=Fundamentals of Ecology |edition=Third |publisher=Saunders |location=New York |isbn=0-7216-6941-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Creek and old-growth forest-Larch Mountain.jpg|thumb|right|[[Old-growth forest]] and a [[creek (tidal)|creek]] on [[Larch Mountain (Multnomah County, Oregon)|Larch Mountain]], in the U.S. state of [[Oregon]].]] The human ecosystem concept is then grounded in the deconstruction of the human/nature [[dichotomy]], and the emergent premise that all species are ecologically integrated with each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their [[biotope]].

A greater number or variety of species or [[Biodiversity|biological diversity]] of an ecosystem may contribute to greater resilience of an ecosystem, because there are more species present at a location to respond to change and thus "absorb" or reduce its effects. This reduces the effect before the ecosystem's structure is fundamentally changed to a different state. This is not universally the case and there is no proven relationship between the species diversity of an ecosystem and its ability to provide goods and services on a sustainable level.

The term ecosystem can also pertain to human-made environments, such as [[human ecosystem]]s and human-influenced ecosystems, and can describe any situation where there is relationship between living organisms and their environment. Fewer areas on the surface of the earth today exist free from human contact, although some genuine [[wilderness]] areas continue to exist without any forms of human intervention.

==Biomes==
[[File:Vegetation-no-legend.PNG|thumb|right|Map of Terrestrial [[biomes]] classified by vegetation.]]
{{Main|Biome}}

[[Biomes]] are terminologically similar to the concept of ecosystems, and are [[Climate|climatically]] and geographically defined areas of ecologically similar climatic conditions on the [[Earth]], such as [[Community (ecology)|communities]] of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and [[Soil biology|soil organisms]], often referred to ''as'' ecosystems. Biomes are defined on the basis of factors such as plant structures (such as trees, shrubs, and grasses), leaf types (such as broadleaf and needleleaf), plant spacing (forest, woodland, savanna), and climate. Unlike [[ecozone]]s, biomes are not defined by genetic, taxonomic, or historical similarities. Biomes are often identified with particular patterns of [[ecological succession]] and [[climax vegetation]].

==Biogeochemical cycles==
[[File:Plagiomnium affine laminazellen.jpeg|thumb|[[Chloroplasts]] conduct [[photosynthesis]] and are found in [[plant cell]]s and other [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organisms. These are Chloroplasts visible in the cells of ''Plagiomnium affine'' — Many-fruited Thyme-moss.]]
{{Main|Biogeochemical cycles}}

Global [[biogeochemical cycle]]s are critical to life, most notably those of [[water]], [[oxygen]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]].&lt;ref&gt;Smil, V. (2000). ''Cycles of Life''. New York: Scientific American Library. {{ISBN|978-0-7167-5079-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[nitrogen cycle]] is the transformation of nitrogen and nitrogen-containing compounds in nature. It is a cycle which includes gaseous components.
* The [[water cycle]], is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. Water can change states among liquid, vapour, and ice at various places in the water cycle. Although the balance of water on Earth remains fairly constant over time, individual water molecules can come and go.
* The [[carbon cycle]] is the biogeochemical cycle by which carbon is exchanged among the biosphere, pedosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere of the Earth.
* The [[oxygen cycle]] is the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the [[lithosphere]]. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is [[photosynthesis]], which is responsible for the modern Earth's atmospheric composition and life.
* The [[phosphorus cycle]] is the movement of phosphorus through the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. The atmosphere does not play a significant role in the movements of phosphorus, because phosphorus and phosphorus compounds are usually solids at the typical ranges of temperature and pressure found on Earth.

==Wilderness==

{{Main|Wilderness}}

[[Wilderness]] is generally defined as a natural environment on [[Earth]] that has not been significantly modified by [[human]] activity. The [[WILD Foundation]] goes into more detail, defining wilderness as: "The most intact, undisturbed wild natural areas left on our planet - those last truly wild places that humans do not control and have not developed with roads, pipelines or other industrial infrastructure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wild.org/main/about/what-is-a-wilderness-area/ |title=The WILD Foundation |publisher=Wild.org |accessdate=2013-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121204162126/http://www.wild.org/main/about/what-is-a-wilderness-area/ |archivedate=2012-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilderness areas and protected [[parks]] are considered important for the survival of certain [[species]], ecological studies, [[Habitat conservation|conservation]], solitude, and [[recreation]]. Wilderness is deeply valued for cultural, spiritual, [[moral]], and [[aesthetic]] reasons. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;No Man's Garden by Daniel B. Botkin p155-157&lt;/ref&gt;

The word, "wilderness", derives from the notion of [[wildness]]; in other words that which is not controllable by humans. The word's [[etymology]] is from the [[Old English]] ''wildeornes'', which in turn derives from ''wildeor'' meaning ''wild beast'' (wild + deor = beast, deer).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/wilderness wilderness]. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved November 29, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; From this point of view, it is the wildness of a place that makes it a wilderness. The mere presence or activity of people does not disqualify an area from being "wilderness." Many ecosystems that are, or have been, inhabited or influenced by activities of people may still be considered "wild." This way of looking at wilderness includes areas within which natural processes operate without very noticeable human interference.

[[Wildlife]] includes all non-[[domesticated]] plants, animals and other organisms. Domesticating wild plant and animal species for human benefit has occurred many times all over the planet, and has a major impact on the environment, both positive and negative. Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, rain forests, plains, and other areas—including the most developed [[Urban area|urban]] sites—all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by civilized human factors, most scientists agree that wildlife around the world is (now) impacted by human activities.

{{See also|List of environmental issues|World Scientists' Warning to Humanity}}
It is the common understanding of ''natural environment'' that underlies [[environmentalism]] — a broad [[politics|political]], [[sociology|social]], and [[philosophy|philosophical]] movement that advocates various actions and policies in the interest of protecting what nature remains in the natural environment, or restoring or expanding the role of nature in this environment. While true wilderness is increasingly rare, ''wild'' nature (e.g., unmanaged [[forests]], uncultivated [[grasslands]], [[wildlife]], [[wildflower]]s) can be found in many locations previously inhabited by humans.

Goals for the benefit of people and natural systems, commonly expressed by [[environmental scientist]]s and [[environmentalist]]s include:

* Elimination of [[pollution]] and [[toxicant]]s in air, water, soil, buildings, manufactured goods, and food.
* Preservation of [[biodiversity]] and protection of [[endangered species]].
* [[Conservation movement|Conservation]] and [[sustainable use]] of resources such as [[water]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Escolero, O. |author2=Kralisch, S. |author3=Martínez, S.E. |author4=Perevochtchikova, M.|year=2016|title=Diagnóstico y análisis de los factores que influyen en la vulnerabilidad de las fuentes de abastecimiento de agua potable a la Ciudad de México, México|url=http://boletinsgm.igeolcu.unam.mx/bsgm/vols/epoca04/6803/%283%29Escolero.pdf|journal=Boletín de la Sociedad Geológica Mexicana|language=Spanish|volume=68|issue=3|pages=409–427}}&lt;/ref&gt; land, air, energy, raw materials, and natural resources.
* Halting human-induced [[global warming]], which represents pollution, a threat to biodiversity, and a threat to human populations.
* Shifting from [[fossil fuels]] to [[renewable energy]] in electricity, heating and cooling, and transportation, which addresses pollution, global warming, and sustainability.  This may include [[public transportation]] and [[distributed generation]], which have benefits for traffic congestion and electric reliability.
* Shifting from meat-intensive diets to largely plant-based diets in order to help mitigate [[biodiversity loss]] and climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Drayer|first=Lisa|date=January 2, 2019 |title=Change your diet to combat climate change in 2019|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/18/health/plant-based-diet-climate-change-food-drayer/index.html|work=CNN |location= |access-date=February 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Establishment of [[nature reserve]]s for recreational purposes and ecosystem preservation.
* Sustainable and less polluting [[waste management]] including [[waste reduction]] (or even [[zero waste]]), [[reuse]], [[recycling]], [[composting]], [[waste-to-energy]], and [[anaerobic digestion]] of sewage sludge.
*Slowing and stabilisation of [[human population growth]].

==Criticism==
In some cultures the term environment is meaningless because there is no separation between people and what they view as the natural world, or their surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Jamieson, Dale. (2007). The Heart of Environmentalism. In R. Sandler &amp; P. C. Pezzullo. Environmental Justice and Environmentalism. (pp. 85-101). Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically in the United States, many native cultures do not recognize the "environment", or see themselves as environmentalists.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, T.

'''''Final Straw: Food, Earth, Happiness''''' is a documentary/art film released in June 2015 that takes audiences through farms and urban landscapes in [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], and the [[United States]], interviewing leading practitioners in the [[Natural farming|Natural Farming]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hong|first=Ryoseok|title=Final Straw: Food, Earth, Happiness|date=2000-01-01|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3709036/|last2=Kawaguchi|last3=Korn|first2=Yoshikazu|first3=Larry|accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film began when an environmental artist (Patrick M. Lydon) and an environmental book editor (Suhee Kang), had a chance meeting in Seoul, South Korea, and began conducting short interviews together with leaders in the ecology and social justice movements. Upon meeting Korean farmer Seong Hyun Choi however, the two were so impressed by his ecological mindset and way of working, that they set out to produce a feature film about the movement. Lydon and Kang ended up quitting their jobs, giving away most of their possessions, and becoming voluntarily homeless for four years in order to afford producing the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kimchiandbasil.com/interview-final-straw/|title=Final straw: food, earth, happiness - Kimchi&amp;Basil|date=2016-02-20|work=Kimchi&amp;Basil|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/a-root-solution/|title=A ‘Root’ Solution {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/12/21/lydon-ghost-ship-raises-broad-questions-about-art-and-culture/|title=Lydon: Ghost Ship raises big questions about arts and culture|last=|first=|date=|website=San Jose Mercury News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is split into three sections 1) Modern Life, 2) Foundations and Mindset of Natural Farming, and 3) Natural Farming in Practice and Life. According to the filmmakers, as they began to understand more about how natural farming itself was not rooted in methods, but in a way of thinking, they chose to explore the life philosophies and ways of thinking of natural farming practitioners in a more free-flowing and artistic way, rather than an instructive one; the result is an unconventional documentary that features slow paced musical interludes alongside interviews. Reviewers have called both "meditative, and mindful," and "an inspiring call to action."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mindfulpie.com/one-straw-revolution/|title=Love nature, eat well – Mindful Pie|website=mindfulpie.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cleaneatingmag.com/|title=Eco Farming|last=|first=|date=July 1, 2015|work=Clean Eating Magazine|access-date=August 1, 2015|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=Active Interest Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author and musician [[Alicia Bay Laurel]] called the film "both art and documentary".

== Production ==
Lydon and Kang spent what they call a "meager" life savings to make the film, along with the volunteer efforts of farmers, translators, writers, musicians they had met during their journey. Although the film was filmed, written, and edited entirely by the two directors, they readily admit that the process of making the film was co-operative effort, with more than 200 volunteers directly involved in the process in some way. The soundtrack was recorded with professional musicians from each of the three countries where filming took place, all of whom donated their time to contribute to the film project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/film-soundtrack-recording-with-windsync/|title=Film Soundtrack Recording with WindSync {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the continued help of international volunteers, the film is available in four languages (English, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese), and three more (Chinese, Portuguese, French) are in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cbjournalism.com/2016/03/24/filmmaker-spotlight-patrick-lydon-suhee-king/|title=Filmmaker Spotlight: Patrick Lydon &amp; Suhee King|date=2016-03-24|website=Chelsea Breaks the News|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/film-soundtrack-recording-with-windsync/|title=Film Soundtrack Recording with WindSync {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/the-documentary/|title=The Documentary {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tour and critical reception ==

Frustrated by the lack of distribution and film festival options for low- and no-budget films, the filmmakers made the decision to manage distribution and touring in the same way they went about filming, through co-operative effort. With the help of volunteers, independent theater owners, and community organizers, they launched an extensive tour throughout Japan and South Korea from 2015-2016, eventually screening the film at over 130 venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/tour-dates-and-screenings/|title=Tour Dates and Screenings {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than simply screening the film, the filmmakers decided to transition their existing media production organization ''SocieCity,'' into a vehicle for art and community engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artseverywhere.ca/2016/03/07/social-practice-artwork-a-restaurant-and-garden-serving-up-connections-to-urban-nature/|title=Social Practice Artwork: A Restaurant and Garden Serving up Connections to Urban Nature|last=|first=|date=|website=artseverywhere.ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They made a point of hosting interactive events along with their screenings and in several cases, stayed in communities for up to three months at a time to build natural gardens and host a project they call REALtimeFOOD, a grown-to-order restaurant which connects the ideas from the film with real-world practices in farming, food, and crafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.naver.com/barndining_/220514125842|title=Bar&amp;Dining Magazine : 네이버 블로그|website=blog.naver.com|language=ko|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://setouchiexplorer.com/real-time-food-project-day-one-worlds-slowest-restaurant-opening/|title=REAL time FOOD Project - Day One - World's Slowest Restaurant Opening|date=2016-09-18|work=Setouchi Explorer|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, these efforts were funded by grants from local philanthropic organizations and/or supported by the communities themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chishimatochi.info/found/index.php/archives/service/1961|title=おおさか創造千島財団  » 2015年度|website=www.chishimatochi.info|language=ja|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sustainablepractice.org/2013/11/15/final-straw/|title=Final Straw|date=2013-11-15|website=The CSPA|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interested in the unconventional way the film was being made and toured, multiple magazines and newspapers in Japan and Korea followed the directors during several parts of their journey, notably ESSEN, Bar and Dining, and Road magazines, and Shikoku Shinbun and Huffington Post newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shikoku-newspaper-english.pdf|title=Connecting to Life with Natural Farming in Megijima|last=|first=|date=September 18, 2016|work=Shikoku Shinbun|access-date=17 April 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.kr/salimstory/story_b_8476176.html|title="모든 것이 연결되어 있다는 깨달음이 시작"|website=허핑턴포스트|language=ko-KR|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://navercast.naver.com/magazine_contents.nhn?rid=1095&amp;contents_id=45426|title=내일의 식문화를 일구는 사람들이 보내 온 새해 편지|access-date=2017-04-18|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the tour, the film was eventually picked up by festivals including Tassie Eco Film Festival and Belleville Doc Fest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://downtowndocfest.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Belleville%20Downtown%20DocFest%20Program_2016.pdf|title=Belleville International Documentary Festival - Official Program|last=|first=|date=1 February 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''balance of nature''' is a theory that proposes that ecological systems are usually in a stable equilibrium or [[homeostasis]], which is to say that a small change in some particular parameter (the size of a particular population, for example) will be corrected by some [[negative feedback]] that will bring the parameter back to its original "point of balance" with the rest of the system.  It may apply where populations depend on each other, for example in predator/prey systems, or relationships between herbivores and their food source.  It is also sometimes applied to the relationship between the Earth's ecosystem, the composition of the atmosphere, and the world's weather.

The [[Gaia hypothesis]] is a balance of nature-based theory that suggests that the Earth and its ecology may act as co-ordinated systems in order to maintain the balance of nature.

The theory that nature is permanently in balance has been largely discredited by scientists working in [[ecology]], as it has been found that chaotic changes in population levels are common, but nevertheless the idea continues to be popular in the general public.&lt;ref name="Zim"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://pus.sagepub.com/content/16/4/393.abstract| title=Ambiguous, circular and polysemous: students' definitions of the "balance of nature" metaphor| journal=Public Understanding of Science| date=October 2007| first=Corinne| last= Zimmerman| volume= 16| number= 4| pages=393–406| doi= 10.1177/0963662505063022| accessdate=19 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kricher2009&gt;{{cite book| author=Kricher, John | year=2009 | title=The Balance of Nature: Ecology's Enduring Myth | publisher=Princeton University Press | isbn=978-0691138985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the later half of the twentieth century the theory was superseded by [[catastrophe theory]] and [[chaos theory]].

==History of the theory==
The concept that nature maintains its condition is of ancient provenance; [[Herodotus]] commented on the wonderful relationship between predator and prey species, which remained in a steady proportion to one another, with predators never excessively consuming their prey populations.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "balance of nature" concept once ruled ecological research, as well as once governing the management of natural resources. This led to a [[doctrine]] popular among some [[conservation movement|conservationist]]s that nature was best left to its own devices, and that [[human]] intervention into it was by definition unacceptable.&lt;ref name="NY"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/31/science/new-eye-on-nature-the-real-constant-is-eternal-turmoil.html| title=New Eye on Nature: The Real Constant Is Eternal Turmoil| newspaper=The New York Times| first=William K. |last=Stevens| date=31 July 1990| accessdate=19 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The validity of a "balance of nature" was already questioned in the early 1900s, but the general abandonment of the theory by scientists working in [[ecology]] only happened in the last quarter of that century when studies showed that it did not match what could be observed among plant and animal populations.&lt;ref name=Kricher2009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Heneghan, Liam | url=https://aeon.co/essays/nature-is-out-of-balance-but-it-s-still-worth-saving |title=Out of kilter | publisher=aeon | date=9 October 2012  | accessdate=16 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predator prey interactions==
Predator-prey populations tend to show [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] behavior within limits, where the sizes of populations change in a way that may appear random, but is in fact obeying [[Determinism|deterministic]] laws based only on the relationship between a population and its food source illustrated by the [[Lotka–Volterra equation]].  An experimental example of this was shown in an eight-year study on small [[Baltic Sea]] creatures such as [[plankton]], which were isolated from the rest of the ocean. Each member of the [[food web]] was shown to take turns multiplying and declining, even though the scientists kept the outside conditions constant. An article in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' stated; "Advanced mathematical techniques proved the indisputable presence of chaos in this food web ... short-term prediction is possible, but long-term prediction is not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human intervention==
Although some conservationist organizations argue that human activity is incompatible with a balanced ecosystem, there are numerous examples in history showing that several modern day habitats originate from human activity: some of Latin America's rain forests owe their existence to humans planting and transplanting them, while the abundance of grazing animals in the [[Serengeti]] plain of Africa is thought by some ecologists to be partly due to human-set fires that created [[savanna]] habitats.&lt;ref name="NY" /&gt;

Possibly one of the best examples of an ecosystem fundamentally modified by human activity can be observed as a consequence of the Australian [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] practice of "[[Fire-stick farming]]". The legacy of this practice over long periods has resulted in forests being converted to grasslands capable of sustaining larger populations of faunal prey, particularly in the northern and western regions of the continent. So thorough has been the effect of these deliberate regular burnings that many plant and tree species from affected regions have now completely adapted to the annual fire regime in that they require the passage of a fire before their seeds will even germinate. One school in Los Angeles states, " “We have let our kids go to the forest area of the playground. However, five years later, we found that none of the flowers were growing, the natural damp soil had been hardened, and all of the beautiful grass had been plucked,”.

==Continued popularity of the theory==
Despite being discredited among ecologists, the theory is widely held to be true by the general public, with one authority calling it an "enduring myth".&lt;ref name=Kricher2009/&gt; At least in [[Midwestern America]], the "balance of nature" idea was shown to be widely held by both science majors and the general student population.&lt;ref name="Zim" /&gt; In a study at the [[University of Patras]], educational sciences students were asked to reason about the future of ecosystems which suffered human-driven disturbances. Subjects agreed that it was very likely for the ecosystems to fully recover their initial state, referring to either a 'recovery process' which restores the initial 'balance', or specific 'recovery mechanisms' as an ecosystem's inherent characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ergazaki|first=Marida|last2=Ampatzidis|first2=Georgios|date=2012-06-01|title=Students' Reasoning about the Future of Disturbed or Protected Ecosystems &amp;amp; the Idea of the 'Balance of Nature'|journal=Research in Science Education|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=511–530|doi=10.1007/s11165-011-9208-7|issn=0157-244X|bibcode=2012RScEd..42..511E}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2017 study, Ampatzidis and Ergazaki discuss the learning objectives and design criteria that a learning environment for non-biology major students should meet to support them challenge the "balance of nature" idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ampatzidis|first=Georgios|last2=Ergazaki|first2=Marida|date=2017-10-01|title=Toward an "Anti-Balance of Nature" Learning Environment for Non-Biology Major Students: Learning Objectives and Design Criteria|url=https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/nse/abstracts/46/1/170016|journal=Natural Sciences Education|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|doi=10.4195/nse2017.07.0016|issn=1059-9053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology==
{{Main|History of Earth}}

===Formation===
[[File:Protoplanetary-disk.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of the early Solar System's planetary disk]]
The oldest material found in the [[Solar System]] is dated to {{val|4.5672|0.0006|ul=billion years ago}} (Bya).&lt;ref name=bowring_housch1995/&gt; By {{val|4.54|0.04|u=Bya}}&lt;ref name="age_earth1" /&gt; the primordial Earth had formed. The bodies in [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|the Solar System formed and evolved]] with the Sun. In theory, a [[solar nebula]] partitions a volume out of a [[molecular cloud]] by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin and flatten into a [[circumstellar disk]], and then the planets grow out of that disk with the Sun. A nebula contains gas, ice grains, and [[Cosmic dust|dust]] (including [[primordial nuclide]]s). According to [[nebular theory]], [[planetesimal]]s formed by [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]], with the primordial Earth taking 10–{{val|20|ul=million years}} (Mys) to form.&lt;ref name=nature418_6901_949/&gt;

A subject of research is the formation of the Moon, some 4.53 Bya.&lt;ref name=science310_5754_1671/&gt; A leading hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a [[Mars]]-sized object, named [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], [[giant impact hypothesis|hit]] Earth.&lt;ref name=reilly20091022/&gt; In this view, the mass of Theia was approximately 10 percent of Earth,&lt;ref name=canup_asphaug2001a/&gt; it hit Earth with a glancing blow and some of its mass merged with Earth.&lt;ref name=canup_asphaug2001b/&gt; Between approximately 4.1 and {{val|3.8|u=Bya}}, numerous [[Impact event|asteroid impacts]] during the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon and, by inference, to that of Earth.

===Geological history===
{{Main|Geological history of Earth}}
[[File:USA 10654 Bryce Canyon Luca Galuzzi 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Hoodoo (geology)|Hoodoos]] at the [[Bryce Canyon National Park]], [[Utah]]]]

Earth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by [[Volcano|volcanic activity]] and [[outgassing]]. Water vapor from these sources [[origin of the world's oceans|condensed]] into the oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids, [[protoplanet]]s, and [[comet]]s.&lt;ref name="watersource"/&gt; In [[faint young Sun paradox|this model]], atmospheric "[[greenhouse gas]]es" kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70% of its [[solar luminosity|current luminosity]].&lt;ref name=asp2002/&gt; By {{val|3.5|u=Bya}}, [[Earth's magnetic field]] was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the [[solar wind]].&lt;ref name=physorg20100304/&gt;

A crust formed when the molten outer layer of Earth cooled [[Phase transition|to form]] a solid. The two models&lt;ref name=williams_santosh2004/&gt; that explain land mass propose either a steady growth to the present-day forms&lt;ref name=science164_1229/&gt; or, more likely, a rapid growth&lt;ref name=tp322_19/&gt; early in Earth history&lt;ref name=rg6_175/&gt; followed by a long-term steady continental area.&lt;ref name=science310_5756_1947/&gt;&lt;ref name=jaes23_799/&gt;&lt;ref name=ajes38_613/&gt; Continents formed by [[plate tectonics]], a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from Earth's interior. Over [[Geologic time scale|the period]] of hundreds of millions of years, the [[supercontinent]]s have assembled and broken apart. Roughly {{val|750|u=million years ago}} (Mya), one of the earliest known supercontinents, [[Rodinia]], began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form [[Pannotia]] {{val|600|–|540|u=Mya}}, then finally [[Pangaea]], which also broke apart {{val|180|u=Mya}}.&lt;ref name=as92_324/&gt;

The present pattern of [[ice age]]s began about {{val|40|u=Mya}} and then intensified during the [[Pleistocene]] about {{val|3|u=Mya}}. High-[[latitude]] regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating about every {{val|40000|-|100000|u=years|fmt=commas}}.

During the [[Neoproterozoic]], {{val|750|to|580|u=Mya}}, much of Earth might have been covered in ice. This hypothesis has been termed "[[Snowball Earth]]", and it is of particular interest because it preceded the [[Cambrian explosion]], when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity.&lt;ref name=kirschvink1992 /&gt; Following the Cambrian explosion, {{val|535|u=Mya}}, there have been five [[Extinction event|mass extinctions]].&lt;ref name="sci215_4539_1501" /&gt; The [[Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event|most recent such event]] was {{val|66|u=Mya}}, when [[Chicxulub impactor|an asteroid impact]] triggered the extinction of the non-[[bird|avian]] [[dinosaur]]s and other large reptiles, but spared some small animals such as [[mammal]]s, which at the time resembled [[shrew]]s.

===Future===
{{Main|Future of Earth}}
{{See also|Global catastrophic risk}}
Earth's expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun. Over the next {{val|1.1|u=Bys}}, solar luminosity will increase by 10%, and over the next {{val|3.5|u=Bys}} by 40%.&lt;ref name="sun_future"/&gt; The Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the [[inorganic]] [[carbon cycle]], reducing [[Carbon dioxide|{{chem2|CO2}}]] concentration to levels lethally low for plants ({{val|10|ul=ppm}} for [[C4 carbon fixation|C4 photosynthesis]]) in approximately {{val|500|–|900|u=Mys}}.&lt;ref name="britt2000" /&gt; The lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, making animal life impossible.&lt;ref name=ward_brownlee2002/&gt; After another billion years all surface water will have disappeared&lt;ref name=carrington/&gt; and the mean global temperature will reach {{convert|70|C|F|0}}.&lt;ref name=ward_brownlee2002/&gt; From that point, the Earth is expected to be habitable for another {{val|500|u=Myr}},&lt;ref name="britt2000"/&gt; possibly up to {{val|2.3|u=Ga}} if nitrogen is removed from the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=pnas1_24_9576/&gt; Even if the Sun were eternal and stable, 27% of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] in one billion years, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges.&lt;ref name=hess5_4_569/&gt;

The Sun will [[stellar evolution|evolve]] to become a [[red giant]] in about {{val|5|u=Bys}}. Models predict that the Sun will expand to roughly {{convert|1|AU|e6km e6mi|lk=in|abbr=unit}}, about 250 times its present radius.&lt;ref name="sun_future" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sun_future_schroder"/&gt; Earth's fate is less clear. As a red giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, Earth will move to an orbit {{convert|1.7|AU|e6km e6mi|lk=off|abbr=unit}} from the Sun when the star reaches its maximum radius. Most, if not all, remaining life will be destroyed by the Sun's increased luminosity (peaking at about 5,000 times its present level).&lt;ref name="sun_future" /&gt; A 2008 simulation indicates that Earth's orbit will eventually decay due to [[Tidal acceleration|tidal effects]] and drag, causing it to enter the Sun's atmosphere and be [[Vaporization|vaporized]].&lt;ref name="sun_future_schroder" /&gt;

{{Main|Figure of the Earth|Earth radius|Earth's circumference}}
The shape of Earth is approximately [[oblate spheroid]]al. Due to [[rotation]], the Earth is flattened at the poles and [[equatorial bulge|bulging]] around the [[equator]].&lt;ref name=milbert_smith96/&gt; The diameter of the Earth at the equator is {{convert|43|km|mi}} larger than the [[Geographical pole|pole]]-to-pole diameter.&lt;ref name="ngdc2006"/&gt; Thus the point on the surface farthest from Earth's [[center of mass]] is the summit of the equatorial [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]] volcano in [[Ecuador]] ({{Convert|6384.4|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref name=ps20_5_16/&gt;&lt;ref name=lancet365_9462_831/&gt;&lt;ref name=tall_tales/&gt;&lt;ref name="The 'Highest' Spot on Earth"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9428163 |title=The 'Highest' Spot on Earth |publisher=NPR |date=7 April 2007 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average diameter of the reference spheroid is {{convert|12742|km|mi}}. Local [[topography]] deviates from this idealized spheroid, although on a global scale these deviations are small compared to Earth's radius: The maximum deviation of only 0.17% is at the [[Mariana Trench]] ({{convert|10911|m|ft}} below local sea level), whereas [[Mount Everest]] ({{convert|8848|m|ft}} above local sea level) represents a deviation of 0.14%.{{refn|group=n| If Earth were shrunk to the size of a [[billiard ball]], some areas of Earth such as large mountain ranges and oceanic trenches would feel like tiny imperfections, whereas much of the planet, including the [[Great Plains]] and the [[abyssal plain]]s, would feel smoother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://billiards.colostate.edu/bd_articles/2013/june13.pdf |title=Is a Pool Ball Smoother than the Earth? |publisher=Billiards Digest |date=1 June 2013 |accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[geodesy]], the exact shape that Earth's oceans would adopt in the absence of land and perturbations such as tides and winds is called the [[geoid]]. More precisely, the geoid is the surface of gravitational equipotential at [[mean sea level]].

[[Earth mass|Earth's mass]] is approximately {{val|5.97|e=24|ul=kg}} (5,970 [[yottagram|Yg]]). It is composed mostly of [[iron]] (32.1%), [[oxygen]] (30.1%), [[silicon]] (15.1%), [[magnesium]] (13.9%), [[sulfur]] (2.9%), [[nickel]] (1.8%), [[calcium]] (1.5%), and [[aluminium]] (1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to [[mass segregation]], the core region is estimated to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.&lt;ref name=pnas71_12_6973/&gt;

The most common rock constituents of the crust are nearly all [[oxide]]s: chlorine, sulfur, and fluorine are the important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1%. Over 99% of the crust is composed of 11 oxides, principally silica, alumina, iron oxides, lime, magnesia, potash and soda.&lt;ref name=brown_mussett1981/&gt;&lt;ref name=pnas71_12_6973/&gt;&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Petrology |volume=21 |page=328 |first=John Smith |last=Flett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal structure===
{{Main|Structure of the Earth}}
Earth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their [[chemical]] or physical ([[Rheology|rheological]]) properties. The outer layer is a chemically distinct [[Silicate minerals|silicate]] solid crust, which is underlain by a highly [[viscous]] solid mantle. The crust is separated from the mantle by the [[Mohorovičić discontinuity]]. The thickness of the crust varies from about {{convert|6|km|mi}} under the oceans to {{convert|30|-|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} for the continents. The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the [[upper mantle]] are collectively known as the lithosphere, and it is of the lithosphere that the tectonic plates are composed. Beneath the lithosphere is the [[asthenosphere]], a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides. Important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at {{convert|410|and|660|km|mi|abbr=on}} below the surface, spanning a [[Transition zone (Earth)|transition zone]] that separates the upper and lower mantle. Beneath the mantle, an extremely low viscosity liquid [[outer core]] lies above a solid [[inner core]].&lt;ref name=tanimoto_ahrens1995/&gt; The Earth's inner core might rotate at a slightly higher [[angular velocity]] than the remainder of the planet, advancing by 0.1–0.5° per year.&lt;ref name=science309_5739_1313/&gt; The radius of the inner core is about one fifth of that of Earth.

===Heat===
{{Main|Earth's internal heat budget}}
Earth's [[internal heat]] comes from a combination of residual heat from [[planetary accretion]] (about 20%) and heat produced through [[radioactive decay]] (80%).&lt;ref name="turcotte"/&gt; The major heat-producing [[isotope]]s within Earth are [[potassium-40]], [[uranium-238]], and [[thorium-232]].&lt;ref name=sanders20031210/&gt; At the center, the temperature may be up to {{convert|6000|C|F}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Earth's Centre is 1000 Degrees Hotter than Previously Thought |url=http://www.esrf.eu/news/general/Earth-Center-Hotter |website=The European Synchrotron (ESRF) |accessdate=12 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HKckNXMF?url=http://www.esrf.eu/news/general/Earth-Center-Hotter/Earth-Centre-Hotter |archivedate=12 June 2013 |date=25 April 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the pressure could reach {{convert|360|GPa|e6psi|abbr=unit|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name=ptrsl360_1795_1227/&gt; Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher. At approximately {{val|3|ul=Gyr}}, twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of [[mantle convection]] and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as [[komatiite]]s that are rarely formed today.&lt;ref name="turcotte" /&gt;&lt;ref name=epsl121_1/&gt;

{{Main|Plate tectonics}}
Earth's mechanically rigid outer layer, the lithosphere, is divided into tectonic plates. These plates are rigid segments that move relative to each other at one of three boundaries types: At [[Convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]], two plates come together; at [[Divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]], two plates are pulled apart; and at [[Transform boundary|transform boundaries]], two plates slide past one another laterally. Along these plate boundaries, [[earthquake]]s, [[Volcanism|volcanic activity]], [[Orogeny|mountain-building]], and [[oceanic trench]] formation can occur.&lt;ref name=kious_tilling1999/&gt; The tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.&lt;ref name=seligman2008/&gt;

[[File:Mount-Everest.jpg|thumb|left|[[Orogeny|Mountains build up]] when tectonic plates move toward each other, forcing rock up. The highest [[mountain]] on Earth above sea level is [[Mount Everest]].]]

As the tectonic plates migrate, oceanic crust is [[Subduction|subducted]] under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries. At the same time, the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries creates mid-ocean ridges. The combination of these processes recycles the [[oceanic crust]] back into the mantle. Due to this recycling, most of the ocean floor is less than {{val|100|u=Myr}} old. The oldest oceanic crust is located in the Western Pacific and is estimated to be {{val|200|u=Myr}} old.&lt;ref name=duennebier1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=noaa20070307/&gt; By comparison, the oldest dated [[continental crust]] is {{val|4030|u=Myr|fmt=commas}}.&lt;ref name=cmp134_3/&gt;

The seven major plates are the [[Pacific Plate|Pacific]], [[North American Plate|North American]], [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]], [[African Plate|African]], [[Antarctic Plate|Antarctic]], [[Indo-Australian Plate|Indo-Australian]], and [[South American Plate|South American]]. Other notable plates include the [[Arabian Plate]], the [[Caribbean Plate]], the [[Nazca Plate]] off the west coast of South America and the [[Scotia Plate]] in the southern Atlantic Ocean. The Australian Plate fused with the Indian Plate between {{val|50|and|55|u=Mya}}. The fastest-moving plates are the oceanic plates, with the [[Cocos Plate]] advancing at a rate of {{convert|75|mm/year|in/year|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name=podp2000/&gt; and the Pacific Plate moving {{convert|52|–|69|mm/year|in/year|abbr=on}}. At the other extreme, the slowest-moving plate is the Eurasian Plate, progressing at a typical rate of {{convert|21|mm/year|in/year|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=gps_time_series/&gt;

The abundance of water on Earth's surface is a unique feature that distinguishes the "Blue Planet" from other planets in the Solar System. Earth's hydrosphere consists chiefly of the oceans, but technically includes all water surfaces in the world, including inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters down to a depth of {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The deepest underwater location is [[Challenger Deep]] of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean with a depth of {{convert|10911.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref group="n" name="trench_depth"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaiko7000/&gt;

The mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35{{e|18}}&amp;nbsp;[[metric ton]]s or about 1/4400 of Earth's total mass. The oceans cover an area of {{convert|361.8|e6km2|e6mi2|abbr=unit}} with a mean depth of {{convert|3682|m|ft|abbr=on}}, resulting in an estimated volume of {{convert|1.332|e9km3|e6cumi|abbr=unit}}.&lt;ref name=ocean23_2_112/&gt; If all of Earth's crustal surface were at the same elevation as a smooth sphere, the depth of the resulting world ocean would be {{convert|2.7|to|2.8|km|mi|2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/559627/sphere-depth-of-the-ocean |title=sphere depth of the ocean&amp;nbsp;– hydrology |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ase.tufts.edu/cosmos/print_chapter.asp?id=4 |title=Third rock from the Sun&amp;nbsp;– restless Earth |work=NASA's Cosmos |accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 97.5% of the water is [[saline water|saline]]; the remaining 2.5% is [[fresh water]]. Most fresh water, about 68.7%, is present as ice in [[ice cap]]s and [[glacier]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://water.usgs.gov/edu/earthwherewater.html |title=The World's Water |last1=Perlman |first1=Howard |date=17 March 2014 |accessdate=12 April 2015 |work=USGS Water-Science School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average [[salinity]] of Earth's oceans is about 35&amp;nbsp;grams of salt per kilogram of sea water (3.5% salt).&lt;ref name=kennish2001/&gt; Most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks.&lt;ref name=mullen2002/&gt; The oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms.&lt;ref name=natsci_oxy4/&gt; Sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large [[heat reservoir]].&lt;ref name=michon2006/&gt; Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts, such as the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]].&lt;ref name=sample2005/&gt;

Earth's [[biosphere]] has significantly altered its [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]]. [[Oxygen evolution#Oxygen evolution in nature|Oxygenic photosynthesis]] evolved {{val|2.7|u=Gya}}, [[oxygen catastrophe|forming]] the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today.&lt;ref name="NYT-20131003" /&gt; This change enabled the proliferation of [[aerobic organisms]] and, indirectly, the formation of the [[ozone layer]] due to the subsequent [[Ozone–oxygen cycle|conversion of atmospheric {{chem2|O2}} into {{chem2|O3}}]]. The ozone layer blocks [[ultraviolet]] [[solar radiation]], permitting life on land.&lt;ref name="Harrison 2002"/&gt; Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small [[meteor]]s to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature.&lt;ref name="atmosphere"/&gt; This last phenomenon is known as the [[greenhouse effect]]: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture [[thermal energy]] emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, [[methane]], [[nitrous oxide]], and [[ozone]] are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be {{convert|−18|C|F}}, in contrast to the current {{convert|+15|C|F}},&lt;ref name="Pidwirny2006_7" /&gt; and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form.&lt;ref name=Narottam2008/&gt; In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be [[Reflection (physics)|reflected light]] from [[ice crystals]] in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="NYT-20170519"&gt;{{cite news |last=St. Fleur |first=Nicholas |title=Spotting Mysterious Twinkles on Earth From a Million Miles Away |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/science/dscovr-satellite-ice-glints-earth-atmosphere.html |date=19 May 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GRL-201760515"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marshak |first1=Alexander |last2=Várnai |first2=Tamás |last3=Kostinski |first3=Alexander |title=Terrestrial glint seen from deep space: oriented ice crystals detected from the Lagrangian point |date=15 May 2017 |journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]] |doi=10.1002/2017GL073248 |volume=44 |issue=10 |pages=5197–5202 |bibcode=2017GeoRL..44.5197M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, slowly becoming thinner and fading into outer space. Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the surface. This lowest layer is called the troposphere. Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air. The result is [[atmospheric circulation]] that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy.&lt;ref name="moran2005"/&gt;

The primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the [[trade winds]] in the equatorial region below 30° latitude and the [[westerlies]] in the mid-latitudes between 30° and 60°.&lt;ref name="berger2002"/&gt; [[Ocean current]]s are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the [[thermohaline circulation]] that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.&lt;ref name=rahmstorf2003/&gt;

Water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation.&lt;ref name="moran2005" /&gt; Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This [[water cycle]] is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.&lt;ref name=hydrologic_cycle/&gt;

The amount of solar energy reaching Earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude. At higher latitudes, the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles, and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere. As a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about {{convert|0.4|C-change|F-change|1}} per degree of latitude from the equator.&lt;ref name=sadava_heller2006/&gt; Earth's surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate. Ranging from the equator to the polar regions, these are the [[Tropics|tropical]] (or equatorial), [[Subtropics|subtropical]], [[temperate]] and [[Polar region|polar]] climates.&lt;ref name=climate_zones/&gt;

This latitudinal rule has several anomalies:
* Proximity to oceans moderates the climate. For example, the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]] has more moderate climate than similarly northern latitudes of [[northern Canada]].
* The [[wind]] enables this moderating effect. The windward side of a land mass experiences more moderation than the leeward side. In the Northern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is west-to-east, and western coasts tend to be milder than eastern coasts. This is seen in Eastern North America and Western Europe, where rough continental climates appear on the east coast on parallels with mild climates on the other side of the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livescience.com/13573-east-coast-colder-europe-west-coast.html |title=Why U.S. East Coast is colder than Europe's West Coast |publisher=Live Science |date=5 April 2011 |accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Southern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is east-to-west, and the eastern coasts are milder.
* The distance from the Earth to the Sun varies. The Earth is closest to the Sun (at [[perihelion]]) in January, which is summer in the Southern Hemisphere. It is furthest away (at [[aphelion]]) in July, which is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, and only 93.55% of the solar radiation from the Sun falls on a given square area of land than at perihelion. Despite this, there are larger land masses in the Northern Hemisphere, which are easier to heat than the seas. Consequently, summers are {{convert|2.3|C-change|F-change|0}} warmer in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere under similar conditions.&lt;ref name="Earth at Aphelion"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceweather.com/glossary/aphelion.html |title=Earth at Aphelion |publisher=Space Weather |date=July 2008 |accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The climate is colder at high altitudes than at sea level because of the decreased air density.

The commonly used [[Köppen climate classification]] system has five broad groups ([[tropical climate|humid tropics]], [[arid]], [[humid subtropical climate|humid middle latitudes]], [[Continental climate|continental]] and cold [[polar climate|polar]]), which are further divided into more specific subtypes.&lt;ref name="berger2002" /&gt; The Köppen system rates regions of terrain based on observed temperature and precipitation.

The highest air temperature ever measured on Earth was {{convert|56.7|C|F}} in [[Furnace Creek, California]], in [[Death Valley National Park|Death Valley]], in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/highest-recorded-temperature/ |title=Highest recorded temperature |publisher=Guinness World Records |accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest air temperature ever directly measured on Earth was {{convert|-89.2|C|F}} at [[Vostok Station]] in 1983,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lyons |first1=Walter A |title=The Handy Weather Answer Book |date=1997 |publisher=Visible Ink Press |location=Detroit, Michigan |isbn=978-0-7876-1034-0 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; but satellites have used remote sensing to measure temperatures as low as {{convert|-94.7|C|F}} in [[East Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/coldest-temperature-recorded-earth-antarctica-guinness-book |title=Coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth in Antarctica |journal=The Guardian |date=10 December 2013 |accessdate=12 July 2015|publisher=Associated Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; These temperature records are only measurements made with modern instruments from the 20th century onwards and likely do not reflect the full range of temperature on Earth.

====Upper atmosphere====
[[File:Full moon partially obscured by atmosphere.jpg|thumb|This view from orbit shows the [[full moon]] partially obscured by Earth's atmosphere.]]
Above the troposphere, the atmosphere is usually divided into the [[stratosphere]], [[mesosphere]], and [[thermosphere]].&lt;ref name="atmosphere" /&gt; Each layer has a different [[lapse rate]], defining the rate of change in temperature with height. Beyond these, the [[exosphere]] thins out into the [[magnetosphere]], where the geomagnetic fields interact with the [[solar wind]].&lt;ref name=sciweek2004/&gt; Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The [[Kármán line]], defined as 100&amp;nbsp;km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and [[outer space]].&lt;ref name=cordoba2004/&gt;

Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady [[Atmospheric escape|loss of the atmosphere into space]]. Because unfixed [[hydrogen]] has a low [[molecular mass]], it can achieve [[escape velocity]] more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases.&lt;ref name=jas31_4_1118/&gt; The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially [[redox|reducing]] state to its current [[Redox|oxidizing]] one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=sci293_5531_839/&gt; Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth.&lt;ref name=abedon1997/&gt; In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.&lt;ref name=arwps4_265/&gt;

The [[gravity of Earth]] is the [[acceleration]] that is imparted to objects due to the distribution of mass within the Earth. Near the Earth's surface, [[gravitational acceleration]] is approximately {{convert|9.8|m/s2|abbr=on}}. Local differences in [[topography]], [[geology]], and deeper tectonic structure cause local and broad, regional differences in the Earth's gravitational field, known as [[Gravity anomaly|gravity anomalies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=A.

===Magnetic field===
{{Main|Earth's magnetic field}}

The main part of [[Earth's magnetic field]] is generated in the core, the site of a [[Dynamo theory|dynamo]] process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy. The field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to Earth's surface, where it is, approximately, a [[dipole]]. The poles of the dipole are located close to Earth's geographic poles. At the equator of the magnetic field, the magnetic-field strength at the surface is {{nowrap|3.05 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; [[Tesla (unit)|T]]}}, with global [[magnetic dipole moment]] of {{nowrap|7.91 × 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; T m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=lang2003/&gt; The convection movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment. This causes [[Geomagnetic secular variation|secular variation]] of the main field and [[geomagnetic reversal|field reversals]] at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years. The most recent reversal occurred approximately 700,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=fitzpatrick2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=campbelwh/&gt;

The extent of Earth's magnetic field in space defines the [[magnetosphere]]. Ions and electrons of the solar wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; Because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bowshock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/jump.cfm?oid=40994 |title=Cluster reveals the reformation of the Earth's bow shock |publisher=European Space Agency |first=Arnaud |last=Masson |date=11 May 2007 |accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charged particle]]s are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plasmasphere.nasa.gov/ |title=The Earth's Plasmasphere |publisher=NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center |last=Gallagher |first=Dennis L. |date=14 August 2015 |accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plasmasphere.nasa.gov/formed.html |title=How the Plasmasphere is Formed |publisher=NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center |last=Gallagher |first=Dennis L. |date=27 May 2015 |accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field,&lt;ref name="BaumjohannTreumann1997"&gt;{{cite book |title=Basic Space Plasma Physics |publisher=World Scientific |first1=Wolfgang |last1=Baumjohann |first2=Rudolf A. |last2=Treumann |pages=8, 31 |year=1997 |isbn=978-1-86094-079-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Van Allen radiation belt]] are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/ionosphere-and-magnetosphere/Magnetosphere |title=Ionosphere and magnetosphere |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |first=Michael B. |last=McElroy |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Van Allen"&gt;{{cite book |title=Origins of Magnetospheric Physics |publisher=University of Iowa Press |last=Van Allen |first=James Alfred |date=2004 |isbn=978-0-87745-921-7 |oclc=646887856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[magnetic storm]]s and [[substorm]]s, charged particles can be deflected from the outer magnetosphere and especially the magnetotail, directed along field lines into Earth's ionosphere, where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized, causing the [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]].&lt;ref name=stern2005/&gt;

This construction is ambiguous--&gt;.&lt;ref name=USNO_TSD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rapid Service/Prediction of Earth Orientation |journal=IERS Bulletin-A |date=9 April 2015 |volume=28 |issue=15 |url=http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/ser7.dat |accessdate=12 April 2015 |format=.DAT file (displays as plaintext in browser)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth's rotation period relative to the [[fixed star]]s, called its ''stellar day'' by the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] (IERS), is {{nowrap|86,164.0989 seconds}} of mean solar time (UT1), or {{nowrap |23{{smallsup|h}} 56{{smallsup|m}} 4.0989{{smallsup|s}}.}}&lt;ref name=IERS/&gt;&lt;ref group="n" name="Aoki"/&gt; Earth's rotation period relative to the [[precession (astronomy)|precessing]] or moving mean [[vernal equinox]], misnamed its ''[[sidereal day]]'', is {{nowrap|86,164.0905 seconds}} of mean solar time (UT1) {{nowrap|(23{{smallsup|h}} 56{{smallsup|m}} 4.0905{{smallsup|s}})}}.&lt;ref name=IERS/&gt; Thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4&amp;nbsp;ms.&lt;ref name=seidelmann1992/&gt; The length of the mean solar day in SI seconds is available from the IERS for the periods 1623–2005&lt;ref name=iers1623/&gt; and 1962–2005.&lt;ref name=iers1962/&gt;

Apart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west at a rate of 15°/h = 15'/min. For bodies near the [[celestial equator]], this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.&lt;ref name=zeilik1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=angular/&gt;

===Orbit===
{{Main|Earth's orbit}}
[[File:Pale Blue Dot.png|thumb|upright|The ''[[Pale Blue Dot]]'' photo taken in 1990 by the ''[[Voyager 1]]'' spacecraft showing Earth (center right) from nearly {{convert|4|e9mi|e9km|order=flip|abbr=unit}} away]]

Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about {{convert|150|e6km|e6mi|abbr=unit}} every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one [[sidereal year]]. This gives an apparent movement of the Sun eastward with respect to the stars at a rate of about 1°/day, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12&amp;nbsp;hours. Due to this motion, on average it takes 24&amp;nbsp;hours—a [[Solar time|solar day]]—for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the [[Meridian (astronomy)|meridian]]. The orbital speed of Earth averages about {{convert|29.78|km/s|km/h mph|abbr=on}}, which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to Earth's diameter, about {{convert|12742|km|mi|abbr=on}}, in seven minutes, and the distance to the Moon, {{convert|384000|km|mi|abbr=on}}, in about 3.5 hours.&lt;ref name="earth_fact_sheet" /&gt;

The Moon and Earth orbit a common [[barycenter]] every 27.32&amp;nbsp;days relative to the background stars. When combined with the Earth–Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, the period of the [[synodic month]], from new moon to new moon, is 29.53&amp;nbsp;days. Viewed from the [[celestial pole|celestial north pole]], the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all [[counterclockwise]]. Viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and Earth, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's [[axial tilt|axis is tilted]] some 23.44&amp;nbsp;degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth–Sun plane (the [[ecliptic]]), and the Earth–Moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1&amp;nbsp;degrees against the Earth–Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between [[lunar eclipse]]s and [[solar eclipse]]s.&lt;ref name="earth_fact_sheet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moon_fact_sheet" /&gt;

The [[Hill sphere]], or the sphere of [[Gravity|gravitational]] influence, of the Earth is about {{convert|1.5|e6km|mi|abbr=unit}} in radius.&lt;ref name=vazquez_etal2006 /&gt;&lt;ref group="n" name="hill_radius" /&gt; This is the maximum distance at which the Earth's gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant Sun and planets. Objects must orbit the Earth within this radius, or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun.

Earth, along with the Solar System, is situated in the [[Milky Way]] and orbits about 28,000&amp;nbsp;[[light-year]]s from its center. It is about 20&amp;nbsp;light-years above the [[galactic plane]] in the [[Orion Arm]].&lt;ref name=nasa20051201 /&gt;

===Axial tilt and seasons===
{{Main|Axial tilt#Earth}}
[[File:AxialTiltObliquity.png|thumb|left|Earth's axial tilt (or [[obliquity]]) and its relation to the [[Rotation|rotation axis]] and [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|plane of orbit]]]]
The axial tilt of the Earth is approximately 23.439281°&lt;ref name="IERS"/&gt; with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the [[Celestial Poles]]. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with [[summer]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] occurring when the [[Tropic of Cancer]] is facing the Sun, and [[winter]] taking place when the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] faces the Sun. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter. In northern temperate latitudes, the Sun rises north of true east during the summer solstice, and sets north of true west, reversing in the winter. The Sun rises south of true east in the summer for the southern temperate zone and sets south of true west.

Above the [[Arctic Circle]], an extreme case is reached where there is no daylight at all for part of the year, up to six months at the North Pole itself, a [[polar night]]. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is exactly reversed, with the [[South Pole]] oriented opposite the direction of the North Pole. Six months later, this pole will experience a [[midnight sun]], a day of 24 hours, again reversing with the South Pole.

By astronomical convention, the four seasons can be determined by the [[solstice]]s—the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun—and the [[equinox]]es, when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the Sun are perpendicular. In the Northern Hemisphere, [[winter solstice]] currently occurs around 21 December; [[summer solstice]] is near 21 June, [[spring equinox]] is around 20 March and [[autumnal equinox]] is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.&lt;ref name=bromberg2008/&gt;

The angle of Earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time. Its axial tilt does undergo [[nutation]]; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=lin2006/&gt; The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, [[precession|precessing]] around in a complete circle over each 25,800&amp;nbsp;year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a [[tropical year]]. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface. This [[polar motion]] has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed [[quasiperiodic motion]]. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the [[Chandler wobble]]. Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.&lt;ref name=fisher19960205/&gt;

In modern times, Earth's [[perihelion]] occurs around 3 January, and its [[aphelion]] around 4 July. These dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as [[Milankovitch cycles]]. The changing Earth–Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.9%&lt;ref group="n" name="solar_energy"/&gt; in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;ref name=williams20051230/&gt;

A study from 2016 suggested that [[Planet Nine]] tilted all [[Solar System]] planets, including Earth's, by about six degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.space.com/34448-planet-nine-solar-system-tilt.html |title=Did the Mysterious 'Planet Nine' Tilt the Solar System? |work=Space.com |first=Charles Q. |last=Choi |date=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitability==
[[File:Moraine Lake 17092005.jpg|thumb|The [[Rocky Mountains]] in Canada overlook [[Moraine Lake]].]]
A planet that can sustain life is termed [[Planetary habitability|habitable]], even if life did not originate there. Earth provides liquid water—an environment where complex [[Organic compound|organic molecules]] can assemble and interact, and sufficient energy to sustain [[metabolism]].&lt;ref name=ab2003/&gt; The distance of Earth from the Sun, as well as its orbital eccentricity, rate of rotation, axial tilt, geological history, sustaining atmosphere, and magnetic field all contribute to the current climatic conditions at the surface.&lt;ref name=dole1970/&gt;

===Biosphere===
{{Main|Biosphere}}
A planet's life forms inhabit [[ecosystem]]s, whose total is sometimes said to form a "biosphere". Earth's biosphere is thought to have begun [[evolution|evolving]] about {{val|3.5|u=Gya}}.&lt;ref name="NYT-20131003" /&gt; The biosphere is divided into a number of [[biome]]s, inhabited by broadly similar plants and animals. On land, biomes are separated primarily by differences in latitude, [[elevation|height above sea level]] and [[humidity]]. Terrestrial [[tundra|biomes]] lying within the Arctic or [[Antarctic Circle]]s, at [[Alpine tundra|high altitudes]] or in [[desert|extremely arid areas]] are relatively barren of plant and animal life; [[Latitudinal gradients in species diversity|species diversity]] reaches a peak in [[tropical rainforest|humid lowlands at equatorial latitudes]].&lt;ref name=amnat163_2_192/&gt;

In July 2016, scientists reported identifying a set of 355 [[gene]]s from the [[last universal common ancestor]] (LUCA) of all [[organism]]s living on Earth.&lt;ref name="NYT-20160725"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wade |first=Nicholas |authorlink=Nicholas Wade |title=Meet Luca, the Ancestor of All Living Things |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/26/science/last-universal-ancestor.html |date=25 July 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth has resources that have been exploited by humans. Those termed [[non-renewable resource]]s, such as [[fossil fuel]]s, only renew over geological timescales.

Large deposits of fossil fuels are obtained from Earth's crust, consisting of [[coal]], [[petroleum]], and [[natural gas]]. These deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production. Mineral [[ore]] bodies have also been formed within the crust through a process of [[ore genesis]], resulting from actions of [[magmatism]], erosion, and plate tectonics.&lt;ref name="Ramdohr"/&gt; These bodies form concentrated sources for many metals and other useful [[chemical element|elements]].

Earth's biosphere produces many useful biological products for humans, including food, [[wood]], [[pharmaceutical]]s, oxygen, and the recycling of many organic wastes. The land-based [[ecosystem]] depends upon [[topsoil]] and fresh water, and the oceanic ecosystem depends upon dissolved nutrients washed down from the land.&lt;ref name=science299_5607_673/&gt; In 1980, {{convert|5053|e6ha|e6km2 e6sqmi|order=out|abbr=unit}} of Earth's land surface consisted of forest and woodlands, {{convert|6788|e6ha|e6km2 e6sqmi|order=out|abbr=unit}} was grasslands and pasture, and {{convert|1501|e6ha|e6km2 e6sqmi|order=out|abbr=unit}} was cultivated as croplands.&lt;ref name="Turner1990"/&gt; The estimated amount of [[irrigated land]] in 1993 was {{convert|2481250|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; Humans also live on the land by using [[building material]]s to construct shelters.

===Natural and environmental hazards===
[[File:Pavlof2014iss.jpg|thumb|left|A volcano injecting hot ash into the atmosphere]]
Large areas of Earth's surface are subject to extreme weather such as tropical [[cyclone]]s, [[hurricane]]s, or [[typhoon]]s that dominate life in those areas. From 1980 to 2000, these events caused an average of 11,800 human deaths per year.&lt;ref name=walsh2008/&gt; Many places are subject to earthquakes, [[landslide]]s, [[tsunami]]s, [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruptions]], [[tornado]]es, [[sinkhole]]s, [[blizzard]]s, floods, droughts, [[wildfire]]s, and other calamities and disasters.

Many localized areas are subject to human-made [[pollution]] of the air and water, [[acid rain]] and toxic substances, loss of vegetation ([[overgrazing]], [[deforestation]], [[desertification]]), loss of wildlife, species [[extinction]], [[soil degradation]], [[soil depletion]] and [[erosion]].

There is a [[scientific consensus]] linking human activities to [[global warming]] due to industrial carbon dioxide emissions. This is predicted to produce changes such as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, more extreme temperature ranges, significant changes in weather and a [[Sea level rise|global rise in average sea levels]].&lt;ref name=un20070202/&gt;

[[Cartography]], the study and practice of map-making, and [[geography]], the study of the lands, features, inhabitants and phenomena on Earth, have historically been the disciplines devoted to depicting Earth.

{{Main|Moon}}

The Moon is a relatively large, [[Terrestrial planet|terrestrial]], planet-like [[natural satellite]], with a diameter about one-quarter of Earth's. It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, although [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] is larger relative to the [[dwarf planet]] [[Pluto]]. The natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as "moons", after Earth's.

The gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon causes [[tide]]s on Earth. The same effect on the Moon has led to its [[tidal locking]]: its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the [[lunar phase]]s; the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the [[terminator (solar)|solar terminator]].
[[File:Earth-Moon.svg|thumb|left|Details of the Earth–Moon system, showing the radius of each object and the Earth–Moon [[barycenter]]. The Moon's axis is located by [[Cassini's laws|Cassini's third law]].]]

Due to their [[Tidal acceleration|tidal interaction]], the Moon recedes from Earth at the rate of approximately {{convert|38|mm/yr|in/yr|abbr=on}}. Over millions of years, these tiny modifications—and the lengthening of Earth's day by about 23&amp;nbsp;[[Microsecond|µs]]/yr—add up to significant changes.&lt;ref name=espenak_meeus20070207/&gt; During the [[Devonian]] period, for example, (approximately {{val|410|u=Mya}}) there were 400 days in a year, with each day lasting 21.8 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lambeck |first=Kurt |title=The Earth's Variable Rotation: Geophysical Causes and Consequences |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1980 |page=367 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-kiG3uYkoUEC&amp;pg=PA62 |isbn=978-0-521-67330-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet's climate. [[Paleontology|Paleontological]] evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon.&lt;ref name=aaa428_261/&gt; Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the [[torque]]s applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting chaotic changes over millions of years, as appears to be the case for Mars.&lt;ref name=nature410_6830_773/&gt;

Viewed from Earth, the Moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The [[angular size]] (or [[solid angle]]) of these two bodies match because, although the Sun's diameter is about 400 times as large as the Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant.&lt;ref name=angular /&gt; This allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth.

The most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the [[giant-impact hypothesis]], states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains (among other things) the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's crust.&lt;ref name=nature412_708/&gt;

Scientific investigation has resulted in several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet.

[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] used [[thermodynamics]] to estimate the age of Earth to be between 20 million and 400&amp;nbsp;million years in 1864, sparking a vigorous debate on the subject; it was only when radioactivity and [[Radiometric dating|radioactive dating]] were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining Earth's age was established, proving the planet to be billions of years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=An Equation for Every Occasion: Fifty-Two Formulas and Why They Matter |last=Henshaw |first=John M. |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-421-41491-1 |location= |pages=117–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Lord Kelvin and the Age of the Earth |last=Burchfield |first=Joe D. |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-226-08043-7 |location= |pages=13–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perception of Earth shifted again in the 20th century when humans first viewed it from orbit, and especially with photographs of Earth returned by the [[Apollo program]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20181221"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Apollo 8’s Earthrise: The Shot Seen Round the World - Half a century ago today, a photograph from the moon helped humans rediscover Earth. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/science/earthrise-moon-apollo-nasa.html |date=December 21, 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=December 24, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20181224a"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Boulton |first1=Matthew Myer |last2=Heithaus |first2=Joseph |title=We Are All Riders on the Same Planet - Seen from space 50 years ago, Earth appeared as a gift to preserve and cherish.

&lt;ref name=Aoki&gt;The ultimate source of these figures, uses the term "seconds of UT1" instead of "seconds of mean solar time".—{{cite journal |last=Aoki |first=S. |title=The new definition of universal time |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |year=1982 |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=359–61 |bibcode=1982A&amp;A...105..359A |last2=Kinoshita |first2=H. |last3=Guinot |first3=B. |last4=Kaplan |first4=G.

&lt;ref name=apsis&gt;aphelion = ''a'' × (1 + ''e''); perihelion = ''a'' × (1&amp;nbsp;– ''e''), where ''a'' is the semi-major axis and ''e'' is the eccentricity. The difference between Earth's perihelion and aphelion is 5 million kilometers.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=epoch&gt;All astronomical quantities vary, both [[Secular phenomena|secularly]] and [[Frequency|periodically]]. The quantities given are the values at the instant [[J2000.0]] of the secular variation, ignoring all periodic variations.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=hill_radius&gt;For Earth, the [[Hill radius]] is &lt;math&gt;R_H = a\left ( \frac{m}{3M} \right )^{\frac{1}{3}}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''m'' is the mass of Earth, ''a'' is an astronomical unit, and ''M'' is the mass of the Sun. So the radius in AU is about &lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac{1}{3 \cdot 332,946} \right )^{\frac{1}{3}} = 0.01&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=jaes41_3_379&gt;Including the [[Somali Plate]], which is being formed out of the African Plate. See: {{cite journal |first=Jean |last=Chorowicz |date=October 2005 |title=The East African rift system |journal=[[Journal of African Earth Sciences]] |volume=43 |issue=1–3 |pages=379–410 |doi=10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2005.07.019 |bibcode=2005JAfES..43..379C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=sidereal_solar&gt;The number of solar days in a year is one less than the number of [[sidereal day]]s (the time it takes the Earth to revolve exactly 360 degrees around its axis) because a solar day is about 236 seconds longer than a sidereal day. Over a year, this discrepancy adds up to a full sidereal day.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=solar_energy&gt;Aphelion is 103.4% of the distance to perihelion. Due to the inverse square law, the radiation at perihelion is about 106.9% the energy at aphelion.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=surfacecover&gt;Due to natural fluctuations, ambiguities surrounding [[Ice shelf|ice shelves]], and mapping conventions for [[vertical datum]]s, exact values for land and ocean coverage are not meaningful. Based on data from the [[Vector Map]] and [http://www.landcover.org/ Global Landcover] datasets, extreme values for coverage of lakes and streams are 0.6% and 1.0% of Earth's surface. The ice shields of [[Antarctica]] and [[Greenland]] are counted as land, even though much of the rock that supports them lies below sea level.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=trench_depth&gt;This is the measurement taken by the vessel ''[[Kaikō]]'' in March 1995 and is considered the most accurate measurement to date. See the [[Challenger Deep]] article for more details.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Selvaggio Blu''' (Wild Blue) is a [[Hiking|trekking]] route in the territory of the district of [[Baunei]] ([[Sardinia]]). It was conceived in 1987 by '''Mario Verin''', (photographer and alpinist) and '''Peppino Cicalò''' (architect), President of the [[Nuoro]] section of the [[Italian Alpine Club]]. The itinerary extends for over 40 kilometers (approximately 25 miles) from the touristic port of [[Santa Maria Navarrese]] (Baunei) to the beach of Cala Sisine (Baunei).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It takes on average 4 days to complete.

The Selvaggio Blu is considered one of the last wild trekking routes of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] because, for the major part of the itinerary, it can only be accessed by boat or by following the path along the coast of the Gulf of Orosei.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/4665796e-666b-11e4-8bf6-00144feabdc0|title=The wild Blue trek of coastal Sardinia|last=Carter|first=Mike|date=2014-11-14|work=Financial Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Verin and Cicalò used the name 'Selvaggio Blu' to reflect the main characteristics of the journey: "Selvaggio" to reflect the wildness and pureness of the experience, and "Blu" because the trek goes along the coast, where the color of the sea and the sky is predominant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Location ==
The Selvaggio Blu is located entirely in the territory of the district of Baunei which extends for 211.9 km2 on the east coast of Sardinia, in the province of [[Province of Ogliastra|Ogliastra]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Baunei area is considered one of the wildest in Sardinia, going from the coastal town of Santa Maria Navarrese and traversing [[Limestone]] plateaux and coastal scenery to the beach of Cala Luna. It contains all the main centers on the route, including: Santa Maria Navarrese, Pedra Longa, Portu Pedrosu, [[Cala Goloritzé|Cala Goloritzè]], Su Feilau, Cala Sisine and also all the centers included in Selvaggio Blu variations: Cala Mariolu, Cala Biriala; S'Istrada Longa, Grotta del Fico and the plateau of Golgo.

== Geology ==
[[File:Selvaggio Blu´s cliff coast.jpg|left|thumb|293x293px|The cliffed coast of the Gulf of Orosei]]
Selvaggio Blu has a strategic location to see the geological history of Sardinia, as it is located 40&amp;nbsp;km along the coast. There are several important geology observations on Selvaggio Blu's hiking route which can be reached both by land and sea.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the northern part of '''Santa Maria Navarrese''', hikers have the possibility to move along a section with fractured [[granite]] from the [[Paleozoic|Palazoic]] age, where rocks are several meters thick. This area contains some of Sardinia's oldest rocks, covered with layers of Cambrian-Ordovician metasandstones, [[phyllite]]s and [[quartzite]]s. In '''Pedra Longa''' the section with granite ends, and there is a transition to the limestones, which are a common feature of the Gulf of Orosei coast. Because of [[climate change]]s the limestone has been affected by rising and falling of [[sea level]]. Changes caused by the mixing of fresh water from the limestone and salt sea water include larger limestones cavities and fluctuations in different colours.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Grotta del Fico''' is a [[karst]] [[cave]] located on the Selvaggio Blu between Santa Maria Navarrese and Cala Luna. Grotta del Fico is accessible by boat or walking. It was discovered by fishermen in the early 20th century, and opened to the public with guided tours in 2003. Inside Grotta del Fico there is a lake with clear water which reflects inside the cave. The lake is created by karst water that flows in the main part of the cave and fills up the lake.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Selvaggio Blu drawing.jpg|thumb|Drawing made by the alpine guide Marcello Cominetti about a passage of the Selvaggio Blu.|alt=]]

* '''1963:''' Peppino Cicalò conceived the initial route after some exploratory excursions. He completed the first part of the route, leaving from Fonni and passing through Punta la Marmora to Baunei. He also thought to go through the Supramonte northwards. After meeting Mario Verin, while studying in Florence, he developed the Selvaggio Blu, with the help of his partner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   
* '''1981:''' two expert climbers, [[Alessandro Gogna]] and [[Maurizio Zanolla]], opened the first climbing route in this area with their ascent of the Aguglia of Goloritzè, a limestone monolith on the sea cliffs. Their route traversed from Cala Luna to Baunei and is regarded as the original core of the Selvaggio Blu, although this name was not used until 1988.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   
* '''1985:''' an Italian national travel magazine, Airone, featured an article by Jacopo Merizzi about the trek, publicizing it to a wider audience.   
* '''1986:''' Peppino Cicalò proposed to the mayor of Baunei to connect together the already existing treks to create a new, single longer one. Mario Verin also became interested in the wild Supramonte at this period.
*'''May''' '''1987:''' Cicalò invited his friend Mario Verin to Santa Maria Navarrese to walk from Pedra Longa to Cala Sisine, by following the edge of the cliffs (an idea from their youth). In two days, the pair managed to get to Cala Goloritzè, naming their new trek "''Da guglia a guglia''". They had limited maps available, and dense [[Maquis shrubland|macchia Mediterranea]] to negotiate. They attempted to identify the easiest paths to make the route accessible to subsequent visitors, requiring them to choose between including a route along the cliffs, a source of danger for non-expert climbers, or to proceed in the less scenic macchia. After this, they decided to climb up via Boladina as a part of the Golgo exploration. At the end of this trip they decided to continue their exploration the following year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*'''May 1988:'''  Cicalò and Verin returned to Baunei and completed the continuation of the route to Cala Sisine, renaming it the "Selvaggio Blu". The travel magazine Alp (n° 38/1988) also published the initial part of the route, illustrated by a detailed set of photos. Dino Barranu, Baunei's mayor at this time, understood the potential importance of this initiative to local tourism, and initiated a project emulating [[Corsica]]'s trekking paths. The main purpose was to raise awareness of the region by recuperating old mule tracks, marking the track, and training local guides.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Trek ==
Selvaggio Blu is a 40 kilometers trek that has an estimated travel time of '''4 days''', but many people take about '''6 – 7 days''', depending on experience and fitness.

=== Day One ===
[[File:Selvaggioblu1.jpg|thumb|Day one: the peak of Pedra Longa and the coastal town of Santa Maria Navarrese.|279x279px]]
The Selvaggio Blu starts at Pedra Longa (40°1'38"N 9°42'25"E) and goes to Portu Pedrosu (40°4'5"N 9°44'2"E). It has an estimated travel time of 9 hours to cover its '''12&amp;nbsp;km''' of length. In this stage it is reached the maximum height of all the Selvaggio Blu, which is '''770 m'''. This section gets a climbing grade of '''EEA''' on the '''UAII''' Scale, which makes this stage the third hardest in technical difficulty of the entire journey.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The path crosses a small valley into the woods until it reaches a point where it is possible to see the sea. The path continues into another small valley with holm oaks, walking on very sharp limestone flakes. The path then crosses two gates, after which it descends toward the sea following the cliffs. Then, passing on the top of the '''Grotta dei Colombi''', the path once again entersa small valley. Descending this valley, on the left there is a section equipped with juniper trunks that allow climbers to descend into Bacu Tenadili. The path at this point challenges the orientation skills of the climbers because of the lack of a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] signal. After this section, there is a cracked limestone area where the shepherds are used to collecting water; after this the path becomes less clear. Following a steep zigzag, the path leads to the mooring of Portu Pedrosu were the first stage ends. Walking for 10 minutes more to Portu Cuau(40°5'11"N 9°43'55"E) there is a large space for camping&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Day Two ===
The itinerary of the second day starts at Portu Pedrosu and ends in Cala Goloritzè (40°6'29"N 9°41'23"E), the maximum height reached during this day is about '''495 m'''. This stage is '''9.5&amp;nbsp;km''' and the estimated travel time is of 6 hours. It is not as difficult as the other paths; its difficulty has been ranked as '''EE''' on the UAII scale, which makes this the easiest technical section of the Selvaggio Blu.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; From Portu Pedrosu the path is well defined for a short section due to a good muletrack surrounded by vegetation. Passing a small valley, the path climbs up to a rocky plateau where  the track becomes less well defined. Making a large curve towards the North, which is partially covered by the vegetation, the path follows the edge of a small valley, continuing until it reaches a balcony overlooking the sea (2&amp;nbsp;km from Portu Cuau). Keeping the sea behind, the path proceeds through small rocks and [[Quercus ilex|holm oak]] sections, until it reaches the ovile of Kenos Trainos, one of the most important along the Selvaggio Blu. From this point, the path becomes less clear because of thick vegetation and a small rocky step. Reaching Su Runcu'e su Press it is possible to escape from the Selvaggio Blu and in 15 minutes reach a clearing which is accessible by a [[Sport utility vehicle|Suv]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  [[File:Abseil of Selvaggio Blu.jpg|thumb|One of the two abseils encountered during the itinerary of the Selvaggio Blu's third day|alt=|260x260px]]

=== Day Three ===
The itinerary of the third day is '''7.4&amp;nbsp;km''' long, with a maximum height of '''485 m'''.  It is the most difficult stage of the whole route; its difficulty has been ranked '''IV+''' of the UIAA scale. Some people decide to stop during this stage because of all the obstacles on the path to Bacu Su Feilau. This section requires the capability to travel on all types of terrain, with difficulties including the exposure, difficult vegetation, and the lack of GPS signal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The book of Selvaggio Blu|last=Vernin|first=Mario|last2=Castelli|first2=Giulia|publisher=Edizioni Enrico Spanu|year=2013|isbn=9788898309047|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this stage, which starts from Cala Golorizè and ends in Bacu su Feilau (40°3'59"N 9°34'52"E), the itinerary climbs two rock walls, the first one of 20 meters and the second one of 4 meters. These represent the hardest technical climbing difficulties on the Selvaggio Blu. This section includes several caves and woods, and 2 abseils of 20 meters each. Bacu su Feliau, which is a big hole through the rocky spur that overlooks Bacu Padente, was originally a [[Bivouac shelter]] on Selvaggio Blu, but for large groups it is recommended to descend it and climb up towards '''Ololbizz'''i, a [[charcoal]] burners' circle in the upper part of the Bacu.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Day Four ===
The last day starts from Bacu Su Feliau and ends '''7&amp;nbsp;km''' later in Cala Sisine(40°10'45"N 9°38'1"E). It offers a large variety of scenery, the highest altitude reached during this stage is '''480 m'''. The estimated travel time is  6.5 hours and the technical difficulty is ranked '''IV''' on the '''UIAA scale'''.  This makes this stage the second most difficult of the Selvaggio Blu.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; At the start of this stage, it is necessary to climb a juniper trunk with giant moss-covered [[oak]]s. The route then traverses a [[gully]] and is then marked with blue waymarks painted on rocks. These mark the way to exit the woods, utilizing ancient mule tracks, and gives a panoramic view of the sea. Before descending, there is the possibility to climb a cliff named "'''rottura delle altezze'''" (which means "'''breaking the heights'''") from which walkers can look at the sea 200 m below. One of the paths leads to the ovule '''Piddi''', meaning [[Mandragora officinarum|Mandragora]] or Mandrake in [[Sardinian language|Sards]]; this poisonous plant grows all over the Supramonte. Helped by the locals, Verin and Cicalò built a network of mule tracks that, with a series of bends, pass through the most impervious gullies and lead to the sea, which can be seen only in Cala Sisine; here there are docks built to transport charcoal and woods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  From Cala Sisine it is possible to return to the starting point by the  sea with an inflatable boat or by land with a SUV.

== Variations of Selvaggio Blu==

[[File:Selvaggioblu9.jpg|left|thumb|293x293px|The beach of Cala Mariolu, a variation of the Selvaggio Blu]]There are several different versions of the Selvaggio Blu:

* The first is the original one conceived in 1987 by Mario Verin and Peppino Cicalò that goes from Pedra Longa to Cala Sisine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The second one is called '''Selvaggio Blu+Blu''' (Wild Blue+Blue) conceived by the Alpine Guide ''Marcello Cominetti'' together with ''Explorando Supramonte'' in 2014. It lasts 7 days and has different variations compared to the original trek: there is a stop at Grotta del Fico and at the beaches of Cala Mariolu and Cala Biriala and a passage through Cala Goloritzè.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* The third one is called '''Blu Selvaggio''' (Blue Wild) and is considered the hardest one. It goes from North to South, in the opposite direction of the original trek, and includes passages not covered in the original one like ''S'istrada Longa, Ferrata di Plummare'' and ''Plummar'e Mudaloru.'';&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fringeintravel.com/selvaggio-blu-mini-guida-per-il-trekking-piu-difficile-ditalia/|title=Selvaggio Blu: mini guida per il trekking più difficile d’Italia|last=Lascialfari|first=Marco|date=2018-02-01|work=Fringe In Travel|access-date=2018-10-06|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* The fourth one is called '''Light Selvaggio''' because it is easier as it does not incorporate any climbing or rappels, so does not require a high level of competence in [[hiking]] and [[abseiling]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

There are other variations of the Selvaggio Blu as '''''daily excursions''''':

* '''Cala Biriala:''' it takes about 1 hour drive and 3 hours walk (3&amp;nbsp;km) and it's a trek for skilled hikers (EE). It offers a complete  view of the coast of Baunei.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* '''Cala Mariolu''': also called from locals ''"Ispuligedenie"'' because when they first discovered the beach they thought that the sand was like snowflakes. The trek starts from the plateau of Golgo (Baunei) and goes for 6&amp;nbsp;km long, about 3 hours. There are a steep hill and arches of rocks, therefore, the hike can be done only by skilled hikers (EE).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.montagnapertutti.it/pag_info/difficolta_en.html|title=Grade Systems for Mountain Activities|last=Gozzi|first=Carlo|date=|website=La Montagna per tutti|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Cala Goloritzè''': this beach is a [[Natural monument|Natural Monument]] from 1993, and is accessible only by swimming or walking. This trek starts from the plateau of Golgo and it takes 1 hour and 30 minutes (3.5&amp;nbsp;km) to reach the beach. The difficulty of this trek is not too extreme and can be done by hikers that have moderate skills (E).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* '''Cala Sisine:''' the trek for cala Sisine is considered one of the easiest because it takes a 1-hour drive and 45 minutes walking (2&amp;nbsp;km) along a dry river-bed. It can be done by everyone (T).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* '''Punta Giradili''': it is a 3 hours walk (7,5&amp;nbsp;km) with a 600 m elevation. This trek is for moderately skilled hikers (E).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* '''S'Istrada Longa''': it means ''" The Long Road"'' because it is a long hike that starts from the plateau of Margine (Baunei) to Cala Sisine (11&amp;nbsp;km). This trek is only for skilled hikers (EE).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Curiosities ==

* During the '''third stage''', near the first abseil, the route passes near some '''natural pools;''' here guides leave plastic containers to collect water that they can re-use for bivouacs. It is recommended not to rely only on these containers, as this water is dependent on rainfall. This place is characterized by [[Ficus|fig trees]] with long branches, rocks covered with green [[moss]] and insectivores like [[warbler]] that are attracted by the insect that can be found in humid places.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Selvaggio Blu was initially thought by the creators, as they discussed with the council of Baunei, to be a walk that could have been done by everyone; they wanted to avoid climbing and abseiling, adding [[Via ferrata|vie ferrate]] (that can be found in the [[alps]]) when it was unavoidable. This has not been done yet, but the itinerary has been made easier as some exposed sections had led to the fixing of ropes and chains even if it's not necessary; this compromise leaves the lack of way making (which is the major difficulty) untouched.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*It is possible to see '''Sardinian [[mouflon]]''' over the rocky steps of the itinerary of the last day. During the summer or hot days it is possible to see them in the late afternoon of the evening, while on cold days or in winter they can be seen during the day. They are well adapted to uneven ground of the mountains, because of their muscular body they can climb steep rock walls and they can run at 60&amp;nbsp;km/h. The male can weight 50&amp;nbsp;kg, while the female usually weights 25&amp;nbsp;kg; these mouflons are present in Sardinia since [[Neolithic]] times.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*Many mule tracks that could have been seen and used by trekkers have disappeared because they have been covered by dense vegetation.
*The paint of the blue waymarking in the last part of the itinerary has been recently renewed by a walker, to help other trekkers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*Once a group walked the entire itinerary of Selvaggio Blu barefoot.
*A trekker, '''Nicola Bassi''', winner of the 90&amp;nbsp;km Ultratrek, finished the route in only 8 hours and 10 minutes, without any external help and without stopping by to sleep or rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.turismobaunei.eu/en/my-product/selvaggio-blu-nuovo-record-di-percorrenza/|title=Selvaggio Blu.

*'''Explorando Supramonte'''´s jeeps and [[raft]]s are available to go for self-guided hikes. There are combined excursions provided to the coast of Baunei where jeeps are available for transportations. '''Explorando Supramonte'''´s jeeps and rafts helps people with the planning and the organisation of customised hiking trips, they also help with logistics during self-guided Selvaggio Blu. During the hiking they provides help in transporting heavy luggage, mountain equipment and camping stuff between the different stages, they deliver also meals and are available for assistance during the hike.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*Some transport services are offered by local companies to support the trek. The walkers who tackle Selvaggio Blu can make arrangements to receive supplies every evening, so as to be able to walk with a lighter rucksack. The equipment is usually delivered in the evening and collected the following morning. After that, it is taken to the next spot. This service is available only when the sea is not rough; under these circumstances, it would not be possible by land.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
