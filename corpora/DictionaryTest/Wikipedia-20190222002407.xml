'''Infradian rhythm''' is, in [[chronobiology]] a rhythm with a duration longer than that of a [[circadian rhythm]], i.e. with a frequency less than one cycle in 28 hours,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Frederick M. &amp; Graeber, R. Curtis, eds.  The Rhythmic Aspects of Behavior. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. 1982, (p.462).&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[menstrual cycle]], breeding and tidal or seasonal rhythms. [[Ultradian rhythm]]s by contrast, have periods shorter than the period of a circadian rhythm. A number of infradian rhythms are known to be caused by hormone stimulation or exogenous factors for example [[seasonal depression]], linked to the lowering of light levels during [[winter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychteacher.co.uk/biologicalrhythms/infradian_ultradian_rhythms.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Microbial syntrophy ==
Syntrophy plays an important role in a large number of microbial processes.

The defining feature of&amp;nbsp;[[ruminant]]s, such as cows and goats, is a stomach called a&amp;nbsp;[[rumen]].&amp;nbsp;The rumen contains billions of microbes, many of which are syntrophic. One excellent example of this syntrophy is&amp;nbsp;[[interspecies hydrogen transfer]]. Some anaerobic fermenting microbes in the rumen (and other gastrointestinal tracts) are capable of degrading organic matter to short chain fatty acids, and hydrogen.&amp;nbsp;The accumulating hydrogen inhibits the microbe's ability to continue degrading organic matter, but syntrophic hydrogen-consuming microbes allow continued growth by metabolizing the waste products.&amp;nbsp;In addition, fermentative bacteria gain maximum energy yield when protons are used as electron acceptor with concurrent H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;production.&amp;nbsp;Hydrogen-consuming organisms include methanogens, sulfate-reducers, acetogens, and others.&amp;nbsp;Some fermentation products, such as fatty acids longer than two carbon atoms, alcohols longer than one carbon atom, and branched-chain and aromatic fatty acids, cannot directly be used in [[methanogenesis]]. In acetogenesis process, these products are oxidized to acetate and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;by obligated proton reducing bacteria in syntrophic relationship with methanogenic archaea as low H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;partial pressure is essential for acetogenic reactions to be thermodynamically favorable (ΔG &lt; 0).&amp;nbsp;(Stams et al., 2005)

The number of bacterial cells that live on or in the human body, for example throughout the alimentary canal and on the skin, is in the region of 10 times the total number of human cells in it.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/22/microbes-human-body-video_n_4536675.html Crazy Way Microbes Colonize, Control The Human Body] interview with Dr. Justin Sonnenburg, assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University School of Medicine&lt;/ref&gt; These microbes are [[Endosymbiont|vital]], for instance for the digestive and the immune system to function.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;[http://microbiologyonline.org.uk/about-microbiology/microbes-and-the-human-body Microbes and the human body] The Microbiology Society online&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the many organisms that feed on [[faeces]] or dung. A [[cow]] diet consists mainly of grass, the [[cellulose]] of which is transformed into [[lipid]]s by [[micro-organisms]] in the cow's [[large intestine]]. These micro-organisms cannot use the lipids because of lack of [[oxygen]] in the intestine, so the cow does not take up all lipids produced. When the processed grass leaves the intestine as dung and comes into open air, many organisms, such as the [[dung beetle]], feed on it.

Yet another example is the community of micro-organisms in soil that live off leaf litter. Leaves typically last one year and are then replaced by new ones. These micro-organisms mineralize the discarded leaves and release nutrients that are taken up by the plant. Such relationships are called reciprocal syntrophy because the plant lives off the products of micro-organisms. Many&amp;nbsp;[[Symbiosis|symbiotic]]&amp;nbsp;relationships are based on syntrophy.

=== Biodegradation of pollutants ===

Syntrophic microbial food webs can play an integral role in the breakdown of organic pollutants such as oils, aromatic compounds, and amino acids.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Environmental contamination with oil is of high ecological importance, but can be mediated through syntrophic degradation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Alkanes]]&amp;nbsp;are hydrocarbon chains that are the major chemical component of crude oils, and have been experimentally verified to be broken down by syntrophic microbial food webs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Callaghan|first=A.

This breakdown is crucial in the processes of&amp;nbsp;[[bioremediation]]&amp;nbsp;and global carbon cycling.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Syntrophic microbial communities are key players in the breakdown of&amp;nbsp;[[aromatic compounds]], which are common pollutants.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferry|first=J. G.|last2=Wolfe|first2=R. S.|date=February 1976|title=Anaerobic degradation of benzoate to methane by a microbial consortium|journal=Archives of Microbiology|volume=107|issue=1|pages=33–40|issn=0302-8933|pmid=1252087|doi=10.1007/bf00427864}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degradation of aromatic [[Benzoic acid|benzoate]] to [[methane]] produces many intermediate compounds such as [[formate]], [[acetate]], CO2 and H2.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The build up of these products makes benzoate degradation progressively less favourable. These intermediates can then be taken up and metabolized syntrophically by [[methanogens]] to make the whole process more thermodynamically favourable.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Studies have shown that bacterial degradation of&amp;nbsp;[[amino acids]]&amp;nbsp;can be significantly enhanced through the process of syntrophy.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zindel|first=U.|last2=Freudenberg|first2=W.|last3=Rieth|first3=M.|last4=Andreesen|first4=J. R.|last5=Schnell|first5=J.|last6=Widdel|first6=F.|date=1988-07-01|title=Eubacterium acidaminophilum sp. nov., a versatile amino acid-degrading anaerobe producing or utilizing H2 or formate|journal=Archives of Microbiology|language=en|volume=150|issue=3|pages=254–266|doi=10.1007/BF00407789|issn=0302-8933}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microbes growing poorly on amino acid substrates alanine, aspartate, serine, leucine, valine, and glycine can have their rate of growth dramatically increased by syntrophic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; scavengers. These scavengers, like&amp;nbsp;''[[Methanospirillum]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[Acetobacterium]],''&amp;nbsp;metabolize the H2 waste produced during amino acid breakdown, preventing a toxic build-up.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Another way to improve amino acid breakdown is through interspecies electron transfer mediated by formate. Species like ''[[Desulfovibrio]]'' employ this method.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==Metabolic mechanism==
The main motive behind a syntrophic relation between two bacterial organisms is generalized as a relationship where each participant's metabolic activity cannot independently overcome the thermodynamic pressure of the reaction under standard conditions even when a cosubstrate or nutrient is added into the environment. Therefore, the cooperation of the other participant is required to reduce the intermediate pool size.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
The ''Methanobacillus omelianskii'' culture is a classic example in demonstrating how two separate unfavourable reactions can be carried out by syntrophic interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1 = Morris|first1= Brandon E.L.|last2 = Henneberger|first2 = Ruth|last3 = Huber|first3 = Harald|last4 = Moissl-Eichinger|first4 = Christine|date = 2013|title = Microbial syntrophy: interaction for the common good|journal = FEMS Microbiol Rev|volume = 37|issue = 3|pages = 384–406|doi = 10.1111/1574-6976.12019|pmid= 23480449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strain S and strain M.o.H of ''Methanobacillus omelianskii'' oxidize ethanol into acetate and methane by a process called [[interspecies hydrogen transfer]]. Individuals of strain S are observed as obligate anaerobic bacteria that use ethanol as an [[electron donor]], whereas organisms of strain M.o.H are [[methanogens]] that oxidize hydrogen gas to produce methane.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McInerney|first1=Michael J.|last2=Struchtemeyer|first2=Christopher G.|last3=Sieber|first3=Jessica|last4=Mouttaki|first4=Housna|last5=Stams|first5=Alfons J.

Complex organic compounds such as ethanol, propionate, butyrate, and lactate cannot be directly used as substrates for methanogenesis by methanogens. On the other hand, [[fermentation]] of these organic compounds cannot occur in fermenting microorganisms unless the hydrogen concentration is reduced to a low level by the methanogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stams|first1=Alfons J.

'''Biological constraints''' are factors which make [[population]]s resistant to [[evolution]]ary change. One proposed definition of constraint is "A property of a trait that, although possibly adaptive in the environment in which it originally evolved, acts to place limits on the production of new phenotypic variants."&lt;ref&gt;Blomberg, S. P., and T. Garland. 2002. Tempo and mode in evolution: phylogenetic inertia, adaptation and comparative methods. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 15:899–910.&lt;/ref&gt;  Constraint has played an important role in the development of such ideas as [[homology (biology)|homology]] and [[body plan]]s.

== Types of constraint==
Any aspect of an organism that has not changed over a certain period of time could be considered to provide evidence for "constraint" of some sort. To make the concept more useful, it is therefore necessary to divide it into smaller units. First, one can consider the pattern of constraint as evidenced by [[phylogenetic]] analysis and the use of [[phylogenetic comparative methods]]; this is often termed [[Phylogenetic Inertia|phylogenetic inertia]], or phylogenetic constraint. It refers to the tendency of related taxa sharing traits based on phylogeny.  Charles Darwin spoke of this concept in his 1859 book "[[On the Origin of Species]]", as being "Unity of Type" and went on to explain the phenomenon as existing because organisms do not start over from scratch, but have characteristics that are built upon already existing ones that were inherited from their ancestors; and these characteristics likely limit the amount of evolution seen in that new taxa due to these constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = On The Origin of Species|last = Darwin|first = Charles|publisher =|year = 1859|isbn =|location =|pages = Chapter 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

If one sees particular features of organisms that have not changed over rather long periods of time (many generations), then this could suggest some constraint on their ability to change (evolve). However, it is not clear that mere documentation of lack of change in a particular character is good evidence for constraint in the sense of the character being unable to change. For example, long-term [[stabilizing selection]] related to stable environments might cause [[Punctuated_equilibrium#Stasis|stasis]].  It has often been considered more fruitful, to consider constraint in its causal sense: what are the causes of lack of change?

===Stabilizing selection===
The most common explanation for biological constraint is that [[stabilizing selection]] acts on an organism to prevent it changing, for example, so that it can continue to function in a tightly-defined [[ecological niche|niche]]. This may be considered to be a form of external constraint, in the sense that the organism is constrained not by its makeup or genetics, but by its environment. The implication would be that if the population was in a new environment, its previously constrained features would potentially begin to evolve.

===Functional coupling and physico-chemical constraint===
Related to the idea of [[stabilizing selection]] is that of the requirement that organisms function adequately in their environment. Thus, where stabilizing selection acts because of the particular niche that is occupied, mechanical and physico-chemical constraints act in a more general manner. For example, the acceleration caused by [[gravity]] places constraints on the minimum [[bone]] [[density]] and [[Physical_strength|strength]] for an animal of a particular size. Similarly, the properties of [[water]] mean that tissues must have certain [[osmotic]] properties in order to function properly.

Functional coupling takes the idea that organisms are integrated networks of functional interactions (for example, the vertebral column of [[vertebrate]]s is involved in the muscle, nerve, and vascular systems as well as providing support and flexibility) and therefore cannot be radically altered without causing severe functional disruption. This may be viewed as one type of [[trade-off]]. As [[Rupert Riedl]] pointed out, this degree of functional constraint — or burden — generally varies according to position in the organism. Structures literally in the centre of the organism — such as the vertebral column — are often more burdened than those at the periphery, such as hair or toes.

===Lack of genetic variation and developmental integration===
This class of constraint depends on certain types of phenotype not being produced by the genotype (compare stabilizing selection, where there is no constraint on what is produced, but rather on what is naturally selected). For example, for a highly homozygous organism, the degree of observed phenotypic variability in its descendents would be lower than those of a heterozygous one. Similarly, developmental systems may be highly [[canalization (genetics)|canalised]], to prevent the generation of certain types of variation.

==Relationships of constraint classes==
Although they are separate, the types of constraints discussed are nevertheless relatable to each other. In particular, stabilizing selection, mechanical, and physical constraints might lead through time to developmental integration and canalisation. However, without any clear idea of any of these mechanisms, deducing them from mere patterns of stasis as deduced from phylogenetic patterns or the [[fossil record]] remains problematic.&lt;ref&gt;Brakefield, P. M., and J. C. Roskam. 2006. Exploring evolutionary constraints is a task for an integrative evolutionary biology. American Naturalist 168(supplement):S4-S13.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the terminology used to describe constraints has led to confusion.&lt;ref&gt;Antonovics, J., and P. H. van Tienderen. 1991.

A '''polyphenic trait''' is a trait for which multiple, discrete [[phenotype]]s can arise from a single [[genotype]] as a result of differing environmental conditions. It is therefore a special case of [[phenotypic plasticity]].

There are several types of polyphenism in animals, from having sex determined by the environment to the castes of honey bees and other social insects. Some polyphenisms are seasonal, as in some butterflies which have different patterns during the year, and some Arctic animals like the [[snowshoe hare]] and [[Arctic fox]], which are white in winter. Other animals have predator-induced or resource polyphenisms, allowing them to exploit variations in their environment. Some nematode worms can develop either into adults or into resting [[dauer larva]]e according to resource availability.

==Definition==

    D : Tertiary queen &lt;br /&gt;
    E : Soldiers &lt;br /&gt;
    F : Worker]]

A '''polyphenism''' is a biological mechanism that causes a trait to be polyphenic. For example, [[crocodile]]s possess a [[temperature-dependent sex determination| temperature-dependent sex determining polyphenism]], where sex is the trait influenced by variations in nest temperature.&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.1993.0059 |title=On the Effect of Temperature-Dependent Sex Determination on Sex Ratio and Survivorship in Crocodilians |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=252 |issue=1334 |pages=149–155 |year=1993 |last1=Woodward |first1=D. E |last2=Murray |first2=J. D. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When polyphenic forms exist at the same time in the same [[panmictic]] (interbreeding) population they can be compared to [[polymorphism (biology)|genetic polymorphism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ford,  E. B. |authorlink=E. B. Ford |date=1975 |title=Ecological genetics |edition=4th |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall |pages= }}{{page needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With polyphenism the switch between morphs is environmental, but with genetic polymorphism the determination of morph is genetic. These two cases have in common that more than one morph is part of the population at any one time. This is rather different from cases where one morph predictably follows another during, for instance, the course of a year. In essence the latter is normal [[ontogeny]] where young forms can and do have different forms, colours and habits to adults.

The discrete nature of polyphenic traits differentiates them from traits like weight and height, which are also dependent on environmental conditions but vary continuously across a spectrum. When a polyphenism is present, an environmental cue causes the organism to develop along a separate pathway, resulting in distinct morphologies; thus, the response to the environmental cue is “all or nothing.” The nature of these environmental conditions varies greatly, and includes seasonal cues like temperature and moisture, [[pheromone|pheromonal]] cues, [[kairomone|kairomonal]] cues (signals released from one species that can be recognized by another), and nutritional cues.

==Types==

===Sex determination===
Sex-determining polyphenisms allow a species to benefit from [[sexual reproduction]] while permitting an unequal [[gender]] ratio. This can be beneficial to a species because a large female-to-male ratio maximizes reproductive capacity. However, temperature-dependent sex determination (as seen in crocodiles) limits the range in which a species can exist, and makes the species susceptible to endangerment by changes in weather pattern.&lt;ref name="Woodward" /&gt; Temperature-dependent sex determination has been proposed as an explanation for the extinction of the dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gilbert |first1=S.F. |year=2003 |title=Developmental Biology |edition=7th |location=Sunderland, Massachusetts |publisher=Sinauer Associates |pages=727–737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Population-dependent and reversible sex determination, found in animals such as the [[blue wrasse]] fish, have less potential for failure. In the blue wrasse, only one male is found in a given territory: [[larva]]e within the territory develop into females, and adult males will not enter the same territory. If a male dies, one of the females in his territory becomes male, replacing him.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003/&gt; While this system ensures that there will always be a mating couple when two animals of the same species are present, it could potentially decrease genetic variance in a population, for example if the females remain in a single male's territory.

===Insect castes===
[[File:Closeup on honeypot ants (Myrmecocystus mimicus) at Oakland Zoo.jpg|thumb|Insect castes: Replete and worker honeypot ants ''[[Myrmecocystus mimicus]]'']]

The caste system of insects enables [[eusociality]], the division of labor between non-breeding and breeding individuals. A series of polyphenisms determines whether larvae develop into queens, workers, and, in some cases soldiers. In the case of the [[ant]], ''P. morrisi'', an embryo must develop under certain temperature and photoperiod conditions in order to become a reproductively-active queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1071468 |pmid=12114626 |title=Evolution of the Gene Network Underlying Wing Polyphenism in Ants |journal=Science |volume=297 |issue=5579 |pages=249–52 |year=2002 |last1=Abouheif |first1=E. |last2=Wray |first2=G. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for control of the mating season but, like sex determination, limits the spread of the species into certain [[climate]]s.
In bees, [[royal jelly]] provided by [[worker bee]]s causes a developing larva to become a [[queen bee|queen]]. Royal jelly is only produced when the queen is aging or has died. This system is less subject to influence by environmental conditions, yet prevents unnecessary production of queens.

===Seasonal===&lt;!-- [[Seasonal polyphenism]] redirects here --&gt;
{{further|Snow camouflage}}

Polyphenic [[biological pigment|pigmentation]] is adaptive for insect species that undergo multiple mating seasons each year. Different pigmentation patterns provide appropriate [[camouflage]] throughout the seasons, as well as alter heat retention as temperatures change.&lt;ref name="Braendle2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/bies.20456 |pmid=16937342 |title=A role for genetic accommodation in evolution? |journal=BioEssays |volume=28 |issue=9 |pages=868–73 |year=2006 |last1=Braendle |first1=Christian |last2=Flatt |first2=Thomas }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because insects cease growth and development after [[eclosion]], their pigment pattern is invariable in adulthood: thus, a polyphenic pigment adaptation would be less valuable for species whose adult form survives longer than one year.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003/&gt;

Birds and mammals are capable of continued physiological changes in adulthood, and some display reversible seasonal polyphenisms, such as in the [[Arctic fox]], which becomes all white in winter as [[snow camouflage]].&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003/&gt;

===Predator-induced===
Predator-induced polyphenisms allow the species to develop in a more reproductively-successful way in a [[predator]]'s absence, but to otherwise assume a more defensible morphology. However, this can fail if the predator evolves to stop producing the [[kairomone]] to which the prey responds. For example, the fly larvae that feed on ''Daphnia cucullata'' (a [[water flea]]) release a kairomone that ''Daphnia'' can detect. When the fly larvae are present, ''Daphnia'' grow large helmets that protect them from being eaten. However, when the predator is absent, ''Daphnia'' have smaller heads and are therefore more agile swimmers.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003/&gt;

===Resource===
Organisms with resource polyphenisms show alternative phenotypes that allow differential use of food or other resources. One example is the [[Spea|western spadefoot toad]], which maximizes its reproductive capacity in temporary [[desert]] ponds. While the water is at a safe level, the tadpoles develop slowly on a diet of other opportunistic pond inhabitants. However, when the water level is low and desiccation is imminent, the tadpoles develop a morphology (wide mouth, strong jaw) that permits them to cannibalize. Cannibalistic tadpoles receive better nutrition and thus metamorphose more quickly, avoiding death as the pond dries up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00442-004-1672-6 |pmid=15300488 |title=Reassessment of the environmental mechanisms controlling developmental polyphenism in spadefoot toad tadpoles |journal=Oecologia |volume=141 |issue=3 |pages=402–10 |year=2004 |last1=Storz |first1=Brian L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among [[invertebrates]], the nematode ''[[Pristionchus pacificus]]'' has one morph that primarily feeds on bacteria and a second morph that produces large teeth, enabling it to feed on other nematodes, including competitors for bacterial food. In this species, cues of starvation and crowding by other nematodes, as sensed by pheromones, trigger a [[hormone|hormonal]] signal that ultimately activates a developmental switch gene that specifies formation of the predatory morph.&lt;ref name="Ragsdale2013"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2013.09.054 |pmid=24209628 |title=A Developmental Switch Coupled to the Evolution of Plasticity Acts through a Sulfatase |journal=Cell |volume=155 |issue=4 |pages=922–33 |year=2013 |last1=Ragsdale |first1=Erik J. |last2=Müller |first2=Manuela R. |last3=Rödelsperger |first3=Christian |last4=Sommer |first4=Ralf J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Density-dependent ===
Density-dependent polyphenism allows species to show a different phenotype based on the population density in which it was reared. In [[Lepidoptera]], [[African armyworm]] larvae exhibit one of two appearances: the gregarious or solitary phase. Under crowded or "gregarious" conditions, the larvae have black bodies and yellow stripes along their bodies. However, under solitary conditions, they have green bodies with a brown stripe down their backs. The different phenotypes emerge during the third instar and remain until the last instar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1570-7458.1998.00273.x |title=The determination of larval phase coloration in the African armyworm, Spodoptera exempta and its consequences for thermoregulation and protection from UV light |journal=Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata |volume=86 |issue=2 |pages=125–33 |year=1998 |last1=Gunn |first1=A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dauer diapause in nematodes===
[[File:Third stage Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita.png|thumb|Third stage [[dauer larva]] (resting stage) of ''[[Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita]]'']]

Under conditions of stress such as crowding and high temperature, L2 larvae of some free living nematodes such as ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' can switch development to the so-called [[dauer larva]] state, instead of going the normal molts into a reproductive adult. These dauer larvae are a stress-resistant, non-feeding, long-lived stage, enabling the animals to survive harsh conditions. On return to favorable conditions, the animal resumes reproductive development from L3 stage onwards.

==Evolution==
A mechanism has been proposed for the [[evolution]]ary development of polyphenisms:&lt;ref name="Braendle2006" /&gt;

#A mutation results in a novel, heritable trait.
#The trait’s frequency expands in the population, creating a population on which selection can act.
#Pre-existing (background) genetic variation in other genes results in phenotypic differences in expression of the new trait.
#These phenotypic differences undergo selection; as genotypic differences narrow, the trait becomes:
##Genetically fixed (non-responsive to environmental conditions)
##Polyphenic (responsive to environmental conditions)

Evolution of novel polyphenisms through this mechanism has been demonstrated in the laboratory. Suzuki and Nijhout used an existing mutation (''black'') in a monophenic green hornworm (''[[Manduca sexta]]'') that causes a black phenotype. They found that if larvae from an existing population of ''black'' mutants were raised at 20˚C, then all the final [[instar]] larvae were black; but if the larvae were instead raised at 28˚C, the final instar larvae ranged in color from black to green. By selecting for larvae that were black if raised at 20˚C but green if raised at 28˚C, they produced a polyphenic strain after thirteen generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1118888 |pmid=16456077 |title=Evolution of a Polyphenism by Genetic Accommodation |journal=Science |volume=311 |issue=5761 |pages=650–2 |year=2006 |last1=Suzuki |first1=Y |last2=Nijhout |first2=H. F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This fits the model described above because a new mutation (black) was required to reveal pre-existing genetic variation and to permit selection. Furthermore, the production of a polyphenic strain was only possible because of background variation within the species: two alleles, one temperature-sensitive and one stable, were present for a single gene upstream of ''black'' (in the pigment production pathway) before selection occurred. The temperature-sensitive allele was not observable because at high temperatures, it caused an increase in green pigment in hornworms that were already bright green. However, introduction of the black mutant caused the temperature-dependent changes in pigment production to become obvious. The researchers could then select for larvae with the temperature-sensitive [[allele]], resulting in a polyphenism.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

[[File:201_Elements_of_the_Human_Body-01.jpg|thumb|Element percentages in the human body.]]

'''Trace metals''' are the [[metal]]s subset of [[trace element]]s; that is, metals normally present in small but measurable amounts in [[animal]] and [[plant]] cells and tissues and that are a necessary part of [[nutrition]] and [[physiology]]. Many [[biometal (biology)|biometal]]s are trace metals. Ingestion of, or exposure to, excessive quantities can be [[toxicity|toxic]]. However, insufficient plasma or tissue levels of certain trace metals can cause [[pathology]], as is the case with iron.

Trace metals within the human body include [[iron]], [[lithium]], [[zinc]], [[copper]], [[chromium]], [[nickel]], [[cobalt]], [[vanadium]], [[molybdenum]], [[manganese]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |others=Series editors Sigel, Astrid; Sigel, Helmut; Sigel, Roland K.O.

Trace metals are metals needed by living organisms to function properly and are depleted through the expenditure of energy by various metabolic processes of living organisms. They are replenished in animals through diet as well as environmental exposure, and in plants through the uptake of nutrients from the soil in which the plant grows. Human [[vitamin]] pills and plant [[fertilizer]]s can be a source of trace metals.

Trace metals are sometimes referred to as trace elements, although the latter includes minerals and is a broader category. See also [[Dietary mineral]]. Trace elements are required by the body for specific functions. Things such as vitamins, sports drinks, fresh fruits and vegetables are sources. Taken in excessive amounts, trace elements can cause problems. For example fluorine is required for the formation of bones and enamel on teeth. However, when taken in an excessive amount can cause a disease called "Fluorosis', in which bone deformations and yellowing of teeth are seen. Fluorine can occur naturally in some areas in ground water.

Trace metals include iron that can help to prevent anemia, and zinc that is a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] in over 100 enzyme reactions.

[[File:Heterochronism of adaptation.svg|thumb|400px|'''Heterochronism of supercompensation''': Different parameters require different amounts of time to recover after strain. [[Tendon]]s and [[bone tissue]] require considerably longer to adapt than muscle tissue.]]
In [[sports science]] theory, '''supercompensation''' is the post training period during which the trained function/parameter has a higher performance capacity than it did prior to the training period.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humankinetics.com/excerpts/excerpts/defining-supercompensation-training&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Supercompensation.svg|thumb|right|400px|Initial fitness, training, recovery, and supercompensation]]
The [[physical fitness|fitness]] level of a [[human]] body in training can be broken down into four periods: initial fitness, parietal fitness  [[training]], recovery, and '''supercompensation'''.  During the initial fitness period, the target of the training has a base level of fitness (shown by the first time sector in the graph). Upon entering the training period, the target's level of fitness decreases (shown by the second time sector in the graph).  After training, the body enters the recovery period during which level of fitness increases up to the initial fitness level (shown by the third time sector in the graph).  Because the human body is an adjustable [[organism]], it will feel the need to adjust itself to a higher level of fitness in anticipation of the next training session. Accordingly, the increase in fitness following a training session does not stop at the initial fitness level.  Instead the body enters a period of supercompensation during which fitness surpasses the initial fitness level (shown by the fourth time sector in the graph).  If there are no further workouts, this fitness level will slowly decline back towards the initial fitness level (shown by the last time sector in the graph). First put forth by Russian scientist [[Nikolai N. Yakovlev (1911–1992)]] in 1949-1959,&lt;ref&gt;http://jap.physiology.org/content/jap/92/4/1378.full.pdf/&lt;/ref&gt; this theory is a basic principle of athletic training.

If the next workout takes place during the recovery period, [[overtraining]] may occur. If the next workout takes place during the supercompensation period, the body will advance to a higher level of fitness. If the next workout takes place after the supercompensation period, the body will remain at the base level.

More complex variations are possible; for instance, sometimes a few workouts are intentionally made in the recovery period to achieve greater supercompensation effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marrier|first=Bruno|last2=Robineau|first2=Julien|last3=Piscione|first3=Julien|last4=Lacome|first4=Mathieu|last5=Peeters|first5=Alexis|last6=Hausswirth|first6=Christophe|last7=Morin|first7=Jean-Benoît|last8=Meur|first8=Yann Le|date=2017-01-25|title=Supercompensation Kinetics of Physical Qualities During a Taper in Team Sport Athletes|url=http://journals.humankinetics.com/doi/abs/10.1123/ijspp.2016-0607|journal=International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance|pages=1–24|doi=10.1123/ijspp.2016-0607|issn=1555-0265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The relation between supercompensation and training programs ==
At a first glance, creating effective training programs might look simple. All you need is to determine the intensity level and how long it takes you to get to the supercompensation period. Afterwards, continue training with the intensity level that was determined previously and keep the necessary intervals between workouts required for supercompensation. However, things become more complex because training affects many different bodily functions and parameters.  Each bodily function or parameter has a different recovery time, a different amount of time needed to reach peak supercompensation, a different amount of time between supercompensation peak and return to base fitness.

The aforementioned functions and parameters are basic ones. [[Muscle strength]] and mass are complex parameters. For instance, [[muscle mass]] is a function of many different simple parameters.  For example, amount of glycogen in muscles is a basic parameter that influences muscle mass.

== Use of supercompensation in practice ==
In classical [[sport science]], the yearly (sometimes multi-yearly) period is divided to micro and macro cycles, where each microcycle is responsible for the development of a specific (sometimes several) basic training function and parameter, whereas macrocycles are responsible for the development of complex parameters/functions (such as muscle strength). During each microcycle, the resting period is the same as the amount of time needed for reaching the supercompensation stage of the current training parameter/function (also during such a micro cycle there shouldn't be any negative influence on the recovery of the main function). Such a training method will work only when the developed functions/parameters are non-related. Unfortunately, for muscle strength and mass this is not the case (functions/parameters are related). Therefore, for muscle strength and mass different approaches are needed. During a training cycle the intensity and volume of training varies, waves of different functions are overlaid so that until the end of the microcycle supercompensation of the main required functions is achieved.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20850">'''Kin recognition''', also called '''kin detection''', is an organism's ability to distinguish between close genetic kin and non-kin. In [[evolutionary biology]] and [[psychology]], such an ability is presumed to have evolved for [[inbreeding avoidance]].

An additional [[adaptation|adaptive function]] sometimes posited for kin recognition is a role in [[kin selection]]. There is debate over this, since in strict theoretical terms kin recognition is not necessary for kin selection or the cooperation associated with it. Rather, [[eusociality|social behaviour]] can emerge by kin selection in the demographic conditions of 'viscous populations' with organisms interacting in their natal context, without active kin discrimination, since social participants by default typically share recent common origin. Since kin selection theory emerged, much research has been produced investigating the possible role of kin recognition mechanisms in mediating altruism. Taken as a whole, this research suggests that active powers of recognition play a negligible role in mediating social cooperation relative to less elaborate cue-based and context-based mechanisms, such as familiarity, [[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]] and phenotype matching.

Because cue-based 'recognition' predominates in social mammals, outcomes are non-deterministic in relation to actual genetic kinship, instead outcomes simply reliably correlate with genetic kinship in an organism's typical conditions. A well-known human example of an inbreeding avoidance mechanism is the [[Westermarck effect]], in which unrelated individuals who happen to spend their childhood in the same household find each other sexually unattractive. Similarly, due to the cue-based mechanisms that mediate social bonding and cooperation, unrelated individuals who grow up together in this way are also likely to demonstrate strong [[Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship|social and emotional ties, and enduring altruism]].

==Theoretical background==
The English evolutionary biologist [[W. D. Hamilton]]'s theory of [[inclusive fitness]], and the related theory of [[kin selection]], were formalized in the 1960s and 1970s to explain the evolution of social behaviours. Hamilton's early papers, as well as giving a mathematical account of the selection pressure, discussed possible implications and behavioural manifestations. Hamilton considered potential roles of cue-based mechanisms mediating altruism versus 'positive powers' of kin discrimination:

{{quote|The selective advantage which makes behaviour conditional in the right sense on the discrimination of factors which correlate with the relationship of the individual concerned is therefore obvious. It may be, for instance, that in respect of a certain social action performed towards neighbours indiscriminately, an individual is only just breaking even in terms of inclusive fitness. If he could learn to recognise those of his neighbours who really were close relatives and could devote his beneficial actions to them alone an advantage to inclusive fitness would at once appear. Thus a mutation causing such discriminatory behaviour itself benefits inclusive fitness and would be selected. In fact, the individual may not need to perform any discrimination so sophisticated as we suggest here; a difference in the generosity of his behaviour according to whether the situations evoking it were encountered near to, or far from, his own home might occasion an advantage of a similar kind." (1996 [1964], 51)&lt;ref name="H1964"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamilton |first=William D. |year=1964 |title=The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour |journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=1–52 |doi= 10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4 |pmid=5875341}} Reprinted in. 1996. ''Narrow Roads of Gene Land. Vol. 1.'' Oxford: W. H. Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These two possibilities, [[altruism]] mediated via 'passive situation' or via 'sophisticated discrimination', stimulated a generation of researchers to look for evidence of any 'sophisticated' kin discrimination. However, Hamilton later (1987) developed his thinking to consider that "an innate kin recognition adaptation" was unlikely to play a role in mediating altruistic behaviours:

{{quote|But once again, we do not expect anything describable as an innate kin recognition adaptation, used for social behaviour other than mating, for the reasons already given in the hypothetical case of the trees.(Hamilton 1987, 425)&lt;ref name="H1987"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hamilton |first=W. D. |year=1987 |chapter=Discriminating nepotism: expectable, common and overlooked |title=Kin recognition in animals |editor-first=D. J. C. |editor-last=Fletcher |editor2-first=C. D. |editor2-last=Michener |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0471911999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The implication that the [[inclusive fitness]] criterion can be met by mediating mechanisms of cooperative behaviour that are context and location-based has been clarified by recent work by West ''et al.'':

{{quote|In his original papers on inclusive fitness theory, Hamilton pointed out a sufficiently high relatedness to favour altruistic behaviours could accrue in two ways — kin discrimination or limited dispersal (Hamilton, 1964, 1971, 1972, 1975). There is a huge theoretical literature on the possible role of limited dispersal reviewed by Platt &amp; Bever (2009) and West et al. (2002a), as well as experimental evolution tests of these models (Diggle et al., 2007; Griffin et al., 2004; Kümmerli et al., 2009 ). However, despite this, it is still sometimes claimed that kin selection requires kin discrimination (Oates &amp; Wilson, 2001; Silk, 2002 ). Furthermore, a large number of authors appear to have implicitly or explicitly assumed that kin discrimination is the only mechanism by which altruistic behaviours can be directed towards relatives... [T]here is a huge industry of papers reinventing limited dispersal as an explanation for cooperation. The mistakes in these areas seem to stem from the incorrect assumption that kin selection or indirect fitness benefits require kin discrimination (misconception 5), despite the fact that Hamilton pointed out the potential role of limited dispersal in his earliest papers on inclusive fitness theory (Hamilton, 1964; Hamilton, 1971; Hamilton, 1972; Hamilton, 1975). (West et al. 2010, p. 243 and supplement)&lt;ref name="W2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last=West |title=Sixteen common misconceptions about the evolution of cooperation in humans |journal=[[Evolution and Social Behaviour]] |volume=32 |year=2011 |issue=4 |pages=231–262 |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2010.08.001 |display-authors=etal|citeseerx=10.1.1.188.3318 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For a recent review of the debates around kin recognition and their role in the wider debates about how to interpret [[inclusive fitness]] theory, including its compatibility with ethnographic data on human kinship, see Holland (2012).&lt;ref name="SBNK"&gt;Holland, Maximilian. (2012) [[Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship|''Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches'']]. North Charleston: Createspace Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Leading [[inclusive fitness]] theorists such as Grafen have argued that the whole research program around kin recognition is somewhat misguided:

{{quote|Do animals really recognise kin in a way that is different from the way they recognise mates, neighbours, and other organisms and objects?’. Certainly animals use recognition systems to recognise their offspring, their siblings and their parents. But to the extent that they do so in the same way that they recognise their mates and their neighbours, I feel it is unhelpful to say they have a kin recognition system."
(Grafen 1991, 1095)&lt;ref name="G1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grafen |first=A. |year=1991 |title=Development, the Conveniently Forgotten Variable in True Kin Recognition - Reply |journal=[[Animal Behaviour (journal)|Animal Behaviour]] |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=1091–1092 |doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(05)80649-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Others have cast similar doubts over the enterprise:

{{quote|[T]he fact that animals benefit from engaging in spatially mediated behaviors is not evidence that these animals can recognize their kin, nor does it support the conclusion that spatially based differential behaviors represent a kin recognition mechanism (see also discussions by Blaustein, 1983; Waldman, 1987; Halpin 1991). In other words, from an evolutionary perspective it may well be advantageous for kin to aggregate and for individuals to behave preferentially towards nearby kin, whether or not this behaviour is the result of kin recognition per se" (Tang-Martinez 2001, 25)&lt;ref name="TM2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tang-Martinez |first=Z. |year=2001 |title=The mechanisms of kin discrimination and the evolution of kin recognition in vertebrates: a critical re-evaluation |journal=[[Behavioural Processes]] |volume=53 |issue=1–2 |pages=21–40 |doi=10.1016/S0376-6357(00)00148-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Experimental evidence==
Kin recognition is a behavioral adaptation noted in many species but proximate level mechanisms are not well documented. Recent studies have shown that kin recognition can result from a multitude of sensory input. Jill Mateo notes that there are three components are prominent in kin recognition. First, "production of unique phenotypic cues or labels". Second, "perception of these labels and the degree of correspondence of these labels with a 'recognition template'", and finally the recognition of the phenotypes should lead to "action taken by the animal as a function of the perceived similarity between its template and an encountered phenotype".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mateo |first=Jill M. |title=Kin Recognition in Ground Squirrels and Other Rodents |journal=[[Journal of Mammalogy]] |volume=84 |issue=4 |year=2003 |pages=1163–1181 |doi=10.1644/BLe-011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three components allow for several possible mechanisms of kin recognition. Sensory information gathered from visual, olfactory and auditory stimuli are the most prevalent. The [[belding ground squirrel]] kin produce similar odors in comparison to non-kin. Mateo notes that the squirrels spent longer investigating non-kin scents suggesting recognition of kin odor. It's also noted that belding's ground squirrels produce at least two scents arising from dorsal and oral secretions, giving two opportunities for kin recognition. Auditory distinctions have been noted among avian species. [[Long-tailed tit]]s (''Aegithalos caudatus'') are capable of discriminating kin and non-kin based on contact calls. Distinguishing calls are often learned from adults during the nestling period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sharp |first=Stuart P. |title=Learned kin recognition cues in a social bird |journal=Nature |volume=434 |issue=7037 |year=2005 |pages=1127–1130 |doi=10.1038/nature03522 |display-authors=etal |pmid=15858573}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies suggest that the bald-faced hornet, ''[[Dolichovespula maculata]]'', can recognize nest mates by their cuticular hydrocarbon profile, which produces a distinct smell.&lt;ref&gt;Discrimination Between Natal and Non- Natal Nests by the Social Wasps Dolichovespula maculata and Polistes fuscatus. Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society. Deanna Ferguson, George J. Gamboa and Julia K. Jones. Departement of Biological Sciences, Oakland University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kin recognition in some species may also be mediated by immunogenetic similarity of the [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Villinger |first=J. |last2=Waldman |first2=B. |year=2012 |title=Social discrimination by quantitative assessment of immunogenetic similarity |journal=Proc. R. Soc. B |volume=279 |issue=1746 |pages=4368–4374 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2012.1279 |pmid=22951741 |pmc=3479794 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a discussion of the interaction of these social and biological kin recognition factors see Lieberman, Tooby, and Cosmides (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lieberman |first=D. |last2=Tooby |first2=J. |last3=Cosmides |first3=L. |title=The architecture of human kin detection |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=445 |issue=7129 |pages=727–731 |year=2007 |doi=10.1038/nature05510 |pmid=17301784 |pmc=3581061}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have suggested that, as applied to humans, this nature-nurture interactionist perspective allows a synthesis&lt;ref name="SBNK" /&gt; between theories and evidence of social bonding and cooperation across the fields of evolutionary biology, psychology ([[attachment theory]]) and cultural anthropology ([[nurture kinship]]).

==In plants==
Kin recognition is an adaptive behavior observed in living beings to prevent inbreeding, and increase fitness of populations, individuals and genes. Kin recognition is the key to successful [[reciprocal altruism]], a behavior that increases reproductive success of both organisms involved. Reciprocal altruism as a product of kin recognition has been observed and studied in many animals, and more recently, [[plants]]. Due to the nature of plant reproduction and growth, plants are more likely than animals to live in close proximity to family members, and therefore stand to gain more from the ability to differentiate kin from strangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Waldman|first=B. |year=1988|title=The Ecology of Kin Recognition |journal=Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics |volume=19 |pages=543–571 |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.19.110188.002551 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, botanists have been conducting studies to determine which plant species can recognize kin, and discover the responses of plants to neighboring kin. Murphy and Dudley (2009) shows that ''[[Impatiens pallida]]'' has the ability to recognize individuals closely related to them and those not related to them. The physiological response to this recognition is increasingly interesting. ''I. pallida'' responds to kin by increasing branchiness and stem elongation, to prevent shading relatives, and responds to strangers by increasing leaf to root allocation, as a form of competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Murphy|first1=G. |last2=Dudley|first2=S. |year=2009|title=Kin recognition: Competition and cooperation in Impatiens (Balsaminaceae) |journal=American Journal of Botany |volume=96 |issue=11 |doi=10.3732/ajb.0900006 |pages=1990–1996 |pmid=21622319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Bhatt et al. (2010) show that ''Cakile edentula'', the American sea rocket, has the ability to allocate more energy to root growth, and competition, in response to growing next to a stranger, and allocates less energy to root growth when planted next to a sibling. This reduces competition between siblings and increases fitness of relatives growing next to each other, while still allowing competition between non-relative plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bhatt|first=M. |year=2010|title=Kin recognition, not competitive interactions, predicts root allocation in young Cakile edentula seedling pairs |journal=New Phytologist |volume=189 |issue=4 |pages=1135–1142 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03548.x |pmid=21118260 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about the mechanisms involved in kin recognition. They most likely vary between species as well as within species. A study by Bierdrzycki et al. (2010) shows that root secretions are necessary for ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' to recognize kin vs. strangers, but not necessary to recognize self vs. non-self roots. This study was performed using secretion inhibitors, which disabled the mechanism responsible for kin recognition in this species, and showed similar growth patterns to Bhatt et al., (2010) and Murphy and Dudley (2009) in control groups. The most interesting result of this study was that inhibiting root secretions did not reduce the ability of ''Arabidopsis'' to recognize their own roots, which implicates a separate mechanism for self/non-self recognition than that for kin/stranger recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bierdrzycki|first=M. |year=2010|title=Root exudates mediate kin recognition in plants |journal=Communicative &amp; Integrative Biology |volume=3 |pages=28–35 |doi=10.4161/cib.3.1.10118 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While this mechanism in the roots responds to exudates and involves competition over resources like nitrogen and phosphorus, another mechanism has been recently proposed, which involves competition over light, in which kin recognition takes place in leaves. In their 2014 study, Crepy and Casal conducted multiple experiments on different accessions of ''A. thaliana''. These experiments showed that ''Arabidopsis'' accessions have distinct R:FR and blue light signatures, and that these signatures can be detected by photoreceptors, which allows the plant to recognize its neighbor as a relative or non-relative. Not much is known about the pathway that ''Arabidopsis'' uses to associate these light patterns with kin, however, researchers ascertained that photoreceptors phyB, cry 1, cry 2, phot1, and phot2 are involved in the process by performing a series of experiments with knock-out mutants. Researchers also concluded that the auxin-synthesis gene TAA1 is involved in the process, downstream of the photoreceptors, by performing a similar experiments using Sav3 knock-out mutants. This mechanism leads to altered leaf direction to prevent shading of related neighbors and to reduce competition for sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Crepy|first=M. |year=2014|title=RoPhotoreceptor-mediated kin recognition in plants. |journal=New Phytologist |volume=205 |issue=1 |pages=329–38 |doi=10.1111/nph.13040 |pmid=25264216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inbreeding avoidance==
{{main|Inbreeding avoidance}}

When mice inbreed with close relatives in their natural habitat, there is a significant detrimental effect on progeny survival.&lt;ref name="pmid7939661"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jiménez JA, Hughes KA, Alaks G, Graham L, Lacy RC |title=An experimental study of inbreeding depression in a natural habitat |journal=Science |volume=266 |issue=5183 |pages=271–3 |year=1994 |pmid=7939661 |doi= 10.1126/science.7939661}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since inbreeding is detrimental, it tends to be avoided. In the [[house mouse]], the [[Major urinary proteins|major urinary protein]] (MUP) gene cluster provides a highly polymorphic scent signal of genetic identity that appears to underlie kin recognition and inbreeding avoidance.  Thus there are fewer matings between mice sharing MUP haplotypes than would be expected if there were random mating.&lt;ref name="pmid17997307"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sherborne AL, Thom MD, Paterson S, Jury F, Ollier WE, Stockley P, Beynon RJ, Hurst JL |title=The genetic basis of inbreeding avoidance in house mice |journal=Curr. Biol. |volume=17 |issue=23 |pages=2061–6 |year=2007 |pmid=17997307 |pmc=2148465 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.10.041}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another mechanism for avoiding inbreeding is evident when a female house mouse mates with multiple males. In such a case, there appears to be egg-driven sperm selection against sperm from related males.&lt;ref name="pmid26154782"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Firman RC, Simmons LW |title=Gametic interactions promote inbreeding avoidance in house mice |journal=Ecol. Lett. |volume=18 |issue=9 |pages=937–43 |year=2015 |pmid=26154782 |doi=10.1111/ele.12471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[toad]]s, male advertisement vocalizations may serve as cues by which females recognize their kin and thus avoid inbreeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waldman | first1 = B | last2 = Rice | first2 = JE | last3 = Honeycutt | first3 = RL | year = 1992 | title = Kin recognition and incest avoidance in toads| journal = Am. Zool. | volume = 32 | pages = 18–30 | doi = 10.1093/icb/32.1.18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Dioecy|dioecious]] plants, the [[Stigma (botany)|stigma]] may receive [[pollen]] from several different potential donors. As multiple [[pollen tube]]s from the different donors grow through the stigma to reach the [[Ovary (botany)|ovary]], the receiving maternal plant may carry out pollen selection favoring pollen from less related donor plants.&lt;ref name=Teixeira&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Teixeira S, Foerster K, Bernasconi G |title=Evidence for inbreeding depression and post-pollination selection against inbreeding in the dioecious plant Silene latifolia |journal=Heredity (Edinb) |volume=102 |issue=2 |pages=101–12 |year=2009 |pmid=18698334 |doi=10.1038/hdy.2008.86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, kin recognition at the level of the pollen tube apparently leads to post-pollination selection to avoid inbreeding depression. Also, seeds may be aborted selectively depending on donor–recipient relatedness.&lt;ref name=Teixeira /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12895">'''Biological thermodynamics''' is the quantitative study of the energy transductions that occur in or between living organisms, structures, and cells and of the nature and function of the chemical processes underlying these transductions. Biological thermodynamics may address the question of whether the benefit associated with any particular [[phenotype|phenotypic]] trait is worth the energy investment it requires.

==History==
German-British medical doctor and biochemist [[Hans Adolf Krebs|Hans Krebs]]' 1957 book ''Energy Transformations in Living Matter'' (written with [[Hans Kornberg]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Alberty R |author-link=Robert Alberty |title=A short history of the thermodynamics of enzyme-catalyzed reactions |journal=J Biol Chem |volume=279 |issue=27 |pages=27831–6 |year=2004 |pmid=15073189 |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/279/27/27831 |doi=10.1074/jbc.X400003200}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first major publication on the thermodynamics of biochemical reactions. In addition, the appendix contained the first-ever published thermodynamic tables, written by [[Kenneth Burton]], to contain equilibrium constants and [[Gibbs free energy]] of formations for [[chemical specie]]s, able to calculate [[biochemical reaction]]s that had not yet occurred.

[[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics]] has been applied for explaining how biological organisms can develop from disorder. [[Ilya Prigogine]] developed methods for the thermodynamic treatment of such systems. He called these systems [[dissipative systems]], because they are formed and maintained by the dissipative processes that exchange energy between the system and its environment, and because they disappear if that exchange ceases. It may be said that they live in symbiosis with their environment. Energy transformations in biology are dependent primarily on [[photosynthesis]].  The total energy captured by photosynthesis in green plants from the solar radiation is about 2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; joules of energy per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Global Environmental Change in the Ocean and on Land|editor=M. Shiyomi|display-editors=etal|pages=343–358|chapter=Global Mapping of Terrestrial Primary Productivity and Light-Use Efficiency with a Process-Based Model|url=http://www.terrapub.co.jp/e-library/kawahata/pdf/343.pdf|author=Akihiko Ito|author2=Takehisa Oikawa|last-author-amp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annual energy captured by photosynthesis in green plants is about 4% of the total [[sunlight]] energy that reaches Earth. The energy transformations in biological communities surrounding [[hydrothermal vent]]s are exceptions; they oxidize [[sulfur]], obtaining their energy via [[chemosynthesis]] rather than photosynthesis.

== The focus of thermodynamics in biology==

The field of biological thermodynamics is focused on principles of [[chemical thermodynamics]] in [[biology]] and [[biochemistry]].  Principles covered include the [[first law of thermodynamics]], the [[second law of thermodynamics]], [[Gibbs free energy]], [[statistical thermodynamics]], [[reaction kinetics]], and on hypotheses of the origin of life.  Presently, biological thermodynamics concerns itself with the study of internal biochemical dynamics as: ATP hydrolysis, protein stability, DNA binding, membrane diffusion, enzyme kinetics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.emc.maricopa.edu/faculty/farabee/BIOBK/BioBookEnzym.html|chapter=Reactions and Enzymes|author=M.J. Farabee|title=On-Line Biology Book|publisher=Estrella Mountain Community College|access-date=2006-09-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228002422/http://www.emc.maricopa.edu/faculty/farabee/biobk/biobookenzym.html|archive-date=2012-12-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other such essential energy controlled pathways. In terms of thermodynamics, the amount of energy capable of doing work during a chemical reaction is measured quantitatively by the change in the [[Gibbs free energy]]. The physical biologist [[Alfred Lotka]] attempted to unify the change in the Gibbs free energy with evolutionary theory.

=== Energy transformation in biological systems ===

The sun is the primary source of energy for living organisms. Some living organisms like plants need sunlight directly while other organisms like humans can acquire energy from the sun indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haynie|first=Donald T.|title=Biological Thermodynamics|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is however evidence that some bacteria can thrive in harsh environments like Antarctica as evidence by the blue-green algae beneath thick layers of ice in the lakes. No matter what the type of living species, all living organisms must capture, transduce, store, and use energy to live.

The relationship between the energy of the incoming sunlight and its wavelength {{math|λ}} or frequency {{math|ν}} is given by

:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = h\nu,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]] (6.63x10&lt;sup&gt;−34&lt;/sup&gt;Js) and ''c'' is the speed of light (2.998x10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m/s). Plants trap this energy from the sunlight and undergo photosynthesis, effectively converting solar energy into chemical energy. To transfer the energy once again, animals will feed on plants and use the energy of digested plant materials to create biological macromolecules.

=== Thermodynamic Theory of Evolution ===
The biological evolution may be explained through a thermodynamic theory. The four laws of thermodynamics are used to frame the biological theory behind [[evolution]]. The [[first law of thermodynamics]] states that states that energy can not be created or destroyed. No life can create energy but must obtain it through its environment. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that energy can be transformed and that occurs everyday in lifeforms. As organisms take energy from their environment they can transform it into useful energy. This is the foundation of tropic dynamics.

The general example is that the open system can be defined as any ecosystem that moves toward maximizing the dispersal of energy. All things strive towards maximum [[entropy]] production, which in terms of evolution, occurs in changes in DNA to increase [[biodiversity]]. Thus, diversity can be linked to the second law of thermodynamics. Diversity can also be argued to be a diffusion process that diffuses toward a dynamic equilibrium to maximize entropy. Therefore, thermodynamics can explain the direction and rate of evolution along with the direction and rate of succession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skene|first=Keith|date=July 31, 2015|title=Life’s a Gas: A Thermodynamic Theory of Biological Evolution|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/29af/6b1393d3cf3bf8a96c6af6d42b650fb5c8f7.pdf|journal=Entropy|volume=|pages=27|via=MDPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

=== First Law of Thermodynamics ===
The First Law of Thermodynamics is a statement of the conservation of energy; though it can be changed from one form to another, energy can be neither created nor destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Haynie, Donald T.|title=Biological Thermodynamics|publisher=Cambridge UP|year= 2001|isbn=9780521795494}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the first law, a principle called [[Hess's Law]] arises. Hess’s Law states that the heat absorbed or evolved in a given reaction must always be constant and independent of the manner in which the reaction takes place. Although some intermediate reactions may be endothermic and others may be exothermic, the total heat exchange is equal to the heat exchange had the process occurred directly. This principle is the basis for the [[calorimeter]], a device used to determine the amount of heat in a chemical reaction. Since all incoming energy enters the body as food and is ultimately oxidized, the total heat production may be estimated by measuring the heat produced by the oxidation of food in a calorimeter. This heat is expressed in [[kilocalorie]]s, which are the common unit of food energy found on nutrition labels.&lt;ref&gt;Stacy, Ralph W., David T. Williams, Ralph E. Worden, and Rex O. McMorris. Essentials of Biological and Medical Physics. New York: McGraw-Hill Book, 1955. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second Law of Thermodynamics ===
The Second Law of Thermodynamics is concerned primarily with whether or not a given process is possible. The Second Law states that no natural process can occur unless it is accompanied by an increase in the entropy of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Haynie, Donald T. Biological Thermodynamics. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Stated differently, an isolated system will always tend to disorder. Living organisms are often mistakenly believed to defy the Second Law because they are able to increase their level of organization. To correct this misinterpretation, one must refer simply to the definition of [[thermodynamic system|systems]] and [[boundary (thermodynamic)|boundaries]]. A living organism is an open system, able to exchange both matter and energy with its environment. For example, a human being takes in food, breaks it down into its components, and then uses those to build up cells, tissues, ligaments, etc. This process increases order in the body, and thus decreases entropy. However, humans also 1) conduct heat to clothing and other objects they are in contact with, 2) generate convection due to differences in body temperature and the environment, 3) radiate heat into space, 4) consume energy-containing substances (i.e., food), and 5) eliminate waste (e.g., carbon dioxide, water, and other components of breath, urine, feces, sweat, etc.). When taking all these processes into account, the total entropy of the greater system (i.e., the human and her/his environment) increases. When the human ceases to live, none of these processes (1-5) take place, and any interruption in the processes (esp. 4 or 5) will quickly lead to morbidity and/or mortality.

=== Gibbs Free Energy ===
In biological systems, in general energy and entropy change together. Therefore, it is necessary to be able to define a state function that accounts for these changes simultaneously. This state function is the Gibbs Free Energy, ''G''.

:''G'' = ''H'' − ''TS''

where: 
* ''H'' is the [[enthalpy]] (SI unit: joule)
* ''T'' is the [[temperature]] (SI unit: [[kelvin]])
* ''S'' is the [[entropy]] (SI unit: joule per kelvin)
The change in Gibbs Free Energy can be used to determine whether a given chemical reaction can occur spontaneously. If ∆''G'' is negative, the reaction can occur [[spontaneous process|spontaneously]]. Likewise, if ∆''G'' is positive, the reaction is nonspontaneous.&lt;ref&gt;Bergethon, P. R. The Physical Basis of Biochemistry: The Foundations of Molecular Biophysics. New York: Springer, 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical reactions can be “coupled” together if they share intermediates. In this case, the overall Gibbs Free Energy change is simply the sum of the ∆''G'' values for each reaction. Therefore, an unfavorable reaction (positive ∆''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) can be driven by a second, highly favorable reaction (negative ∆''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; where the magnitude of ∆''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; magnitude of ∆''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). For example, the reaction of glucose with fructose to form sucrose has a ∆''G'' value of +5.5 kcal/mole. Therefore, this reaction will not occur spontaneously. The breakdown of ATP to form ADP and inorganic phosphate has a ∆''G'' value of -7.3 kcal/mole. These two reactions can be coupled together, so that glucose binds with ATP to form glucose-1-phosphate and ADP. The glucose-1-phosphate is then able to bond with fructose yielding sucrose and inorganic phosphate. The ∆''G'' value of the coupled reaction is -1.8 kcal/mole, indicating that the reaction will occur spontaneously. This principle of coupling reactions to alter the change in Gibbs Free Energy is the basic principle behind all enzymatic action in biological organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Alberts, Bruce. Essential Cell Biology. New York: Garland Science, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biological exponential growth''' is the exponential growth of biological organisms. When the resources availability is unlimited in the [[habitat]], the [[population]] of an [[organism]] living in the habitat grows in an [[Exponential growth|exponential]] or geometric fashion. Population growth in which the number of individuals increase by a constant multiple in each generation. The potential for population growth can be demonstrated in the laboratory under conditions that provide abundant resources and space. For example, a few fruit flies in a large culture jar containing an abundant food source may reproduce rapidly. One female fruit fly may lay more than 50 eggs. Reproductive adults develop in about 14 days, with approximately equal numbers of male and female offspring. For each female that began the population, 50 flies are expected 2 weeks later. Each female in the second generation produces 50 more flies after 2 more weeks, and so on. In other words, the population is experiencing exponential growth.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Miller and Stephen B. Harley zoology 4th edition&lt;/ref&gt; Slow exponential growth is when a population grows slowly yet exponential because the population has long live spans. While a rapid exponential growth refers to a population that grows ( and dies ) rapidly because the population has short life spans.

Resource availability is obviously essential for the unimpeded growth of a population. Ideally, when resources in the habitat are unlimited, each species has the ability to realise fully its innate potential to grow in number, as [[Charles Darwin]] observed while developing his theory of [[natural selection]].

If, in a hypothetical population of size ''N'', the birth rates (per capita) are represented as ''b'' and death rates (per capita) as ''d'', then the increase or decrease in ''N'' during a time period ''t'' will be:

&lt;math&gt;dN/dt=(b-d)N&lt;/math&gt;

(b-d) is called the 'intrinsic rate of natural increase' and is a very important parameter chosen for assessing the impacts of any biotic or [[Abiotic components|abiotic factor]] on population growth.

Any species growing exponentially under unlimited resource conditions can reach enormous [[Population density|population densities]] in a short time. Darwin showed how even a slow growing animal like the [[elephant]] could reach an enormous population if there were unlimited resources for its growth in its habitat.

'''High throughput cell biology''' is the use of automation equipment with classical [[cell biology]] techniques to address biological questions that are  otherwise unattainable using conventional methods. It may incorporate techniques from [[optics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]] or [[image analysis]] to permit rapid, highly parallel research into how cells function, interact with each other and how [[pathogen]]s exploit them in disease.

High-throughput biology serves as one facet of what has also been called "[[omics]] research" - the interface between large scale biology ([[genome]], [[proteome]], [[transcriptome]]), technology and researchers. High throughput cell biology has a definite focus on the cell, and methods accessing the cell such as imaging, gene expression [[microarrays]], or [[Genome-wide association study|genome wide screening]]. The basic idea is to take methods normally performed on their own and do a very large number of them without impacting their quality.

High throughput research can be defined as the automation of experiments such that large scale repetition becomes feasible. This is important because many of the questions faced by life science researchers now involve large numbers. For example, the Human Genome contains at least 21,000 genes,&lt;ref name="urlHow Many Genes Are There?"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/faq/genenumber.shtml | title = How Many Genes Are There? | date = 2008-09-19 | work = Human Genome Project Information | publisher = U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science }}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which can potentially contribute to cell function, or disease. To be able to capture an idea of how these genes interact with one another, which genes are involved in and where they are, methods that encompass from the cell to the genome are of interest.

== Use of robotics ==
Classical [[High throughput screening]] robotics are now being tied closer to cell biology, principally using technologies such as [[High-content screening]]. High throughput cell biology dictates methods that can take routine cell biology from low scale research to the speed and scale necessary to investigate complex systems, achieve high sample size, or efficiently screen through a collection.

== Use of microscopy and cytometry ==

High-content screening technology is mainly based on automated digital [[microscopy]] and flow [[cytometry]], in combination with IT-systems for the analysis and storage of the data.
"High-content" or visual biology technology has two purposes, first to acquire spatially or temporally resolved information on an event and second to automatically quantify it. Spatially resolved instruments are typically automated [[microscopes]], and temporal resolution still requires some form of fluorescence measurement in most cases.This means that a lot of HCS instruments are ([[fluorescence]]) microscopes that are connected to some form of image analysis package. These take care of all the steps in taking fluorescent images of cells and provide rapid, automated and unbiased assessment of experiments.

== Development of technology ==

The technology can be defined as being at the same development point as the first automated [[DNA sequencer]]s in the early 1990s. Automated [[DNA sequencing]] was a [[disruptive technology]] when it became practical and -even if early devices had shortcomings- it enabled genome scale sequencing projects and created the field of bioinformatics. The impact of a similarly disruptive and powerful technology on molecular cell biology and translational research is hard to predict but what is clear is that it will cause a profound change in the way cell biologists research and medicines are discovered.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14917">'''Potassium spatial buffering''' is a mechanism for the regulation of extracellular [[potassium]] concentration by [[astrocyte]]s. Other mechanisms for astrocytic potassium clearance are carrier-operated or channel-operated potassium chloride uptake.&lt;ref&gt;Walz W (2000): Role of astrocytes in the clearance of excess extracellular potassium. Neurochemistry International&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[repolarization]] of [[neuron]]s tends to raise potassium concentration in the extracellular fluid.  If a significant rise occurs, it will interfere with neuronal signaling by depolarizing neurons. Astrocytes have large numbers of potassium ion channels facilitating removal of potassium ions from the extracellular fluid. They are taken up at one region of the astrocyte and then distributed throughout the [[cytoplasm]] of the cell, and further to its neighbors via [[gap junction]]s. This keeps extracellular potassium at levels that prevent interference with normal propagation of an [[action potential]].

==Potassium spatial buffering==
Glial cells, once believed to have a passive role in CNS, are active regulators of numerous functions in the brain, including clearance of the neurotransmitter from the synapses, guidance during neuronal migration, control of neuronal synaptic transmission, and maintaining ideal ionic environment for active communications between neurons in central nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;Kozoriz, M. G., D. C. Bates, et al. (2006). "Passing potassium with and without gap junctions." Journal of Neuroscience 26(31): 8023-8024.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neurons are surrounded by extracellular fluid rich in sodium ions and poor in potassium ions. The concentrations of these ions are reversed inside the cells. Due to the difference in concentration, there is a chemical gradient across the cell membrane, which leads to sodium influx and potassium efflux. When the action potential takes place, a considerable change in extracellular potassium concentration occurs due to the limited volume of the CNS extracellular space. The change in potassium concentration in the extracellular space impacts a variety of neuronal processes, such as maintenance of membrane potential, activation and inactivation of voltage gated channels, synaptic transmission, and electrogenic transport of neurotransmitter. Change of extracellular potassium concentration of from 3mM can affect neural activity. Therefore, there are diverse cellular mechanisms for tight control of potassium ions, the most widely accepted mechanisms being K+ spatial buffering mechanism. Orkand and his colleagues who first theorized spatial buffering stated “if a Glial cell becomes depolarized by K+ that has accumulated in the clefts, the resulting current carries K+ inward in the high [K+] region and out again, through electrically coupled Glial cells in low [K+] regions” 
In the model presented by Orkand and his colleagues, glial cells intake and traverse potassium ions from region of high concentrations to region of low concentration maintaining potassium concentration to be low in extracellular space. Glial cells are well suited for transportation of potassium ions since it has unusually high permeability to potassium ions and traverse long distance by its elongated shape or by being coupled to one another.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, K. C. and C. Nicholson (2000). "Spatial buffering of potassium ions in brain extracellular space." Biophysical Journal 78(6): 2776-2797.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xiong, Z. Q. and F. L. Stringer (2000). "Sodium pump activity, not glial spatial buffering, clears potassium after epileptiform activity induced in the dentate gyrus." Journal of Neurophysiology 83(3): 1443-1451.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potassium regulatory mechanisms===
Potassium buffering can be broadly categorized into two categories: Potassium uptake and Potassium spatial buffering. For potassium uptake, excess potassium ions are temporarily taken into glial cells through transporters, or potassium channels. In order to preserve electroneutrality, potassium influxes into glial cells are accompanied by influx of chlorine or efflux of sodium. It is expected that when potassium accumulates within glial cells, water influx and swelling occurs. For potassium spatial buffering, functionally coupled glial cells with high potassium permeability transfer potassium ions from regions of elevated potassium concentration to regions of lower potassium concentration. The potassium current is driven by the difference in glial syncytium membrane potential and local potassium equilibrium potential. When one region of potassium concentration increases, there is a net driving force causing potassium to flow into the glial cells. The entry of potassium causes a local depolarization that propagates electrotonically through the glial cell network which causes net driving force of potassium out of the glial cells. This process causes dispersion of local potassium with little net gain of potassium ions within the glial cells, which in turn prevents swelling. Glial cell depolarization caused by neuronal activity releases potassium onto blood stream, which was once widely hypothesized to be cause of vessel relaxation, was found to have little affect on neurovascular coupling.&lt;ref&gt;Metea, M. R., P. Kofuji, et al. (2007). "Neurovascular coupling is not mediated by potassium siphoning from glial cells." Journal of Neuroscience 27(10): 2468-2471.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the efficiency of potassium spatial buffering mechanisms, in certain regions of CNS, potassium buffering seems more dependent on active uptake mechanisms rather than spatial buffering. Therefore, the exact role of glial potassium spatial buffering in the various regions of our brain still remains uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Kofuji, P. and E. A. Newman (2004). "Potassium buffering in the central nervous system." Neuroscience 129(4): 1045-1056. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kir channel===
The high permeability of glial cell membranes to potassium ions is a result of expression of high densities of potassium-selective channels with high open-probability at [[resting potential| resting membrane potentials]]. Kir channels, [[inward-rectifier potassium ion channel| potassium inward-rectifying channels]], allow passage of potassium ions inward much more readily than outward. They also display a variable conductance that positively correlates with extracellular potassium concentration: the higher the potassium concentration outside the cell, the higher the conductance. 

Kir channels are categorized into seven major subfamilies, Kir1 to Kir7, with a variety of gating mechanisms. Kir3 and Kir6 are primarily activated by intracellular [[G-protein]]s. Because they have a relatively low open-probability compared to the other families, they have little impact on potassium buffering. Kir1 and Kir7 are mainly expressed in [[epithelial cell]]s, such as those in kidney, choroid plexus, or retinal pigment epithelium, and have no impact on spatial buffering. Kir2, however, are expressed in brain neurons and glial cells. Kir4 and Kir5 are, along with Kir2, located in [[Muller glia]] and play important roles in potassium siphoning. There are some discrepancies among studies on expression of these channels in the stated locations.&lt;ref&gt;Kofuji, P. and N. C. Connors (2003). "Molecular substrates of potassium spatial buffering in glial cells." Molecular Neurobiology 28(2): 195-208.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solessio, E., K. Rapp, et al. (2001). "Spermine mediates inward rectification in potassium channels of turtle retinal Muller cells." Journal of Neurophysiology 85(4): 1357-1367.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Panglial syncytium===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Panglial Syncytium.jpg|thumbnail|right]] --&gt;
The panglial syncytium is a large network of interconnected glial cells, which are extensively linked by gap junctions. The panglial syncytium spreads through central nervous system where it provides metabolic and osmotic support, as well as ionic regulation of myelinated axons in white matter tracts. The three types of macroglial cells within network of panglial syncytium are [[astrocytes]], [[oligodendrocytes]], and ependymocytes. Originally it was believed that there was homologous gap junction between oligodendrocytes. It was later found through untrastructural analysis that gap junctions do not directly link adjacent oligodendrocytes, rather it gap junctions with adjacent astrocytes, providing secondary pathway to nearby oligodendrocytes. With direct gap junction between myelin sheaths to surrounding astrocytes, excess potassium and osmotic water directly enters astrocyte syncytium, where it downstream to astrocyte endfeet at capillaries and the [[glia limitans]].

==Potassium siphoning==

Potassium spatial buffering that occurs in the retina is called potassium siphoning, where the [[Muller cell]] is the principal glial cell type. Muller cells have important role in retinal physiology. It maintains retinal cell metabolism and are critical in maintaining potassium homeostasis in extracellular space during neuronal activity. Like cells responsible for spatial buffering, Muller cells are distinctively permeable to potassium ions through Kir channels. Like other glial cells, the high selectivity of Muller cell membranes to potassium ions is due to the high density of Kir channels. Potassium conductance is unevenly distributed in Muller cells.&lt;ref&gt;Brew, H. and D. Attwell (1985). "Is the Potassium Channel Distribution in Glial-Cells Optimal for Spatial Buffering of Potassium." Biophysical Journal 48(5): 843-847.&lt;/ref&gt; By focally increasing potassium ions along amphibian Muller cells and recording the resulting depolarization, the observed potassium conductance was concentrated in the endfoot process of 94% of the total potassium conductance localized to the small subcellular domain. The observation lead to hypothesis that excess potassium in extracellular space is “siphoned” by the Muller cells to the vitreous humor. Potassium siphoning is a specialized form of spatial buffering mechanisms where large reservoir of potassium ions is emptied into vitreous humor. Similar distribution pattern of Kir channels could be found in amphibians.&lt;ref&gt;Karwoski, C. J., H. K. Lu, et al. (1989). "Spatial Buffering of Light-Evoked Potassium Increases by Retinal Muller (Glial) Cells." Science 244(4904): 578-580.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newman, E. A., D. A. Frambach, et al. (1984). "Control of Extracellular Potassium Levels by Retinal Glial-Cell K+ Siphoning." Science 225(4667): 1174-1175.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winter, M., W. Eberhardt, et al. (2000). "Failure of potassium siphoning by Muller cells: A new hypothesis of perfluorocarbon liquid-induced retinopathy." Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science 41(1): 256-261.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Existence of potassium siphoning was first reported in 1966 study by Orkand et al. In the study, optic nerve of [[Necturus]] was dissected to document the long-distance movement of potassium after the nerve stimulation. Following the low frequency stimulation of .5&amp;nbsp;Hz at the retinal end of the dissected optic nerve, depolarization 1-2mV was measured at astrocytes at the opposite end of the nerve bundle, which was up to several millimeters from the electrode. With higher frequency stimulation, higher plateau of depolarization was observed. Therefore, they hypothesized that the potassium released to extracellular compartment during axonal activity entered and depolarized nearby astrocytes, where it was transported away by unfamiliar mechanism, which caused depolarization on astrocytes distant from site of stimulation. The proposed model was actually inappropriate since at the time neither gap junctions nor syncytium among glial cells were known, and optic nerve of Necturus are unmyelinated, which means that potassium efflux occurred directly into the periaxonal extracellular space, where potassium ions in extracellular space would be directly absorbed into the abundant astrocytes around axons.&lt;ref&gt;Kofuji, P. and E. A. Newman (2004). "Potassium buffering in the central nervous system." Neuroscience 129(4): 1045-1056.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diseases==
In patients with [[Tuberous Sclerosis Complex]] (TSC), abnormalities occur in astrocyte, which leads to pathogenesis of neurological dysfunction in this disease. TSC is a multisystem genetic disease with mutation in either [[TSC1]] or [[TSC2]] gene. It results in disabling neurological symptoms such as mental retardation, autism, and seizures. Glial cells have important physiological roles of regulating neuronal excitability and preventing epilepsy. Astrocytes maintain homeostasis of excitatory substances, such as extracellular potassium, by immediate uptake through specific [[potassium channels]] and sodium potassium pumps. It is also regulated by potassium spatial buffering via astrocyte networks where astrocytes are coupled through gap junctions. Mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 gene often results in decreased expression of the astrocytic connexin protein, [[Cx43]].&lt;ref&gt;Xu, L., L. H. Zeng, et al. (2009). "Impaired astrocytic gap junction coupling and potassium buffering in a mouse model of tuberous sclerosis complex." Neurobiology of Disease 34(2): 291-299.&lt;/ref&gt; With impairment in gap junction coupling between astrocytes, myriad of abnormalities in potassium buffering occurs which results in increased extracellular potassium concentration and may predispose to neuronal hyperexcitability and seizures. According to a study done on animal model, connexin43-deficient mice showed decreased threshold for the generation of epileptiform events. The study also demonstrated role of gap junction in accelerating potassium clearance, limiting potassium accumulation during neuronal firing, and relocating potassium concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;Wallraff, A., R. Kohling, et al. (2006). "The impact of astrocytic gap junctional coupling on potassium buffering in the hippocampus." Journal of Neuroscience 26(20): 5438-5447.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demyelinating Diseases of the central nervous system, such as Neuromyelitis Optica, often leads to molecular components of the panglial syncytium being compromised, which leads to blocking of potassium spatial buffering. Without mechanism of potassium buffering, potassium induced osmotic swelling of myelin occurs where myelins are destroyed and axonal salutatory conduction ceases.&lt;ref&gt;Rash, J. E. (2010). "Molecular Disruptions of the Panglial Syncytium Block Potassium Siphoning and Axonal Saltatory Conduction: Pertinence to Neuromyelitis Optica and Other Demyelinating Diseases of the Central Nervous System." Neuroscience 168(4): 982-1008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radioactivity''' is generally used in life sciences for highly sensitive and direct measurements of biological phenomena, and for visualizing the location of [[biomolecule]]s [[radiolabelled]] with a [[radioisotope]].

All atoms exist as stable or unstable [[isotope]]s and the latter decay at a given [[half-life]] ranging from attoseconds to billions of years; radioisotopes useful to biological and experimental systems have half-lives ranging from minutes to months.  In the case of the hydrogen isotope [[tritium]] (half-life = 12.3 years) and [[carbon-14]] (half-life = 5,730 years), these isotopes derive their importance from all organic life containing hydrogen and carbon and therefore can be used to study countless living processes, reactions, and phenomena.  Most short lived isotopes are produced in [[cyclotron]]s, linear [[particle accelerator]]s, or [[nuclear reactor]]s and their relatively short half-lives give them high maximum theoretical specific activities which is useful for detection in biological systems.

[[Isotopic labeling|Radiolabeling]] is a technique used to track the passage of a molecule that incorporates a radioisotope through a reaction, metabolic pathway, cell, tissue, organism, or biological system. The reactant is 'labeled' by replacing specific atoms by their isotope.  Replacing an atom with its own radioisotope is an [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|intrinsic]] label that does not alter the structure of the molecule.  Alternatively, molecules can be radiolabeled by chemical reactions that introduce an atom, [[Moiety (chemistry)|moiety]], or [[functional group]] that contains a [[radionuclide]].  For example, radio-iodination of peptides and proteins with [[Isotopes of iodine#Radioiodines I-123.2C I-124.2C I-125.2C and I-131 in medicine and biology|biologically useful iodine isotopes]] is easily done by an oxidation reaction that replaces the hydroxyl group with iodine on [[tyrosine]] and [[histadine]] residues.  Another example is to use chelators such [[DOTA (chelator)|DOTA]] that can be chemically coupled to a protein; the chelator in turn traps radiometals thus radiolabeling the protein.  This has been used for introducing Yttrium-90 onto a monoclonal antibody for therapeutic purposes and for introducing Gallium-68 onto the peptide [[Octreotide]] for diagnostic imaging by [[Positron emission tomography|PET imaging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Breeman | first1 = W. A. P. | last2 = De Blois | first2 = E. | last3 = Sze Chan | first3 = H. | last4 = Konijnenberg | first4 = M. | last5 = Kwekkeboom | first5 = D. J. | last6 = Krenning | first6 = E.

Radiolabeling is not necessary for some applications.  For some purposes,  soluble ionic salts can be used directly without further modification (e.g., [[gallium-67]], [[gallium-68]], and [[radioiodine]] isotopes).  These uses rely on the chemical and biological properties of the radioisotope itself, to localize it within the organism or biological system.

[[Molecular imaging]] is the biomedical field that employs radiotracers to visualize and quantify biological processes using [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) and [[single-photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT) imaging.  Again, a key feature of using radioactivity in life science applications is that it is a quantitative technique, so PET/SPECT not only reveals where a radiolableled molecule is but how much is there.

[[Radiobiology]] (also known as radiation biology) is a field of clinical and basic medical sciences that involves the study of the action of radioactivity on biological systems.  The controlled action of deleterious radioactivity on living systems is the basis of [[radiation therapy]].

==Examples of biologically useful radionuclei==
===Hydrogen===
[[Tritium]] (Hydrogen-3) is a very low [[Beta decay|beta]] energy emitter that can be used to label [[protein]]s, [[nucleic acid]]s, drugs and almost any organic biomolecule. The maximum theoretical specific activity of tritium is 28.8 [[Curie|Ci]]/[[Mole (unit)|mmol]] (1.066 PBq/mol).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voges|first1=Rolf|last2=Heys|first2=J. Richard|last3=Moenius|first3=Thomas|title=Preparation of compounds labeled with tritium and carbon-14|date=2009|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester, U.K.|isbn=978-0-470-51607-2|page=146|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_VgcIEhrwCIC&amp;pg=PA146|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is often more than one tritium atom per molecule: for example, tritiated [[Uridine triphosphate|UTP]] is sold by most suppliers with carbons 5 and 6 each bonded to a tritium atom.

For tritium detection, liquid [[scintillation counter]]s have been classically employed, in which the energy of a tritium decay is transferred to a [[Scintillator|scintillant]] molecule in solution which in turn gives off photons whose intensity and spectrum can be measured by a [[photomultiplier]] array.  The efficiency of this process is 4–50%, depending on the scintillation cocktail used.

===Carbon===
[[Carbon-14]] has a long half-life of 5,730±40 years. Its maximum specific activity is 0.0624 Ci/mmol (2.31 TBq/mol). It is used in applications such as [[radiometric dating]] or drug tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.aptochem.com/t-radiolabeled-test-articles.aspx | title=Radiolabeled Test Articles | accessdate= | publisher=AptoChem }}&lt;/ref&gt;  C-14 labeling is common in drug development to do [[ADME]] (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) studies in animal models and in human toxicology and clinical trials.  Since tritium exchange may occur in some radiolabeled compounds, this does not happen with C-14 and may thus be preferred.

===Sodium===
[[Sodium-22]] and [[chlorine-36]] are commonly used to study [[ion transporter]]s. However, sodium-22 is hard to screen off and chlorine-36, with a half-life of 300,000 years, has low activity.&lt;ref&gt;''Biochemic methods. Sample for medicine Students''. 2nd ed 2008, by Birgitte Lüttge. Aarhus University.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sulfur===
[[Sulfur-35]] is used to label proteins and nucleic acids. [[Cysteine]] is an [[amino acid]] containing a [[thiol group]] which can be labeled by S-35. For [[nucleotide]]s that do not contain a sulfur group, the oxygen on one of the phosphate groups can be substituted with a sulfur. This [[thiophosphate]] acts the same as a normal phosphate group, although there is a slight bias against it by most [[polymerase]]s. The maximum theoretical specific activity is 1,494 Ci/mmol (55.28 PBq/mol).

===Phosphorus===
[[Phosphorus-33]] is used to label nucleotides. It is less energetic than P-32 and does not require protection with plexi glass. A disadvantage is its higher cost compared to P-32, as most of the bombarded P-31 will have acquired only one [[neutron]], while only some will have acquired two or more. Its maximum specific activity is 5,118 Ci/mmol (189.4 PBq/mol).

[[Phosphorus-32]] is widely used for labeling nucleic acids and phosphoproteins. It has the highest emission energy (1.7 MeV) of all common research radioisotopes. This is a major advantage in experiments for which sensitivity is a primary consideration, such as titrations of very strong interactions (i.e., very low dissociation constant), footprinting experiments, and detection of low-abundance phosphorylated species. 32P is also relatively inexpensive. Because of its high energy, however, its safe use requires a number of [[engineering controls]] (e.g., [[acrylic glass]]) and [[administrative controls]].  The half-life of 32P is 14.2 days, and its maximum specific activity is 9131 Ci/mmol.

===Iodine===
[[Iodine-125]] is commonly used for labeling proteins, usually at tyrosine residues. Unbound iodine is volatile and must be handled in a fume hood.  Its maximum specific activity is 2,176 Ci/mmol (80.51 PBq/mol).

A good example of the difference in energy of the various radionuclei is the detection window ranges used to detect them, which are generally proportional to the energy of the emission, but vary from machine to machine: in a Perkin elmer TriLux Beta scintillation counter &lt;!-- Googled to see where the hell did the values come from)--&gt;, the H-3 energy range window is between channel 5–360; C-14, S-35 and P-33 are in the window of 361–660; and P-32 is in the window of 661–1024.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

== Detection==
[[File:Autoradiography_of_a_brain_slice_from_an_embryonal_rat_-_PMID19190758_PLoS_0004371.png|thumb|Autoradiograph of a coronal brain tissue slice, with a radiolabeled GAD67 probe.  Most intense signal is seen in subventricular zone.]]
[[File:Southern-Blot-Autoradiogramm.jpg|thumb|Autoradiograph of Southern blot membrane]]

===Quantitative===
In [[liquid scintillation counting]], a small aliquot, filter or swab is added to scintillation fluid and the plate or vial is placed in a [[scintillation counter]] to measure the radioactive emissions.  Manufacturers have incorporated solid scintillants into multi-well plates to eliminate the need for scintillation fluid and make this into a high-throughput technique.

A [[gamma counter]] is similar in format to scintillation counting but it detects gamma emissions directly and does not require a scintillant.

A [[Geiger counter]] is a quick and rough approximation of activity. Lower energy emitters such as tritium can not be detected.

===Qualitative AND Quantitative===
[[Autoradiography]]: A tissue section affixed to a microscope slide or a membrane such as a [[Northern blot]] or a hybridized [[slot blot]] can be placed against x-ray film or phosphor screens to acquire a photographic or digital image.  The density of exposure, if calibrated, can supply exacting quantitative information.

[[Phosphor storage screen]]: The slide or membrane is placed against a phosphor screen which is then scanned in a [[phosphorimager]]. This is many times faster than film/emulsion techniques and outputs data in a digital form, thus it has largely replaced film/emulsion techniques.

===Microscopy===
[[Electron microscopy]]: The sample is not exposed to a beam of electrons but detectors picks up the expelled electrons from the radionuclei.

Micro-autoradiography: A tissue section, typically cryosectioned, is placed against a phosphor screen as above.

Quantitative Whole Body Autoradiography (QWBA):  Larger than micro-autoradiography, whole animals, typically rodents, can be analyzed for biodistribution studies.

[[Schild regression]] is a radioligand binding assay. It is used for DNA labelling (5' and 3'), leaving the nucleic acids intact.

==Radioactivity concentration==
A vial of radiolabel has a "total activity". Taking as an example γ32P [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], from the catalogues of the two major suppliers, Perkin Elmer NEG502H500UC or GE AA0068-500UCI, in this case, the total activity is 500 μCi (other typical numbers are 250 μCi or 1 mCi). This is contained in a certain volume, depending on the radioactive concentration, such as 5 to 10 mCi/mL (185 to 370 TBq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;); typical volumes include 50 or 25 μL.

Not all molecules in the solution have a P-32 on the last (i.e., gamma) phosphate: the "specific activity" gives the radioactivity concentration and depends on the radionuclei's half-life. If every molecule were labelled, the maximum theoretical specific activity is obtained that for P-32 is 9131 Ci/mmol. Due to pre-calibration and efficiency issues this number is never seen on a label; the values often found are 800, 3000 and 6000 Ci/mmol. With this number it is possible to calculate the total chemical concentration and the hot-to-cold ratio.

"Calibration date" is the date in which the vial’s activity is the same as on the label. "Pre-calibration" is when the activity is calibrated in a future date to compensate for the decay occurred during shipping.

==Comparison with fluorescence==
{{See also|Fluorescence in the life sciences}}
Prior to the widespread use of [[Fluorescence in the life sciences|fluorescence]] in the past three decades radioactivity was the most common label.

The primary advantage of fluorescence over radiotracers is that it does not require radiological controls and their associated expenses and safety measures.  The decay of radioisotopes may limit the [[shelf life]] of a reagent, requiring its replacement and thus increasing expenses.  Several fluorescent molecules can be used simultaneously (given that they do not overlap, cf. FRET), whereas with radioactivity two [[isotopes]] can be used ([[tritium]] and a low energy isotope, e.g. [[Phosphorus-33|&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;P]] due to different intensities) but require special equipment (a tritium screen and a regular phosphor-imaging screen, a specific dual channel detector, e.g.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20090105194225/http://www.biospacelab.com/html/microimager.html]).

Fluorescence is not necessary easier or more convenient to use because fluorescence requires specialized equipment of its own and because [[Quenching (fluorescence)|quenching]] makes absolute and/or reproducible quantification difficult.

The primary disadvantage of fluorescence versus radiotracers is a significant biological problem:  chemically tagging a molecule with a fluorescent dye radically changes the structure of the molecule, which in turn can radically change the way that molecule interacts with other molecules.  In contrast, intrinsic radiolabeling of a molecule can be done without altering its structure in any way.  For example, substituting a H-3 for a hydrogen atom or C-14 for a carbon atom does not change the conformation, structure, or any other property of the molecule, it's just switching forms of the same atom.  Thus an intrinscially radiolabeled molecule is identical to its unlabeled counterpart.

Measurement of biological phenomona by radiotracers is always direct.  In contrast, many life science fluorescence applications are indirect, consisting of a fluorescent dye increasing, decreasing, or shifting in wavelength emission upon binding to the molecule of interest.

==Safety==
If good [[health physics]] controls are maintained in a laboratory where radionuclides are used, it is unlikely that the overall radiation dose received by workers will be of much significance. Nevertheless, the effects of low doses are mostly unknown so many regulations exist to avoid unnecessary risks, such as skin or internal exposure. Due to the low penetration power and many variables involved it is hard to convert a radioactive concentration to a dose.
1 μCi of P-32 on a square centimetre of skin (through a dead layer of a thickness of 70 μm) gives 7961 [[Rad (unit)|rads]] (79.61 [[gray (unit)|grays]]) per hour . Similarly a [[mammogram]] gives an exposure of 300 [[Röntgen equivalent man|mrem]] (3 [[millisievert|mSv]]) on a larger volume (in the US, the average annual dose is 620 mrem or 6.2 mSv&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=NCRP|volume=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; ).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26686">'''Gender typing''' is the process by which a child becomes aware of their [[gender]] and thus behaves accordingly by adopting values and attributes of members of the sex that they identify as their own.&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer, D. R. (2009). Social and personality development (6th ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth&lt;/ref&gt; This process is extremely important for a child's social and personality development because it largely impacts the child's understanding of expected social behaviour and influences social judgments.

==Gender identity==
Given the definition, once the child is aware of their gender they will start to behave in [[gender roles]] that their same-sex models would normally adopt. Therefore, these individual responses become internalized and function according to the appropriate gender-role standards.&lt;ref&gt;Pentony, C.G. (1980). Gender, sex typing, and gender identity. 941–942.&lt;/ref&gt; The responses that individuals receive from their social group will mold their identity – becoming more feminine or masculine – and thus affect the way they view the world. Other facets of the process can also result in atypical development. Albeit, whether a child develops shared traits, cross-gender identities, or [[androgyny]], their decision begins with the identification of a gender and the models he or she chooses to emulate. The behaviors they adopt will ultimately shape their knowledge and identity for who they are and how they should behave.

==Theories==

===Freud’s [[psychoanalytic theory]]===
[[Sigmund Freud]] believed that as a child progresses through each of the different stages in [[psychosexual development]], during the third year of the child's life, genitals are thought to become active. As children develop a greater understanding of their own sex they also develop either a [[castration complex]] (in boys) or [[penis envy]] (in girls). For boys, during the “phallic” stage, they are at the height of childhood sexuality. During this the [[Oedipus complex]] occurs, where the boy feels erotic love for his mother ([[Electra complex]] in girls where love is directed towards the father). As time progresses and the boy matures, he is slowly able to let go of the rival feelings he has towards his father and free himself from his love for his parents. At this time, the boy learns to emulate masculine attributes from his father and subsequently to identify with him.&lt;ref name="Mullahy"&gt;Mullahy. P. (1948). ''Oedipus myth and complex: A Review of Psychoanalytic Theory''. New York, NY: Grove Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
The girl's development, Freud argued, is more complicated. Generally, as with males, the first object of interest is also the mother figure and for the first four years and beyond a girl remains attached to her mother. However, when the female child learns about “[[castration]]” it sparks disappointment and she blames her mother for her lack of a penis. Because of this, the girl gives up masturbation and in turn shifts focus from her mother to her father. By abandoning [[masturbation]] the girl can no longer be active, thus displaying a passive nature. The father then assists her by smoothly transitioning her towards a more feminine path. Furthermore, the girl's affection towards her father will also influence her to emulate her mother's feminine qualities and eventually adopt more gender-typed behaviours.&lt;ref name="Mullahy"/&gt;

===Kohlberg’s cognitive-developmental theory===
The cognitive-developmental theory is also closely linked to [[Jean Piaget]]’s analysis for the age-related cognitive changes a child goes through. [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] suggested that cognition comes before action and behavior (“I am a boy so I do boy-like things”). This emphasizes the importance of a child's understanding about [[gender roles]] and their permanent placement in it. After a child can fully grasp this concept, gender-specific information will become more relevant. This idea of gender consistency, similar to Piaget's concrete-operational stage, is represented by three stages:
# gender identity: the child recognizes that they are either a boy or a girl and possesses the ability to label others.
# gender stability: the identity in which they recognizes themselves as does not change
# gender consistency: the acceptance that gender does not change regardless of changes in gender-typed appearance, activities, and traits.

When the child is able to fully grasp gender stable understanding about themselves, usually between the ages of five and seven, the motivation to master their orientation and to socialize themselves allows them to seek out same-sexed models to learn more about gender-stereotypic behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, C. L., Ruble, D. N., &amp; Szkrykablo, J. (2002). Cognitive theories of early gender development. American psychological association. 4(23), 544–557.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bussey, K. (2011). Gender identity development. ''Handbook of Identity Theory and Research.'' 603-628.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender schema theory===
A [[schema (psychology)|schema]] is a cognitively organized network of associations that is readily available to help guide an individual's perception. Gender schema acts as a guide or standard for consistent behavior in a given scenario. Labels such as “girls are weak and boys are strong,” classifies what stereotypically acceptable actions for the gender groups are. Therefore, the theory proposes the idea that once the child has developed basic knowledge on gender behaviors they will begin to construct gender schemas. This is acquired first through the basic understanding of gender-specific roles. In other words, the child learns the contents of the society, things that are related to their own and the opposite sex, and incorporates it into their gender schemas. The child then learns to apply the appropriate attributes respectively to the right gender by selectively using this knowledge to conceptualize their own actions. Hence, categorizing how they should perform in various situations by molding their capabilities to match the schematic labels.&lt;ref&gt;Bem, S. L. (1981) Gender schema theory: a cognitive account of sex typing. ''Psychological Review.''88(4), 354–364.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social-learning theory ([[Albert Bandura]])===
Social learning theorists, like Albert Bandura, suggest that adults not only provide models for children to imitate, but that they also are actively involved in influencing a child's gender-role identification. The [[Social learning theory]] proposes that gender-identities and gender-role preferences are acquired through two concepts.

# Direct tuition (differential reinforcement): The first concept is represented through direct tuition, also known as differential reinforcement. Early in a child's development, parents are already encouraging gender-appropriate activities and discouraging cross-gender activities. Adults reward children when they display gender-appropriate behavior and punish children when they display cross-gender behavior. The idea of direct tuition expresses that gender-typed behavior begins with the child adopting views they learn from their parents. Therefore, parents reinforce the developmental of gender stereotypes by providing gender-appropriate toys and activities. Adults influence a child's gender identification when they encourage gender-typed behaviors like teaching “boys how to be boys and girls how to be girls”.&lt;ref name="Shaffer, D. R. 2009"&gt;Shaffer, D. R. (2009). ''Social and Personality Development (6th ed.)''. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Observational learning]]: The second concept is represented through observational learning in where children imitate and follow the behaviors of individuals who are of the same sex. Children become increasingly aware of gender stereotypes in preschool and acknowledge these “same-sex models” when they begin to exercise their preferences for “gender-typed” toys or activities. These same-sex models may include any individual from teachers and older siblings to media personalities.&lt;ref name="Shaffer, D. R. 2009"/&gt;

==Social models==
There are many opportunities for a child to learn and develop their own understanding of what “[[gender]]” is. Thus as children progresses from childhood into [[adolescence]] they will already have been exposed to many factors that will influence their ideas and attitudes for normative social behaviors regarding gender roles. Social models, such as parents, siblings, and the media become extremely important during different stages of the child's development.

'''Parents:'''
Parents play a vital part in a child's early life, for they are the first group of people that a child meets and learns from. The information that surrounds a child at home becomes reinforcements for desired behaviors of a male or female. Studies have shown that as immediate as 24 hours after a child is born most parents have already engaged in gender [[Stereotype|stereotypic]] expectations of sons or daughters. Through examples such as painting a room pink or blue, encouragement to participate in shared sex-typed activities, offering gender differentiated toys, or treating the opposite sex child differently, these parent-child interactions have long lasting influence on how a child connects to certain gender-specific behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Witt, S. D. (1997). Parental influence on children’s socialization to gender roles. ''Adolescence.'' 32(126). 253-259.&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, various evidence suggest that certain household differences affecting how a child is raised can influence how similar (or different) a child is to the opposite sex, therefore how “feminine” or “masculine” the child can potentially become. For instance, as certain research demonstrates, in the absence of a father figure boys are generally more “feminine” than those living with a father. This demonstrates the significance of father-son modeling. The same research reveals that boyhood femininity is more strongly correlated with parental reinforcement such as a father or mother's desire for a girl and/or their approval for feminine behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, C. W., Green, R. &amp; Williams, K., Goodman, M. (1987). Boyhood gender identity development: a statistical contrast of two family groups. ''Developmental Psychlology.'' 23(4), 544-557.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Siblings:'''
Apart from parents, children also seek reinforcement from their older siblings. Therefore, inconsistencies for gender behaviors can also be as a result of children emulating their siblings of opposite sex.
Sibling's influence is often most effective when the sibling is of an age that is more advanced than the child himself, therefore increasing the motivation for the child to model after their brother or sister. The impact of older siblings are power predictors for the younger sibling's gender role attitudes, sex-typed personality qualities, and masculine leisure activities. Findings suggest that girls develop less traditional attitudes than boys, thus, relative to stereotypically traditional development, older male siblings are more conscientious towards masculine activities, which are evidently modeled after by younger siblings more than feminine activities.&lt;ref name="McHale, S. M. 2001"&gt;McHale, S. M., Updegraff, K. A., Helms-Erikson, H. (2001). Sibling influences on gender development in middle childhood and early adolescence: a longitudinal study. ''Developmental Psychology.'' 37(1). 115-125.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, older brothers tend to have stronger influence over a younger sibling's sexual development. There is evidence that the relationship between older brother and younger sister can, in fact, influence the sister to become more feminine, abiding to more stereotypical gender-typed development than girls with older sisters.&lt;ref&gt;Kornreich, J. L., Hearn, K. D., Rodrigues, G. &amp; O’Sullivan, L. F. (2003). Sibling influence, gender roles, and the sexual socialization of urban early adolescent girls. ''The Journal of Sex Research.'' 40(1). 101-110.&lt;/ref&gt; Biological studies show that dizygotic twins with the opposite- sex co-twin gender show more sex-typed behaviors than same-sex twins.&lt;ref&gt;Mehta, C. M., Strough, J. (2010). Gender segregation and gender-typing in adolescence. ''Sex Role.''&lt;/ref&gt;
Conversely, this can also develop in an opposite direction in which children may try to diverge themselves from their siblings as much as possible, making their differences more salient; however, this may be more evident in first-borns possibly due to the birth order.&lt;ref name="McHale, S. M. 2001"/&gt;

'''Peers:'''
At a young age, children can already utilize their knowledge of different social categories to form stereotypes about what they understand about men and women. Interaction with peer groups will often shape people's behavior to fit normative expectations. Children often group together with other children of the same-gender. Belonging in a group that shares the same gender identity will often endorse more gender appropriate traits. An example of this is the fact that girls have more expressive traits than boys.&lt;ref&gt;Van Beijsterveldt, C. E. M., Hudziak, J. J., Boomsama, D. I. (2006). Genetic and environmental influences on cross-gender behavior to problems: a study of dutch twins at ages 7 and 10 years. ''Arch Sex. Behav.'' 648-658.&lt;/ref&gt; Research also show that children often engage in play with same-sex peers, and exclude others who are different from the norm. For example, children who want to join a group will only be allowed to engage in play if they are a same-gender peer who has had prior experience with the activity, or an opposite-gender peer who has not had prior experience.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, C. L. (1989). Children’s use of gender-related information in making social judgment. ''Developmental Psychology.'' 25(1), 80-88.&lt;/ref&gt; The desire to engage in play can influence a child to behave like to their peers. In later life, as children starts to move away from their parents, the role of friendship becomes much more influential.

'''Media:'''
Children learn about different gender categories by observing various forms of [[media (communication)|media]]. They often look for gender roles, with whom they can relate to, from books and television. Conversely, these sources of media will also stereotypically shape a child's understanding for gender acceptable behaviors. Studies examining the effects of gender stereotyping in children's literature describe that, most often than not, gender views are affiliated with stereotypes which are both culturally and individually constructed. In children's literature, male characters appear to be more central as well as less emotional and stronger. Female characters on the other hand worked out their feelings through expression, they are more dependent and usually adopt the roles of more domesticated characters.&lt;ref&gt;Turner-Bowker, D. M. (1996). Gender stereotyped descriptors in children’s picture books: does “curious Jane” exist in the literature? ''Sex Roles.'' 35(7/8), 461-488.&lt;/ref&gt;
Moreover, these characteristics are also seen in [[television]] programing. For example, in most prime-time television shows women receive twice as many comments about her appearance than men. Similarly, a study investigating the cartoon “[[Pokémon]]” and gender role expresses the differences in “good” and “bad” characters. Jesse and James (villains of the story) are portrayed to have adopted counter-stereotypical portrayal. While Jesse is seen as more aggressive and James as more feminine, it subtly teaches children that nontraditional or nonstereotypical gender role behaviors are bad. Furthermore, children in the story have difficultly recalling a male Pokémon revealing that there is an imbalance in which prominence is given to male characters.&lt;ref&gt;Ogletree, S. M., Martinez, C. N., Turner, T. R., Mason, B. (2004). Pokémon: exploring the role of gender. ''Sex Roles.'' 50(11/12), 851-859.&lt;/ref&gt;
These depictions of male and female character roles can potentially become unconsciously influential in the way a child constructs gender views.

==Atypical gender development and controversies==
It is expected for children to develop gender-typed behavioural cues given that children often use gender-related information to make judgments. Society often rewards shared traditional behaviours, especially for men, and thus having progressed to a cross-gender development can lead to unwanted criticisms and punishment. Therefore, when children undergo atypical gender development, due to both genetic and environmental contributors, it can drastically alter normal development from a person's sense of self-worth, self-esteem, to feelings of acceptance. When the child identifies as the opposite sex, he or she is then diagnosed with [[gender dysphoria]] (often termed ''gender identity disorder'' or GID).&lt;ref&gt;nafo, A., Iervolino, A. C., Plomin, R. (2005). Masculine girls and feminine boys: genetic and environmental contributions to atypical gender development in early childhood. ''Journal of Personality and Psychology.'' 88(2), 400-412.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Genetics vs. environmental contributors:'''
The development of gender roles has been associated with both [[genetics|genetic]] and [[social]] factors.
Current biological research has suggested that [[testosterone]] differences can affect sexual orientation, gender identity, and personality. For example, girls with increased prenatal testosterone levels, due to [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH), show more male-typed behaviors than the average female. This may cause a decrease in [[empathy]] levels, which is proven to be higher in the average women than men, and an increase in physical aggression, typically higher in men than women.&lt;ref&gt;Hines, M. (2011). Gender development and the human brain. ''Annual Review of Neuroscience''.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, multiple twin studies have also shown that [[homosexual]] traits displayed greater congruence in [[Monozygotic twins|monozygotic (MZ) twins]] than [[Dizygotic twins|dizygotic (DZ) twins]] displaying genetic contributions.&lt;ref&gt;Knafo, A., Iervolino, A. C., Plomin, R. (2005). Masculine girls and feminine boys: genetic and environmental contributions to atypical gender development in early childhood. ''Journal of Personality and Psychology.'' 88(2), 400-412.&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies reveal that this is especially true for girls' gender-typed values.&lt;ref name="Knafo, A. 2011"&gt;Knafo, A., Spinath, F. M. (2011). Genetic and environmental influences on girl’s and boy’s gender-typed and gender-neutral values. ''Developmental Psychology''. 47(3), 726-731.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, other studies have summarized that the prevalence of cross-gender behavior a highly heritable trait where MZ twins display the same cross-gender behaviors more so than DZ twins.&lt;ref name="Moller, B. 2009"&gt;Moller, B., Schreier, H., Li, A., Romer, G. (2009). Gender identity disorder in children and adolescents. ''Curr probl Pediatr Adolesc Health Care''. 117–143.&lt;/ref&gt;
While atypical gender role development may be heritable, this does not mean that it is independent. However, environmental effects can differ largely for different genders. Because society is more accepting of male traits (girls playing soccer) than female traits (boys doing ballet),{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} society's negativity typically forces males to try to stay within the stereotypic norms. That being said however, male influence accounted by environmental factors that lead to atypical development is also stronger for boys than girls in terms of atypical development.&lt;ref name="Knafo, A. 2011"/&gt;

'''Gender dysphoria:'''
[[Gender dysphoria]] or gender identity disorder (GID) occurs when the child identifies himself or herself as the opposite sex. GID, previously known as [[transsexualism]], occurs when a person has a strong desire to be the opposite sex because they feel uncomfortable in their own body. This may lead to cross-dressing or the desire to rid of their physical characteristic. GID is accompanied with a distress that the individual cannot change their sex and a strong rejection for sex-typical behaviours. Onset of most of these behaviors occurs as early as two to four years of age.&lt;ref name="Moller, B. 2009"/&gt;

'''Controversies about gender in [[DSM-5]]:'''
For the fifth edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' ([[DSM-5]]), there has been a tremendous amount{{Clarify|date=April 2013}} of debate around whether the sexual and gender identity, which includes the GID, qualifies as a [[mental disorder]]. One of the most notable discussions for this occurred in 2003 during the annual APA meeting, where Darryl B. Hill, Ph.D., argued that the GID should not be considered a mental disorder. He explains that due to the limited amount of reliable and valid evidence, given the role of parents and therapies, for whether GID meets the conditions as a mental disorder among children and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;Kamens, S.R. (2011). On the proposed sexual and gender identity diagnoses for DSM-5: history and controversies. ''The Humanistic Psychologist.'' 37–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, other researchers have stated that the diagnosis does not give recognition to the individual's discomfort with their biological sex which is completely detached from their gender assignment. This leaves patients susceptible to social changes for what acceptably feminine or masculine. Lastly, it does not provide evidence for nonconformity to traditional gender behaviours which varies between cultures, life stages, genders, and ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, K., Carroll, K., Denboske, K. Gender identity disorder – concerns and controversies. (2010). ''Handbook of Gender Research in Psychology''. 111-131.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Androgyny]]:'''
Recent studies have shown that androgynous people are able to enhance performance cross-situationally because they can alter their behaviors appropriately to becoming more “masculine” or “feminine” in the given context. According to a study, a person's activity preference in games and interests are purely based on their gender-typed stereotypes, making the person significantly more stereotyped than androgynous people. In a self-esteem test, when individuals were given opposite-sex activities, gender-typed individuals generally felt more uncomfortable, leading to decreased levels of self-esteem. However, androgynous subjects did not feel discomfort or pessimism about themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Bem, S. L., Lenney, E. (1976). Sex typing and the avoidance of cross-sex behavior. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.'' 33(1), 48-54.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, gender typing can often lead to specific gender-rule stereotypes to better facilitate decision making which can adhere to certain benefits as well as limitations. Therefore, parents who foster more non-traditional views in sex role orientation tend to encourage a less discriminatory environment. The child can then freely engage in more choices that are not affected by gender limitations. Androgynous children have been found to have higher [[self-esteem]] and higher [[self-worth]].&lt;ref&gt;Witt, S. D. (1997). Parental influence on children’s socialization to gender roles. ''Adolescence.'' 253-259.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drawbacks'''
Recent{{When|date=April 2013}} studies have shown that gender typing is, in fact, not just related to gender-related characteristics that is congruous with the person's biological sex, but rather holds different dimensions. Several studies have also revealed the perks of androgynous individuals such as having more adaptability towards gender-specific situations as well as more flexible attitudes about sex roles. Therefore, while there appear to be many benefits for a gender-congruent identity, it can also result in limitations. Because gender typing often reinforces stereotypes, it tends to attract negative and rigid attitudes towards atypical gender characteristics, activities, and interests.&lt;ref&gt;DiDonato, M.D., Berenbaum, S.A. (2011). The benefits and drawbacks of gender typing: How different dimensions are related to psychological adjustment. ''Arch Sex Behavior.'' 40. 457-463&lt;/ref&gt; This reinforces the idea that gender-typing does result in certain limitations towards the construction of one's identity.

==Examples of atypical development==
'''Boy Raised as Girl'''
After a circumcision accident, Bruce's parents turned to Psychologist Dr. [[John Money]] who suggested they raise the boy as a girl. Money believes that [[biology]] does not determine our gender identification; our environment does. At 17 months old, Bruce was renamed "Brenda". However, at age 13, "Brenda" became unhappy, lonely, and refused to pursue anything female-typed. Brenda's parents chose to tell Brenda the truth, and from then on he named himself David. This story ended in tragedy; [[David Reimer|David]] committed suicide after his wife left him and he lost his job.&lt;ref&gt;Health Check: the boy who was raised as a girl. (2010). https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11814300&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kate:'''
Ben had never shown interest in “boy” toys, they wanted to wear girl's clothing and grow long hair. Soon they started to make their gender clear: they talked about being a girl and their identity not matching anatomy. Finally, Ben told family they would go by Kate. In the beginning, the child lived a double life. In school, she was “Ben”; at home, she was Kate. Characteristics between the two identities drastically varied. Ben was quiet, shy and withdrawn, while Kate was extroverted and happy. Her parents could see that this was taking a toll on Kate and so they changed to a school where Kate could attend as herself. As the parent learned through this experience, supporting a child's gender identity is extremely important.&lt;ref&gt;Matthiessen, C. Parent power: raising Kate: one mom’s fight for her child’s identity. http://www.greatschools.org/parenting/5085-raising-transgender-child.gs&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pop:'''
In [[Sweden]], there is a couple who raised their child, Pop, by keeping the child's gender a secret, despite a few people who changed the baby's diaper. The parents stated that they wanted the baby to grow up free and without a gender mold. Pop's wardrobe contains everything from pants to dresses. Pop's parents avoid using pronouns and just refer to their child as “Pop.”&lt;ref&gt;Parafianowicz, L. Swedish parents keep 2-year-old’s gender secret. (2009).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14596">In [[fluid dynamics]], a flow with periodic variations is known as '''pulsatile flow''', or as '''Womersley flow'''. The flow profiles was first derived by [[John R. Womersley]] (1907–1958) in his work with blood flow in [[arteries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Properties ==

=== Womersley number ===
The pulsatile flow profile changes its shape depending on the Womersley number

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = R \left( \frac{\omega \rho}{\mu} \right)^{1/2} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;\alpha \lesssim 2&lt;/math&gt;, viscous forces dominate the flow, and the pulse is considered [[Quasistatic equilibrium|quasi-static]] with a parabolic profile.
For &lt;math&gt;\alpha \gtrsim 2&lt;/math&gt;, the inertial forces are dominant in the central core, whereas viscous forces dominate near the boundary layer. Thus, the velocity profile gets flattened, and [[Phase (waves)|phase]] between the pressure and velocity waves gets shifted towards the core.

=== Function limits ===

==== Lower limit ====

The Bessel function at its lower [[Limit of a function|limit]] becomes&lt;ref name=Mestel&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{z\to\infty} J_0(z) = 1 - \frac{z^2}{4} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

which converges to the [[Hagen-Poiseuille flow]] profile for steady flow for

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{n \to 0} u(r, t) = - \frac{P'_0}{4 \mu}  \left(R^2 - r^2 \right) \, , &lt;/math&gt;

or to a [[Quasistatic equilibrium|quasi-static]] pulse with parabolic profile when

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{\alpha \to 0} u(r, t) = Re \left\{ - \sum^N_{n=0} \frac{P'_n}{4 \mu}  (R^2 - r^2 ) \,  e^{i n \omega t} \right\} = - \sum^N_{n=0} \frac{P'_n}{4 \mu}  (R^2 - r^2 ) \, \cos(n \omega t) \, .&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the function is real, because the pressure and velocity waves are in phase.

==== Upper limit ====

The Bessel function at its upper limit it becomes&lt;ref name=Mestel/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{z\to\infty} J_0(z \, i) = \frac{e^z}{\sqrt{2\pi\, z}} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

which converges to

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{z\to\infty} u(r, t) = Re \left\{ \sum^N_{n=0} \frac{i \, P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ 1 - e^{\alpha \, n^{1/2} \, i^{1/2} \left(\frac{r}{R} - 1 \right) } \right] e^{i n \omega t} \right\} = - \sum^N_{n=0} \frac{\, P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ 1 - e^{\alpha \, n^{1/2}  \left(\frac{r}{R} - 1 \right) } \right] \sin(n\,\omega\, t) \, .&lt;/math&gt;

This is highly reminiscent of the Stokes layer on an oscillating flat plate, or the skin-depth penetration of an alternating magnetic field into an electrical conductor.
On the surface &lt;math&gt; u(r=R,t) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, but the exponential term becomes negligible once &lt;math&gt;\alpha (1 - r/R)&lt;/math&gt; becomes large, the velocity profile becomes almost constant and independent of the viscosity. Thus, the flow simply oscillates as a plug profile in time according to the pressure gradient,

:&lt;math&gt; \rho \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = - \sum^N_{n=0} P'_n \,.&lt;/math&gt;

However, close to the walls, in a layer of thickness &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(\alpha^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;, the velocity adjusts rapidly to zero. Furthermore, the phase of the time oscillation varies quickly with position across the layer. The exponential decay of the higher frequencies is faster.

== Derivation ==

For deriving the analytical solution of this non-stationary flow velocity profile, the following assumptions are taken:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

*Fluid is [[homogeneous]], [[incompressible]] and [[Newtonian fluid|Newtonian]];
*Tube wall is [[Stiffness|rigid]] and [[Circle|circular]];
*Motion is [[Laminar flow|laminar]], [[axisymmetric]] and parallel to the tube's axis;
*[[Boundary conditions]] are: axisymmetry at the centre, and no-slip condition on the wall;
*Pressure gradient is a [[periodic function]] that drives the fluid;
*[[Gravitation]] has no effect on the fluid.

Thus, the [[Navier-Stokes equation]] and the [[continuity equation]] are simplified as

:&lt;math&gt; \rho \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} =  -\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} + \mu \left(\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial r^2} + \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial u}{\partial r}\right) \, &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;  \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} =  0 \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

respectively. The pressure gradient driving the pulsatile flow is decomposed in [[Fourier series]],

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} (t) = \sum^N_{n=0}P'_n e^{in\omega t} \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[imaginary number]], &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular frequency]] of the first [[harmonic]] (i.e., &lt;math&gt;n = 1&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;P'_n&lt;/math&gt; are the [[amplitudes]] of each harmonic &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Note that, &lt;math&gt;P'_0&lt;/math&gt; (standing for &lt;math&gt;n = 0&lt;/math&gt;) is the steady-state pressure gradient, whose [[Sign (mathematics)|sign]] is opposed to the steady-state velocity (i.e., a negative pressure gradient yields positive flow). Similarly, the velocity profile is also decomposed in Fourier series in [[Phase (waves)|phase]] with the pressure gradient, because the fluid is incompressible,

:&lt;math&gt; u(r,t) = \sum^N_{n=0}U_n e^{in\omega t} \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;U_n&lt;/math&gt; are the amplitudes of each harmonic of the periodic function, and the steady component (&lt;math&gt;n = 0&lt;/math&gt;) is simply [[Poiseuille flow]]

:&lt;math&gt; U_0 = - \frac{P'_0}{4 \mu}  \left(R^2 - r^2 \right) \, . &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the Navier-Stokes equation for each harmonic reads as

:&lt;math&gt; i\rho n\omega U_n =  -P'_n +\mu \left(\frac{\partial^2 U_n}{\partial r^2} + \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial U_n}{\partial r}\right) \, .&lt;/math&gt;

With the boundary conditions satisfied, the general solution of this [[ordinary differential equation]] for the oscillatory part (&lt;math&gt;n \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;) is

:&lt;math&gt;  U_n(r) = A_n \, J_0 \left( \alpha \, \frac{r}{R} n^{1/2}\,i^{3/2} \right) + B_n \, Y_0 \left( \alpha \, \frac{r}{R} n^{1/2}\,i^{3/2} \right) + \frac{i\,P'_n}{\rho\, n\, \omega}\, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;J_0(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Bessel function]] of first kind and order zero, &lt;math&gt;Y_0(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the Bessel function of second kind and order zero, &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_n&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary constants, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha = R \surd( \omega \rho / \mu )&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dimensionless]] [[Womersley number]]. The axisymetic boundary condition (&lt;math&gt;\partial U_n/ \partial r|_{r=0} = 0&lt;/math&gt;) is applied to show that &lt;math&gt;B_n = 0&lt;/math&gt; for the derivative of above equation to be valid, as the derivatives &lt;math&gt;J_0'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y_0'&lt;/math&gt; approach infinity. Next, the wall non-slip boundary condition (&lt;math&gt;U_n(R) = 0&lt;/math&gt;) yields &lt;math&gt; A_n = - \frac{i \, P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \frac{1}{ J_0 \left( \alpha \, n^{1/2} \, i^{3/2} \right)}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, the amplitudes of the velocity profile of the harmonic &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; becomes

:&lt;math&gt;  U_n(r) = \frac{i\,P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ 1 - \frac{J_0(\alpha \, n^{1/2} \, i^{3/2} \, \frac{r}{R})}{J_0(\alpha \, n^{1/2} \, i^{3/2})} \right] = \frac{i\,P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ 1 - \frac{J_0(\Lambda_n \, \frac{r}{R})}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Lambda_n = \alpha \, n^{1/2} \, i^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt; is used for simplification.
The velocity profile itself is obtained by taking the [[Real number|real]] part of the [[complex function]] resulted from the [[summation]] of all harmonics of the pulse,

:&lt;math&gt; u(r, t) = \frac{P'_0}{4 \mu}  \left(R^2 - r^2 \right) + Re \left\{ \sum^N_{n=1} \frac{i \, P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ 1 - \frac{J_0(\Lambda_n \, \frac{r}{R})}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] e^{i n \omega t} \right\} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

=== Flow rate ===
[[Discharge (hydrology)|Flow rate]] is obtained by integrating the velocity field on the cross-section. Since,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} \left[ x^p J_p(a\,x) \right] = a\,x^p J_{p-1} (a\, x)
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\frac{d}{dx} \left[ x\, J_1(a\,x) \right] = a\,x J_{0} (a\, x) \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

then
 
:&lt;math&gt; Q(t) = \iint u(r, t) \, dA =  Re \left\{ \pi\,R^2 \, \sum^N_{n=1} \frac{i \, P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ 1 - \frac{2}{\Lambda_n}\frac{J_1(\Lambda_n)}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] e^{i n \omega t} \right\} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

===Velocity profile===
[[File:Comparison of velocity profile of Womersley flow.svg|200px|thumb|Scaled velocity profiles of pulsatile flow are compared according to Womersley number.]]
To compare the shape of the velocity profile, it can be assumed that

:&lt;math&gt; 
 u(r,t) = f(r)\,\frac{Q(t)}{A} \, ,
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; 
 f(r) = \frac{u(r,t)}{\frac{Q(t)}{A}} = Re \left\{ \sum^N_{n=1} \left[ \frac{\Lambda_n \, J_0(\Lambda_n) - \Lambda_n \, J_0(\Lambda_n \, \frac{r}{R})}{\Lambda_n \, J_0(\Lambda_n) - 2\,J_1(\Lambda_n)} \right] \right\}
&lt;/math&gt;

is the shape function.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is important to notice that this formulation ignores the inertial effects. The velocity profile approximates a parabolic profile or a plug profile, for low or high Womersley numbers, respectively.

=== Wall shear stress ===
For straight pipes, [[wall shear stress]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_w = \mu \left. \frac{\partial u}{\partial r} \right|_{r=R} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

The derivative of a Bessel function is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left[ x^{-p} J_{-p} (a\,x) \right] = a\,x^{-p} J_{p+1}(a\,x)
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left[ J_0 (a\,x) \right] = -a\,J_1(a\,x) \, .&lt;/math&gt;

Hence,

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_w = Re \left\{ \sum^N_{n=1} P'_n \frac{R}{\Lambda_n} \frac{J_1(\Lambda_n)}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} e^{i n \omega t} \right\} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

=== Centre line velocity ===
If the pressure gradient &lt;math&gt;P'_n&lt;/math&gt; is not measured, it can still be obtained by measuring the velocity at the centre line. The measured velocity has only the real part of the full expression in the form of

:&lt;math&gt; \tilde{u}(t) = Re(u(0, t)) \equiv \sum^N_{n=1} \tilde{U}_n \, \cos(n \, \omega \, t) \, .&lt;/math&gt;

Noting that &lt;math&gt;J_0(0) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, the full physical expression becomes

:&lt;math&gt; u(0, t) = Re \left\{ \sum^N_{n=1} \frac{i \, P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ \frac{J_0(\Lambda_n) - 1}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] e^{i n \omega t} \right\} &lt;/math&gt;

at the centre line. The measured velocity is compared with the full expression by applying some properties of complex number. For any product of complex numbers (&lt;math&gt;C = AB&lt;/math&gt;), the amplitude and phase have the relations &lt;math&gt;|C| = |A||B|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi_C = \phi_A + \phi_B&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Hence,

:&lt;math&gt; 
\tilde{U}_n = \left| \frac{i \, P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ \frac{J_0(\Lambda_n) - 1}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] \right| 
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
P'_n = \tilde{U}_n \left| i \, \rho \, n \, \omega \left[ \frac{J_0(\Lambda_n)}{1 - J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] \right|
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; 
\tilde{\phi} = 0 = \phi_{P'_n} + \phi_{U_n}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\phi_{P'_n} = \operatorname{phase} \left( \frac{i}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ \frac{1 - J_0(\Lambda_n)}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] \right) \, ,
&lt;/math&gt;

Allometric shifts will increase the overall variation in one trait relative to the other breaking their typical correlation]]
'''Allometric engineering''' is the process of experimentally shifting the [[allometry|scaling relationships]], for body size or shape, in a population of organisms. More specifically, the process of experimentally breaking the tight [[covariance]] evident among component traits of a complex [[phenotype]] by altering the [[variance]] of one [[Phenotypic trait|trait]] relative to another. Typically, body size is one of the two traits. The measurements of the two traits are plotted against each other and the scaling relationship can be represented as: &lt;math&gt; log(y) = mlog(x) + log(b) &lt;/math&gt;. Manipulations of this sort alter the scaling relationships either by shifting the intercept (''b''), slope (''m'') or both to create novel variants (see: [[Allometry]], for more details). These novel variants can then be tested for differences in performance or fitness. Through careful testing, one could sequentially test each component of a trait suite to determine how each part contributes to the function of the entire [[complex phenotype]], and ultimately the fitness of the organism. This technique allows for comparison within or among biological groups differing in size by adjusting morphology to match one another and comparing their performances.&lt;ref name=sinervo&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sinervo, B.  |author2=Huey, R. |year=1990 |title= Allometric Engineering: An Experimental Test of the Causes of Interpopulational Differences in Performance |pages= 1106–1109 |journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=248 |doi= 10.1126/science.248.4959.1106 |url= http://faculty.washington.edu/hueyrb/pdfs/SinervoScience1.pdf |issue=4959 |pmid=17733374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples and application==

===Lack's hypothesis===
Allometric engineering has been used to test [[David Lack]]'s hypothesis in the lizard ''[[Sceloporus occidentalis]]''.&lt;ref name=sinervo/&gt; In this study, two populations were "engineered" to fit the morphology of the other by manipulating egg yolk quantity, removing effect of size difference between groups. After manipulation, they found that speed was inversely proportional to body size.

===Nature versus nurture===
Maternal investment was "allometrically engineered" by surgically removing an ovary in cockroaches (''[[Diploptera punctata]]'').&lt;ref name=Holbrook&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Holbrook, G.  |author2=Schal, C.|year=2004|title=Maternal investment affects offspring phenotypic plasticity in a viviparous cockroach |journal=PNAS |volume=101 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.0400209101 |pmc=397435| issue=15 |pages=5595–5597 | pmid=15064397}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effectively reduced number of progeny and increased resource allocation to each offspring. They coupled this manipulation with group effects (faster development in large groups), and found that maternal investment can overcome group effect.

===Sexual selection===
The male [[long-tailed widowbird]] (''Euplectes progne'') has exceptionally long tail feathers roughly half a meter in length.&lt;ref name=Andersson&gt;{{cite journal|author =Andersson, Malte|year=1982|title=Female choice selects for extreme tail length in a widowbird|doi=10.1038/299818a0|pages=818–820|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=299|issue=5886}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Male tail feathers were cropped and glued and those with artificially enhanced tail lengths secured the most matings, demonstrating female preference.

===Natural selection===
The fly ''[[Zonosemata]] vittigera'' has a banding pattern on its wings that was found to mimic movements of a jumping spider. Greene ''et al.'' engineered novel phenotypes, breaking correlation between a behavior and morphology, by cutting and transplanting the wings of this fly with the common [[housefly]].&lt;ref name=Greene&gt;{{cite journal |author = Greene, E. |author2=Orsak, L. |author3=Whitman, D. |last-author-amp=yes |year=1987 |title=A Tephritid Fly Mimics the Territorial Displays of its Jumping Spider Predators |doi= 10.1126/science.236.4799.310 |pages= 310–312 |journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=236 |issue=4799 |pmid=17755555}} see: [[Tephritid fly]].&lt;/ref&gt; This manipulation demonstrated that it was behavior coupled with the banding pattern that deterred jumping spiders from attacking, though not other predators.

==Methods==
Current uses have involved truncation or cropping, yolk manipulation, hormonal treatments, maternal allocation, temperature manipulation, or altering the nutritional states.&lt;ref name=sinervo1&gt;{{cite journal |author = Sinervo, B. |year=1993 |title=The Effect of Offspring Size on Physiology and Life History |pages= 210–218 |volume=43 |issue=4 |jstor= 1312121 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each method undoubtedly has its merits and pitfalls to consider before designing an experiment, but these techniques are opening new avenues of research in comparative and evolutionary biology.

[[File:Compensatory Growth.jpg|thumb|400px|Representation of compensatory growth]]

'''Compensatory growth''', known as '''catch-up growth''' and '''compensatory gain''', is an accelerated growth of an organism following a period of slowed development, particularly as a result of [[nutrient]] deprivation.&lt;ref name="GerrardGrant2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David E.

An organism can recover to normal weight without additional time.&lt;ref name="GerrardGrant2002"/&gt; Sometimes when the nutrient restriction is severe, the growth period is extended to reach the normal weight.&lt;ref name="GerrardGrant2002"/&gt; If the nutrient restriction is severe enough, the organism may have permanent [[stunted growth]] where it does not ever reach normal weight.&lt;ref name="GerrardGrant2002"/&gt; Usually in animals, complete recovery from [[carbohydrate]] and [[protein]] restriction occurs.&lt;ref name="fundamentals of modern agriculture"/&gt;

==History==
In 1911, Hans Aron performed the earliest study of growth after periods of undernourishment.&lt;ref name="HenryUlijaszek1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=C. J. K. Henry|author2=Stanley J. Ulijaszek|title=Long-term consequences of early environment: growth, development, and the lifespan developmental perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=66JbrqPjINgC&amp;pg=PA128|accessdate=6 June 2011|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-47108-4|pages=124–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; He underfed a dog and found that it still had the capacity to rapidly gain weight, though it did not reach the final weight of a dog that was fed normally.&lt;ref name="HenryUlijaszek1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aron&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aron|first=H.|year=1911 |title=Nutrition and growth|journal=Philippine Journal of Sciences, Section B (Medical Science) |volume=6|pages=1–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915, Osborne and Mendel were the first to demonstrate that rats fed after growth restriction had an accelerated growth rate.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;&lt;ref name="HenryUlijaszek1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Osborne&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Osborne|first1=T.B.|last2= Mendel |first2=L. B.|year=1915 |title=The resumption of growth after long continued failure to grow|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=23|pages=439–454}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, Brody developed the idea of “homoestasis of growth” in the book ''Bioenergetics and Growth''.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;&lt;ref name="HenryUlijaszek1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brody"&gt;{{cite book|author=S. Brody |title= Bioenergetics and Growth|year=1945|publisher= Reinhold }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, Verle Bohman was the first to use the term “compensatory growth” in an article pertaining to [[beef cattle]].&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bohman&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bohman |first=V. R. |year=1955 |title= Compensatory Growth of Beef Cattle: The Effect of Hay Maturity |journal= Journal of Animal Science |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages= 249–255 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
In animals, [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] and [[Homeorhesis|homeorhetic]] processes are involved in the abnormally high growth rates.&lt;ref name="GerrardGrant2002"/&gt; Homeostatic processes usually affect compensatory growth in the short term, whereas homeorhetic processes usually have a long-term effect.&lt;ref name="LawrenceFowler2002"/&gt;

The exact biological mechanisms for compensatory growth are poorly understood, though it is clear that in some animals the [[endocrine system]] is involved in the [[metabolism]] and nutrient partitioning in the tissues.&lt;ref name="GerrardGrant2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scanes2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=C. G. Scanes|title=Biology of growth of domestic animals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R4Qau0BMeoIC&amp;pg=PA352|accessdate=6 June 2011|date=24 April 2003|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-8138-2906-7|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;
First, during nutrient starvation, a reduction of [[Basal animal metabolic rate|basal metabolism]] takes place.&lt;ref name="GerrardGrant2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scanes2003"/&gt; The gut tissues are the first tissues to be reduced in weight and activity.&lt;ref name="Scanes2003"/&gt; Then, during the realimentation (re-feeding) phase, an increase in feeding enables more dietary protein and energy to be contributed for tissue growth instead of basal metabolism.&lt;ref name="GerrardGrant2002"/&gt; The gut tissues are the first to increase in weight, followed by muscle tissue and finally adipose tissue.&lt;ref name="Scanes2003"/&gt;

==Studies of growth in anorexic human patients==
[[Anorexia nervosa]] can have serious implications if its duration and severity are significant and if onset occurs before the completion of growth, pubertal maturation or prior to attaining peak bone mass.&lt;ref name="medical"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-0968(200003)8:2&lt;170::AID-ERV338&gt;3.0.CO;2-Y|title=Medical complications of anorexia nervosa in children and young adolescents|year=2000|last1=Nicholls|first1=Dasha|last2=Stanhope|first2=Richard|journal=European Eating Disorders Review|volume=8|issue=2|pages=170–180}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Both height gain and pubertal development are dependent on the release of growth hormone and gonadotrophins (LH and FSH) from the pituitary gland. Suppression of gonadotropins in patients with anorexia nervosa has been frequently documented.&lt;ref name="medical"/&gt; In some cases, especially where onset is pre-pubertal, physical consequences such as stunted growth and pubertal delay are usually fully reversible.&lt;ref name="CG9FullGuideline"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health|year=2004 |title=Core interventions in the treatment and management of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and related eating disorders |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG9FullGuideline.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Height potential is normally preserved if the duration and severity of anorexia nervosa are not significant and/or if the illness is accompanied with delayed bone age (especially prior to a bone age of approximately 15 years), as hypogonadism may negate the deleterious effects of undernutrition on stature by allowing for a longer duration of growth compared to controls.&lt;ref name="pediatrics"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, appropriate early treatment can preserve height potential and may even help to increase it in some post-anorexic subjects due to the aforementioned reasons in addition to factors such as long-term reduced estrogen-producing [[adipose tissue]] levels compared to premorbid levels.&lt;ref name="Estrogen production and action"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nelson LR, Bulun SE |title=Estrogen production and action |journal=J.

==Factors affecting compensatory growth==
In 1960, Wilson and Osborne outlined six factors that could affect compensatory growth in a review article.&lt;ref name="LawrenceFowler2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; The importance of each, some, or all of these factors is not well understood.&lt;ref name="fundamentals of modern agriculture"/&gt; These factors are as follows:&lt;ref name="LawrenceFowler2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fundamentals of modern agriculture"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;
*  The nature of the restricted diet
*  The degree of severity of undernutrition
*  The duration of the period of undernutrition
*  The stage of development at the commencement of undernutrition
*  The relative rate of maturity of the species
*  The pattern of re-alimenation

Animal factors that can affect compensatory growth may include the maturity level and fat proportion of the animal at the time of nutrient deprivation, the genotype, the gender, and the metabolic changes.&lt;ref name="LawrenceFowler2002"/&gt; The stage of development of the animal when the nutrient restriction occurs greatly affects its body composition.&lt;ref name="GerrardGrant2002"/&gt;

'''Despeciation''' is the loss of a unique species of animal due to its combining with another previously distinct species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Despeciation|url=http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=24093|work=Stedman's Medical Dictionary|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the opposite of [[Speciation]] and is much more rare.  It is similar to extinction in that there is a loss of a unique [[species]] but without the associated loss of a biological lineage. Despeciation has been noted in species of  butterflies, sunflowers, mosquitoes, fish, wolves, and even humans.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/biology/two-become-one-raven-species-reverse-darwin-s-tree|title=Two become one: raven species reverse Darwin's tree {{!}} Cosmos|website=cosmosmagazine.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== The Process: Convergent Evolution and Examples of Despeciation ==
A prime example of despeciation is convergent evolution due to the fact that it causes two species that live in same environment to become the same due to the similar functions and behaviors that it must partake in to survive in that habitat. Common examples of convergent evolution are [[Müllerian mimicry|Mullerian]] and [[Batesian mimicry|Batesian]] mimicry. Batesian mimicry is when one species that is harmless mimics a more threatening, or intimidating, species as to prevent it from being killed. Mullerian mimicry is when two organisms mimic each other as to prevent either species from being killed by predators.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/Convergence.html|title=Convergent Evolution|website=www.zo.utexas.edu|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despeciation also occurs when two diverged species begin to interact in the same region. Ravens provide a prime example of this. Holarctic Ravens and Californian Ravens had been two separate species for 1.5 million years until tens of thousands of years ago when their regions overlapped and they began to merge into a new species. This new raven species contains genes coming from both the Holarctic and Californian Raven. This was possible because they occupy the same area of the Western United States.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/biology/two-become-one-raven-species-reverse-darwin-s-tree|title=Two become one: raven species reverse Darwin's tree {{!}} Cosmos|website=cosmosmagazine.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example of three-spined sticklebacks==
[[Image:Gasterosteus aculeatus.jpg|thumb|left|The [[three-spined stickleback]] (''Gasterosteus aculeatus'')]]
Another possible cause for despeciation is increased gene flow and hybridization due to changes in the environment. One of these changes could include the loss of essential nourishment resources for each individual species.  For example, Taylor et al.'s genetic analysis of [[three-spined stickleback]]s across six lakes in southwestern [[British Columbia]] found two distinct species in 1977 and 1988 but only one combined species in data from 1997, 2000, and 2002. The new species is a hybrid and shows an intermediate form of the parental genotype.  They concluded that external factors had imperiled the living conditions of the two species, thus eliminating the evolutionary specializations that had kept them unique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=TAYLOR|first=E. B.|last2=BOUGHMAN|first2=J. W.|last3=GROENENBOOM|first3=M.|last4=SNIATYNSKI|first4=M.|last5=SCHLUTER|first5=D.|last6=GOW|first6=J.

&lt;br /&gt;

== How Does This Affect Us? ==
Other common examples of despeciation pertain to ''Homo sapiens''. ''Homo sapiens'' once were two lineages, Neanderthals and Denisovans. However, due to common ecological niches, common ancestry, similar environment, and interbreeding, they merged into one species.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;...... &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-is-despeciation.html|title=What Is Despeciation?|work=WorldAtlas|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2972">'''Unconventional protein secretion''' (known as ER/Golgi-independent protein secretion or nonclassical protein export&lt;ref name="bla3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Backhaus|first=R|author2=Zehe, C |author3=Wegehingel, S |author4=Kehlenbach, A |author5=Schwappach, B |author6= Nickel, W |title=Unconventional protein secretion: membrane translocation of FGF-2 does not require protein unfolding.|journal=Journal of Cell Science|date=Apr 1, 2004|volume=117|issue=Pt 9|pages=1727–36|pmid=15075234|doi=10.1242/jcs.01027}}&lt;/ref&gt; ) represents a manner in which the proteins are delivered to the surface of [[plasma membrane]] or [[extracellular matrix]] independent of the [[Endoplasmic reticulum]] or [[Golgi apparatus]].&lt;ref name="bla1"/&gt; This includes [[cytokines]] and [[mitogens]] with crucial function in complex processes such as inflammatory response or tumor-induced angiogenesis. Most of these proteins are involved in processes in higher [[eukaryotes]], however an unconventional export mechanism was found in lower eukaryotes too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nickel|first=W|title=Pathways of unconventional protein secretion.|journal=Current Opinion in Biotechnology|date=Oct 2010|volume=21|issue=5|pages=621–6|pmid=20637599|doi=10.1016/j.copbio.2010.06.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even proteins folded in their correct conformation can pass plasma membrane this way, unlike proteins transported via [[Endoplasmic reticulum#Protein transport|ER/Golgi pathway]].&lt;ref name="bla3"/&gt;  Two types of unconventional protein secretion are these: signal-peptid-containing proteins and cytoplasmatic and  nuclear proteins that are missing  an ER-signal peptide (1).&lt;ref name="bla1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nickel|first=W|author2=Rabouille, C |title=Mechanisms of regulated unconventional protein secretion.|journal=Nature Reviews.

==Signal-peptide-containing proteins==
These proteins contain a specific signal-peptide sequence, which is to be translated into the [[endoplasmic reticulum]], but are, however, able to reach the cell surface unconventionally. They can be packed into a COPII-coated vesicle and directly fuse with plasma membrane or can fuse with endosomal or lysosomal compartment. Alternatively, they can be packed into non-COPII-coated vesicle as well and fuse with Golgi (before reaching plasma membrane) or directly delivered to the plasma membrane.&lt;ref name="bla1"/&gt;

==Cytoplasmatic/nuclear secretory proteins==
Soluble proteins can reach the surface of the cell both by non-vesicular and vesicular mechanisms. Non-vesicular mechanisms use a carrier to get proteins into extracellular space (for example phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate). Vesicular mechanisms can  use the [[lysosome-dependent pathway]], [[microvesicle shedding]] or biogenesis of [[multivesicular bodies]].&lt;ref name="bla1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10556">A '''bridged nucleic acid''' ('''BNA''') is a modified [[RNA]] nucleotide. They are sometimes also referred to as constrained or inaccessible RNA [[molecules]]. BNA [[monomers]] can contain a five-membered, six-membered or even a seven-membered bridged structure with a “fixed” C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;’-endo sugar puckering.&lt;ref&gt;Saenger, W. (1984) ''Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure'', Springer-Verlag, New York, {{ISBN|3-540-90761-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge is synthetically incorporated at the 2’, 4’-position of the ribose to afford a 2’, 4’-BNA monomer. The monomers can be incorporated into [[oligonucleotide]] polymeric structures using standard phosphoamidite chemistry. BNAs are structurally rigid oligo-nucleotides with increased binding affinities and stability.

The 3D structures for A-RNA and B-DNA were used as a template for the design of the BNA monomers. The goal for the design was to find derivatives that possess high binding affinities with complementary RNA and/or DNA strands.

[[File:BNAH1.png|thumb|The 3D structures for A-RNA and B-DNA]]

[[File:BNAH2.png|thumb
The presence of 2’-hydroxyls in the RNA backbone favors a structure that resembles the A-form structure of DNA. The flexible five-membered [[furanose]] ring in nucleotides exists in [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]] of two preferred conformations of the N- (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;’-endo, A-form) and the S-type (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;’-endo, B-form) as illustrated in the next figure.]]

An increased conformational inflexibility of the sugar moiety in [[nucleosides]] (oligonucleotides) results in a gain of high binding affinity with complementary single-stranded RNA and/or double-stranded DNA. The first 2’,4’-BNA (LNA) monomers were first synthesized by Takeshi Imanishi’s group in 1997&lt;ref name=j1/&gt; followed independently by Jesper Wengel’s group in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Koshkin|first1=A. A.|last2=Singh|first2=S. K.|last3=Nielsen|first3=P.|last4=Rajwanshi|first4=V. K.|last5=Kumar|first5=R.|last6=Meldgaard|first6=M.|last7=Olsen|first7=C.

[[File:BNAH6.png|thumb|Chemical structures of other BNAs that were synthesized in the past years as indicated below the structures.]]

BNA [[nucleotides]] can be incorporated into DNA or RNA [[oligonucleotides]] at any desired position. Such oligomers are synthesized chemically and are now commercially available. The bridged ribose conformation enhances base stacking and pre-organizes the backbone of the oligonucleotide significantly increasing their hybridization properties. 
 
The incorporation of BNAs into oligonucleotides allows the production of modified synthetic oligonucleotides with 
equal or higher binding affinity against an DNA or RNA complement with excellent single-mismatch discriminating power;  
better RNA selective binding; 
stronger and more sequence selective triplex-forming characters; 
pronounced higher nuclease resistance, even higher than  Sp-phosphorothioate analogues; and
good aqueous [[solubility]] of the resulting oligonucleotides when compared to regular DNA or RNA oligonucleotides.

[[File:BNAH8.png|thumb|
Chemical structures of BNAs were introduced in 2007 by Imanishi’s group.&lt;ref name="AbdurRahman" /&gt; These new generation of BNAs analogues are called 2’,4’-BNA&lt;sup&gt;NC&lt;/sup&gt;[NH], 2’,4’-BNA&lt;sup&gt;NC&lt;/sup&gt;[NMe], and 2’,4’-BNA&lt;sup&gt;NC&lt;/sup&gt;[NBn].]]

New BNA analogs introduced by Imanishi’s group were designed by taking the length of the bridged [[moiety (chemistry)|moiety]] into account. A six-membered bridged structure with a unique structural feature (N-O bond) in the sugar moiety was designed to have a nitrogen atom. This atom improves the formation of duplexes and triplexes by lowering the repulsion between the negatively charged backbone phosphates. These modifications allow to control the affinity towards complementary strands, regulate resistance against nuclease degradation and the synthesis of functional molecules designed for specific applications in genomics. The properties of these analogs were investigated and compared to those of previous 2’,4’-BNA (LNA) modified oligonucleotides by Imanishi’s group. Imanishi’s results show that “2’,4’-BNA&lt;sup&gt;NC&lt;/sup&gt;-modified oligonucleotides with these profiles show great promise for applications in antisense and antigene technologies.”

[[File:BNAH9.png|thumb|Makoto Koizumi in 2004 reviewed the properties of BNAs with focus on ENAs as antisense and antigen oligonucleotides (AONs) and proposed an action mechanism for these compounds that may involve translation arrest, mRNA degradation mediated by RNase H and splicing arrest.]]

==Proposed mechanism of action of AONs==
Yamamoto et al. in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Koizumi|first1=M.|title=ENA oligonucleotides as therapeutics|journal=Current Opinion in Molecular Therapeutics|volume=8|issue=2|pages=144–149|year=2006|pmid=16610767 }}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that BNA-based antisense therapeutics inhibited hepatic PCSK9 expression, resulting in a strong reduction of the serum LDL-C levels of mice. The findings supported the hypothesis that PCSK9 is a potential therapeutic target for hypercholesterolemia and the researchers were able to show that BNA-based antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) induced cholesterol-lowering action in hypercholesterolemic mice.  A moderate increase of aspartate aminotransferase, ALT, and blood urea nitrogen levels was observed whereas the histopathological analysis revealed no severe hepatic toxicities. The same group, also in 2012, reported that the 2’,4’-BNA&lt;sup&gt;NC&lt;/sup&gt;[NMe] analog when used in antisense oligonucleotides showed significantly stronger inhibitory activities which is more pronounced in shorter (13- to 16mer) oligonucleotides. Their data led the researchers to conclude that the 2’,4’-BNA&lt;sup&gt;NC&lt;/sup&gt;[NMe] analog may be a better alternative to conventional LNAs.

==Benefits of the BNA technology==
Some of the benefits of BNAs include ideal for the detection of short RNA and DNA targets; increase the thermal stability of duplexes; capable of single nucleotide discrimination; increases the thermal stability of triplexes; resistance to exo- and enconucleases resulting in a high stability for ''in vivo'' and ''in vitro'' applications; increased target specificity; facilitate Tm normalization; strand invasion enables detection of “hard to access” samples; compatible with standard enzymatic processes.{{cn|date=January 2019}}

==Application of the BNA technology==
Application of BNAs include small RNA research; design and synthesis of RNA aptamers; siRNA; antisense probes; diagnostics; isolation; microarray analysis; Northern blotting; real-time PCR; ''in situ'' hybridization; functional analysis; SNP detection and use as antigens and many others  nucleotide base applications.{{cn|date=January 2019}}

The '''dorsal nexus''' is an area within the dorsal medial [[prefrontal cortex]] that serves as an intersection point for multiple [[brain]] networks. Research suggests it plays a role in the maintenance and manipulation of information, as well as supporting the control of cognitive functions such as behavior, memory, and conflict resolution. Abnormally increased connectivity between these networks through the Dorsal Nexus has been associated with certain types of depression. The activity generated by this abnormally high level of connectivity during a depressive state can be identified through [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[Positron emission tomography]] (PET).

==Anatomy and function==

The brain's intrinsic connections are divided into different networks that enable communication between the different structures: The cognitive control network, or [[Executive network]] (EN), the [[affective]] network or [[Somatic nervous system|somatic]] network, and the default mode network.&lt;ref name="Sheline"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sheline |first1=Yvette |last2=Yan |first2= Shizi |year= 2010 |title= Resting-state functional MRI in depression unmasks increased connectivity between networks via the dorsal nexus |journal= PNAS |volume= 107|issue= |pages= 11020–11025|publisher= |doi= 10.1073/pnas.1000446107 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/05/24/1000446107 |accessdate=16 April 2013 |pmid=20534464 |pmc=2890754}}&lt;/ref&gt; These regions are dependent on the dorsal nexus to communicate.&lt;ref name="Sheline"/&gt;

The EN is located in the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] and lateral parietal cortex, and is responsible for the maintenance and manipulation of the information in [[working memory]]. The EN also plays an important role as support of adaptive, goal-directed behaviors, which is why it is colloquially referred to as "the problem solver."&lt;ref name="Maletic, V."&gt;{{cite web |last1=Maletic |first1=Vladimir |year= 2012 |title=Role of Default Mode Network in Depression |publisher=Psych Congress Network|url=https://www.psychcongress.com/blog/role-default-mode-network-depression|accessdate=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The affective (or salience) network includes connections between the [[limbic]] area and [[subcortical]] areas, and is important during fear and vigilance states, as well as for autonomic and visceral regulation.&lt;ref name="Maletic, V."/&gt; It also generates the somatic sensations that accompany emotions.&lt;ref name=UHN&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year= |title= Depression and the Brain |journal= UHN rTMS Clinic |volume= |issue= |pages= |publisher= |doi= |url= http://rtmsclinic.ca/?page_id=31  |accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The default mode is most active when the brain is at rest, or when a person is communicating socially. Its activity decreases during the performance of cognitively demanding tasks.&lt;ref name="Sheline"/&gt;

==Dorsal nexus and depression==
[[Neuroimaging]] studies have shown that many neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders are associated with abnormalities in the functional connectivity of [[neural networks]]. MRIs indicate that the dorsal nexus is responsible for connecting these networks, and this might explain how symptoms of depression are influenced by the state of brain networks.&lt;ref name="Sheline"/&gt; The increased connectivity can produce symptoms of decreased focus and increased vigilance, which can present as [[paranoia]], [[rumination (psychology)|rumination]] or autonomic, visceral and emotional imbalance.&lt;ref name=Lanfranco&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lanfranco |first1=Renzo|year= 2011 |title= Alteraciones de la conectividad funcional de la Default-Mode network en la depresión mayor:una breve mirada a la actividad intrínseca del cerebro |journal= Trastor|volume=7|issue=|pages=138147|publisher=|doi=|url=http://neurocognitiva.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Lanfranco-R.-2011-Alteraciones-en-DMN-y-Depresión.pdf |accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subjects with depression were observed to have abnormal connectivity in the bilateral parahipocampal cortex, as well as an increase of hyperintensity of white matter. Increased default-mode network connectivity, mediated via a region of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, may underline the characteristics of depression. In this pathology, the dorsal nexus is strongly connected to the task-positive, task-negative and affective networks. The function of this node is to allow enhanced “cross-talk” between networks, and this may explain how the diverse symptoms seen in depression converge &lt;ref name=Norbury&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Norbury |first1=R |last2=Mannie |first2=Z |last3= Cowen|first3=PJ |year= 2011 |title=Imaging vulnerability for depression|journal=Molecular Psychiatry |volume=16 |issue= |pages=1067–1068|publisher=|doi=10.1038/mp.2011.4|url=http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/v16/n11/full/mp201144a.html|accessdate=16 April 2013|pmc=4021719}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dorsal nexus can be related to two different types of depression: decreased and major depression. It is important to mention that there is a big difference between these two types: With decreased depression, the connectivity between the cingulated subgenual cortex and amygdala, pale striatum, and medial thalamus is diminished. In the case of major depression, connectivity is normal. This could explain differences in response to drugs and psychotherapy.&lt;ref name=Lanfranco/&gt;

==Diagnosis of depression involving dorsal nexus==
Neuroimaging techniques allow of imaging of the nervous system in vivo, and permit scientists to explore the structures and functions of the human brain. In [[neuropsychiatry]], neuroimaging techniques such as MRI and [[Positron Emission Tomography]] allow the identification of different networks that are implicated in various pathologies.&lt;ref name=UHN/&gt;

In the case of depression, portions of three different networks (the cognitive control network, the default mode network and the affective network) which are related with conflict resolution, making decisions, behavior, regulate memory and future planning present increased function in MRI’s. These three increased connectivity networks converged specifically on the dorsal nexus. The dorsal nexus has extremely high connectivity with large regions including dorso lateral prefrontal cortex, dorso medial prefrontal cortex, ventral medial prefrontal cortex, pregenual an subgenual cortex, posterior cingulate, and [[precuneus]]. Because these networks can be determined for each individual based on the strength of correlation to an a priori seed location, group statistical differences in networks can be evaluated on an image – wide basis.&lt;ref name="Sheline"/&gt;

==Treatment==
Treating the symptoms of depression has the purpose of reduce and control the dysfunction that patients could have in any areas of their life. The choice of treatment is based on the needs of the patient and can include drugs, therapy and other similar treatments. Regardless of the chosen treatment, it is necessary to consider possible side effects .&lt;ref name="Erowid Ketamine Vault: Dosage"&gt;[http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ketamine/ketamine_dose.shtml Erowid Ketamine Vault: Dosage]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the case of depression associated with dorsal nexus and other associated structures, reducing the increased connectivity might play a critical role reducing depression [[symptomatology]] and thus represent a potential therapy target for affective disorders &lt;ref name=Sheidegger&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scheidegger |first1=Milan |last2=Walter |first3=Martin |last3= Lehmann|year= 2012 |title=Ketamine decreases resting state functional connectivity between networks via the dorsal nexus: implications for major depression |journal=Reson |volume=20 |issue= |pages=124|publisher=|doi=|url=http://www.mr.ethz.ch/abstracts/files/ismrm12_0124.pdf |accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[glutamate]] is the most abundant and major excitatory [[neurotransmitter]] in the brain, [[pathophysiological]] changes in glutamatergic signaling are likely to affect neurobehavioral plasticity, information processing and large-scales changes in functional brain connectivity.&lt;ref name=Sheidegger/&gt;[[Ketamine]], a fast-acting general [[anesthetic]] derived from [[phencyclidine]] and use as a pediatric inductor, plays a non-well known role in the [[neural network]] dynamics at the healthy brain . The administration of ketamine in abnormal brain has the potential of reduce the increased function of the networks that are seen in depression. The therapeutic potential of ketamine may be explained by reversing disturbances in the glutamatergic system and restoring parts of a disrupted neurobehavioral [[homeostasis]] where several structural, metabolic, and functional abnormalities have taken place.&lt;ref name=Sheidegger/&gt; Long term ketamine treatments lead to [[cognitive impairment]] including problems of short-term memory, visual and verbal memory. On the other hand, short term treatments are generally well tolerated and any damage may be reversible.&lt;ref name="Erowid Ketamine Vault: Dosage"/&gt;

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) significantly reduces functional connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Dorsal nexus) and the anterior cingulate cortex, the medial prefrontal cortex, and other areas implicated in major depression.&lt;ref name=Valero&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Valero|first1=Tom|last2=|first2=|year=2012|title=FMRI Data Offer Clues about the Brain Mechanism Behind ECT for Severe Depression|journal=American Academy of Neurology|volume=|issue=|pages=|publisher=|doi=|url=http://www.aan.com/elibrary/neurologytoday/?event=home.showArticle&amp;id=ovid.com:/bib/ovftdb/00132985-201205030-00003|accessdate=17 April 2013}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although electroconvulsive therapy has been used as a treatment for depression since 1930, it has several side effects as loss of memory, confusion and difficulties in forming new memories. Because of this reasons, this kind of treatment is limited to severely damaged patients.&lt;ref name=Norton&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Norton |first1= Elizabeth |last2= |first2= |date=19 March 2012 |title= Insight Into a Shocking Therapy for Depression |journal= Science Now|volume= |issue= |pages= |publisher= |doi= |url= http://news.sciencemag.org/2012/03/insight-shocking-therapy-depression |accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10901">A '''mode of toxic action''' is a common set of [[physiological]] and [[behavioral]] signs that characterize a type of adverse biological response.&lt;ref name="rand"&gt;{{cite book | author = Rand G | title = Fundamentals of Aquatic Toxicology: Effects, Environmental Fate, and Risk Assessment | year = 1995 | publisher = CRC Press | location =Boca Raton, FL | isbn = 1-56032-091-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[mode of action]] should not be confused with [[mechanism of action]], which refer to the [[biochemical]] processes underlying a given mode of action.&lt;ref name="escher02"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Escher BI, Hermens JL | title = Modes of action in ecotoxicology: their role in body burdens, species sensitivity, QSARs, and mixture effects | journal = Environ. Sci. Technol. | volume = 36 | issue = 20 | pages = 4201–17 |date=October 2002 | pmid = 12387389 | doi =  10.1021/es015848h}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modes of toxic action are important, widely used tools in [[ecotoxicology]] and [[aquatic toxicology]] because they classify [[toxicant]]s or [[pollution|pollutants]] according to their type of toxic action. There are two major types of modes of toxic action: non-specific acting toxicants and specific acting toxicants. Non-specific acting toxicants are those that produce [[narcotic|narcosis]], while specific acting toxicants are those that are non-narcotic and that produce a specific action at a specific target site.

== Types ==

=== Non-specific ===

[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes (FATS)|Non-specific acting modes of toxic action]] result in [[narcotic|narcosis]]; therefore, narcosis is a mode of toxic action. Narcosis is defined as a generalized depression in [[biological activity]] due to the presence of [[toxicant]] [[molecules]] in the organism.&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt; The target site and mechanism of toxic action through which narcosis affects organisms are still unclear, but there are [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] that support that it occurs through alterations in the [[cell membranes]] at specific sites of the membranes, such as the [[lipid bilayer|lipid layers]] or the [[proteins]] bound to the membranes. Even though continuous exposure to a [[narcotic]] toxicant can produce [[death]], if the exposure to the toxicant is stopped, narcosis can be reversible.

=== Specific ===

[[Toxicant]]s that at low [[concentrations]] modify or inhibit some biological process by binding at a specific site or [[molecule]] have a specific acting mode of toxic action.&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt; However, at high enough concentrations, toxicants with specific acting modes of toxic actions can produce [[narcotic|narcosis]] that may or may not be reversible. Nevertheless, the specific action of the toxicant is always shown first because it requires lower concentrations.

There are several specific acting modes of toxic action:
*'''''[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes (FATS)|Uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation]]'''''. Involves toxicants that uncouple the two processes that occur in [[oxidative phosphorylation]]: [[electron transfer]] and [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) production.
* '''''Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors'''''. [[Acetylcholinesterase|AChE]] is an [[enzyme]] associated with [[nerve]] [[synapses]] that it’s designed to regulate nerve impulses by breaking down the [[neurotransmitter]] [[Acetylcholine]] (ACh). When toxicants bind to AChE, they inhibit the breakdown of ACh. This results in continued nerve impulses across the synapses, which eventually cause nerve system damage. Examples of AChE inhibitors are [[organophosphates]] and [[carbamates]], which are components found in [[pesticides]] (see [[Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors]]).
* '''''Irritants'''''. These are chemicals that cause an [[inflammation|inflammatory]] effect on living tissue by chemical action at the site of contact. The resulting effect of [[Irritation|irritants]] is an increase in the [[volume]] of cells due to a change in size ([[hypertrophy]]) or an increase in the number of cells ([[hyperplasia]]). Examples of irritants are [[benzaldehyde]], [[acrolein]], [[zinc sulphate]] and [[chlorine]].
* '''''Central nervous system (CNS) seizure agents'''''. [[Central nervous system|CNS]] seizure agents inhibit [[cellular signaling]] by acting as [[receptor antagonists]]. They result in the inhibition of biological responses. Examples of CNS seizure agents are [[organochlorine]] [[pesticides]].
* '''''Respiratory blockers'''''. These are toxicants that affect [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] by interfering with the [[electron transport chain]] in the [[mitochondria]]. Examples of respiratory blockers are [[rotenone]] and [[cyanide]].

== Determination ==

The pioneer work of identifying the major categories of modes of toxic action (see description above) was conducted by investigators from the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) at the Duluth Laboratory using fish,&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mccarty93"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=McCarty LS, McCarty D | title = Enhancing ecotoxicological modeling and assessment: body residues and modes of toxic action|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology | year = 1993 | volume = 27 | issue = 9 | pages = 1719–1728 | doi=10.1021/es00046a001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="escher10"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Escher BI, Ashauer R, Dyer S, Hermens JL, Lee JH, Leslie HA, Mayer P, Meador JP, Warne MS | title = Crucial role of mechanisms and modes of toxic action for understanding tissue residue toxicity and internal effect concentrations of organic chemicals | journal = Integr Environ Assess Manag | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 28–49 |date=January 2011 | pmid = 21184568 | doi = 10.1002/ieam.100  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McKim JM, Schmieder PK, Carlson RW, Hunt EP | title = Use of respiratory-cardiovascular responses of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) in identifying acute toxicity syndromes in fish: Part 1. Pentachlorophenol, 2,4-dinitrophenol, tricaine methanesulfonate and 1-octanol | journal = Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry | year = 1987 | volume = 6 | pages = 295–312 | doi=10.1002/etc.5620060407}}&lt;/ref&gt; reason why they named the categories as ''[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes (FATS)|Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes]]'' (FATS). They proposed the FATS by assessing the [[behavioral]] and [[physiological]] responses of the fish when subjected to [[toxicity test]]s, such as [[locomotive]] activities, body [[color]], [[ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]] patterns, [[cough]] [[rate function|rate]], [[heart rate]], and others.&lt;ref name="escher02" /&gt;

It has been proposed that modes of toxic action could be estimated by developing a data set of critical body residues (CBR).&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; The CBR is the whole-body [[concentration]] of a chemical that is associated with a given adverse biological response&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt; and it is estimated using a [[partition coefficient]] and a [[bioconcentration]] factor. The whole-body residues are reasonable first [[approximations]] of the amount of chemical present at the toxic action site(s).&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; Because different modes of toxic action generally appear to be associated with different ranges of body residues,&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; modes of toxic action can then be separated into categories. However, it is unlikely that every chemical has the same mode of toxic action in every organism, so this [[Heart rate variability|variability]] should be considered.&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; The effects of [[mixture]] toxicity should be considered as well, even though mixture toxicity it's generally [[additive map|additive]],&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; chemicals with more than one mode of toxic action may contribute to toxicity.&lt;ref name="escher10" /&gt;

[[Scientific modeling|Modeling]] has become a common used tool to predict modes of toxic action in the last decade. The [[mathematical model|models]] are based in [[Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship]]s (QSARs), which are [[mathematical models]] that relate the [[biological activity]] of molecules to their [[chemical structure]]s and corresponding chemical and [[Physical chemistry|physicochemical]] properties.&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt; QSARs can then predict modes of toxic action of unknown compounds by comparing its characteristic toxicity profile and chemical structure to reference compounds with known toxicity profiles and chemical structures.&lt;ref name="escher02" /&gt; Russom and colleagues&lt;ref name="russom"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Russom CL, Bradbury SP, Broderius SJ, Hammermeister DE, Drummond RA | title = Predicting modes of toxic action from chemical structure: acute toxicity in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) | journal = Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry | year = 1997 | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 948–967 | doi=10.1002/etc.5620160514}}&lt;/ref&gt; were one of the first group of researchers being able to classify modes of toxic action with the use of QSARs; they classified 600 chemicals as narcotics. Even though QSARs are a useful tool for predicting modes of toxic action, chemicals having multiple modes of toxic action can obscure QSAR analyses. Therefore, these models are continuously being developed.

== Applications ==

=== Environmental risk assessment ===

The objective of environmental [[risk assessment]] is to protect the environment from adverse effects.&lt;ref name="escher02" /&gt; Researchers are further developing QSAR models with the ultimate goal providing a clear insight about a mode of toxic action, but also about what the actual target site is, the concentration of the chemical at this target site, and the interaction occurring at the target site,&lt;ref name="escher02" /&gt; as well as to predict the modes of toxic action in [[mixtures]]. Information on the mode of toxic action is crucial not only in understanding joint toxic effects and potential interactions between chemicals in mixtures, but also for developing assays for the evaluation of complex mixtures in the field.

=== Regulation ===

The combination of [[behavioral]] and [[physiological]] responses, CBR estimates, and chemical fate and [[bioaccumulation]] QSAR models can be a powerful regulatory tool&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; to address [[pollution]] and toxicity in areas where [[effluents]] are discharged.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21611">Biomaterials exhibit various degrees of compatibility with the harsh environment within a living organism. They need to be nonreactive chemically and physically with the body, as well as integrate when deposited into tissue.&lt;ref name=biomaterial&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00680113 |title=Biomaterials for abdominal wall hernia surgery and principles of their applications |year=1994 |last1=Amid |first1=P.

Often modifications to the surface of a biomaterial system are required to maximize performance. The surface can be modified in many ways, including plasma modification and applying coatings to the substrate. Surface modifications can be used to affect [[surface energy]], [[adhesion]], [[biocompatibility]], chemical inertness, lubricity, [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterility]], [[asepsis]], [[Thrombosis|thrombogenicity]], susceptibility to [[corrosion]], degradation, and [[hydrophile|hydrophilicity]].

== Background of Polymer Biomaterials ==

=== Polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) ===

[[polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] is a hydrophobic polymer composed of a carbon chain saturated with fluorine atoms. The fluorine-carbon bond is largely ionic, producing a strong dipole. The dipole prevents Teflon from being susceptible to [[Van der Waals force|Van der Waals forces]], so other materials will not stick to the surface.&lt;ref name=teflon&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/articles/material-matters/fluorinated-hyperbranched.html |title= Fluorinated Hyperbranched Polymers |last1= Mueller |first1= Anja |year= 2006 |work= Sigma Aldrich |accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teflon is commonly used to reduce friction in biomaterial applications such as in arterial grafts, catheters, and guide wire coatings.

=== Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) ===

[[File:Polyetherketon.svg|thumb|Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is a thermoplastic, semicrystalline polymer. The backbone consists of ether, ketone, and benzene groups]]
[[PEEK]] is a semicrystalline polymer composed of benzene, ketone, and ether groups. PEEK is known for having good physical properties including high wear resistance and low moisture absorption &lt;ref name=teflon2&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.boedeker.com/peek_p.htm |title= PEEK (PolyEtherEtherKetone) Specifications |year= 2013 |work= Boedeker Plastics |accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and has been used for biomedical implants due to its relative inertness inside of the human body.

== Plasma modification of biomaterials ==

Plasma modification is one way to alter the surface of biomaterials to enhance their properties. During plasma modification techniques, the surface is subjected to high levels of excited gases that alter the surface of the material. Plasma's are generally generated with a [[Radio frequency|radio frequency (RF)]] field. Additional methods include applying a large (~1KV) DC voltage across electrodes engulfed in a gas. The plasma is then used to expose the biomaterial surface, which can break or form chemical bonds. This is the result of physical collisions or chemical reactions of the excited gas molecules with the surface. This changes the surface chemistry and therefore surface energy of the material which affects the adhesion, biocompatibility, chemical inertness, lubricity, and sterilization of the material. The table below shows several biomaterial applications of plasma treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Loh |first=Ih-Houng |work=AST Technical Journal |title=Plasma Surface Modification In Biomedical Applications |url=http://www.astp.com/PDFs/PSBiomed.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514091530/http://www.astp.com/PDFs/PSBiomed.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surface Energy ===

The [[surface energy]] is equal to the sum of disrupted molecular bonds that occur at the interface between two different phases. Surface energy can be estimated by [[contact angle]] measurements using a version of the [[Young–Laplace equation]]:

&lt;math&gt; \gamma_{SV} - \gamma_{SL}= \gamma_{LV} cos\theta &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name=CA&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1021/ba-1964-0043.ch001 |chapter=Relation of the Equilibrium Contact Angle to Liquid and Solid Constitution |title=Contact Angle, Wettability, and Adhesion |series=Advances in Chemistry |year=1964 |last1=Zisman |first1=W. A. |isbn=0-8412-0044-0 |volume=43 |pages=1–51 |editor1-first=Frederick M. |editor1-last=Fowkes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{SV}&lt;/math&gt; is the surface tension at the interface of solid and vapor, &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{SL}&lt;/math&gt; is the surface tension at the interface of solid and liquid, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{LV}&lt;/math&gt; is the surface tension at the interface of liquid and vapor. Plasma modification techniques alter the surface of the material, and subsequently the surface energy. Changes in surface energy then alter the surface properties of the material.

=== Surface Functionalization ===

[[Surface modification]] techniques have been extensively researched for the application of adsorbing biological molecules. Surface functionalization can be performed by exposing surfaces to RF plasma. Many gases can be excited and used to functionalize surfaces for a wide variety of applications. Common techniques include using air plasma, oxygen plasma, and ammonia plasma as well as other exotic gases. Each gas can have varying effects on a substrate. These effects decay with time as reactions with molecules in air and contamination occur.

==== Plasma Treatment to Reduce Thrombogenesis ====

Ammonia plasma treatment can be used to attach amine functional groups.  These functional groups lock on to anticoagulants like Heparin decreasing thrombogenicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jbm.820270614 |title=Immobilization of high-affinity heparin oligosaccharides to radiofrequency plasma-modified polyethylene |year=1993 |last1=Yuan |first1=Shengmei |last2=Szakalas-Gratzl |first2=Gyongyi |last3=Ziats |first3=Nicholas P. |last4=Jacobsen |first4=Donald W. |last5=Kottke-Marchant |first5=Kandice |last6=Marchant |first6=Roger E. |journal=Journal of Biomedical Materials Research |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=811–9 |pmid=8408111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Covalent Immobilization by Gas Plasma RF Glow Discharge ====

[[Polysaccharide]]s have been used as [[thin film]] coatings for biomaterial surfaces. Polysaccharides are extremely hydrophilic and will have small [[contact angle]]s. They can be used for a wide range of applications due to their wide range of compositions. They can be used to reduce the [[adsorption]] of proteins to biomaterial surfaces. Additionally, they can be used as receptor sites, targeting specific biomolecules. This can be used to activate specific biological responses.

Covalent attachment to a substrate is necessary to immobilize polysaccharides, otherwise they will rapidly desorb in a biological environment. This can be a challenge due to the fact that the majority of biomaterials do not possess the surface properties to covalently attach polysaccharides. This can be achieved by the introduction of [[amine|amine groups]] by RF glow discharge plasma.  Gases used to form amine groups, including ammonia or n-heptylamine vapor, can be used to deposit a thin film coating containing surface amines. Polysaccharides must also be activated by oxidation of anhydroglucopyranoside subunits. This can be completed with sodium metaperiodate (NaIO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). This reaction converts anhydroglucopyranoside subunits to cyclic hemiacetal structures, which can be reacted with amine groups to form a Schiff base linkage (a carbon-nitrogen double bond). These linkages are unstable and will easily [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociate]]. Sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN) can be used as a stabilizer by reducing the linkages back to an amine.&lt;ref name=immobilization&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-9918(200001)29:1&lt;46::AID-SIA692&gt;3.0.CO;2-6 |title=Biomedical coatings by the covalent immobilization of polysaccharides onto gas-plasma-activated polymer surfaces |year=2000 |last1=Dai |first1=Liming |last2=Stjohn |first2=Heather A.

=== Surface Cleaning ===

There are many examples of contamination of biomaterials that are specific to the preparation or manufacturing process. Additionally, nearly all surfaces are prone to contamination of organic impurities in the air. Contamination layers are usually limited to a monolayer or less of atoms and are thus only detectable by surface analysis techniques, such as XPS. It is unknown whether this sort of contamination is harmful, yet it is still regarded as contamination and will most certainly affect surface properties.

Glow discharge plasma treatment is a technique that is used for cleaning contamination from biomaterial surfaces. Plasma treatment has been used for various biological evaluation studies to increase the surface energy of biomaterial surfaces, as well as cleaning.&lt;ref name=RFGD&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jbm.820290411|title=Effect of parallel surface microgrooves and surface energy on cell growth |year=1995 |last1=den Braber |first1=E.T. |last2=de Ruijter |first2=J.E. |last3=Smits |first3=H.T.J |last4=Ginsel |first4=L.A. |last5=von Recum |first5=A.F. |last6=Jamsen |first6=J.A. |journal=Journal of Biomedical Materials Research |volume=29 |pages=511–518 |pmid=7622536 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plasma treatment has also been proposed for [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]] of biomaterials for potential implants.&lt;ref name=glow&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-4636(199704)35:1&lt;49::AID-JBM6&gt;3.0.CO;2-M |title=Glow discharge plasma treatment for surface cleaning and modification of metallic biomaterials |year=1997 |last1=Aronsson |first1=B.-O. |last2=Lausmaa |first2=J. |last3=Kasemo |first3=B. |journal=Journal of Biomedical Materials Research |volume=35 |pages=49–73 |pmid=9104698}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Glow Plasma Discharge Schematic Polymer Chemistry.png|framed|center|Schematic of cleaning of a polymer surface using glow plasma discharge. Note the removal of adsorbed molecules and presence of dangling bonds.]]

== Modification of Biomaterials with Polymer Coatings ==

Another method of altering surface properties of biomaterials is to coat the surface. Coatings are used in many applications to improve biocompatibility and alter properties such as adsorption, lubricity, thrombogenicity, degradation, and corrosion.

=== Adhesion of Coatings ===

In general, the lower the surface tension of a liquid coating, the easier it will be to form a satisfactory wet film from it. The difference between the surface tension of a coating and the surface energy of a solid substrate to which a coating is applied affects how the liquid coating flows out over the substrate. It also affects the strength of the adhesive bond between the substrate and the dry film. If for instance, the surface tension of the coating is higher than the surface tension of the substrate, then the coating will not spread out and form a film. As the surface tension of the substrate is increased, it will reach a point to where the coating will successfully wet the substrate but have poor adhesion. Continuous increase in the coating surface tension will result in better wetting in film formation and better dry film adhesion.&lt;ref name=SurfaceTension&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pra-world.com/technical_services/laboratory/testing/surface-tension |title= Surface Tension, Surface Energy, Contact Angle and Adhesion |year= 2013 |work= Paint Research Association |accessdate= 22 May 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130109105050/http://www.pra-world.com/technical_services/laboratory/testing/surface-tension |archivedate= 9 January 2013 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically whether a liquid coating will spread across a solid substrate can be determined from the surface energies of the involved materials by using the following equation:

&lt;math&gt; S =  \gamma_{SA} + (\gamma_{CA} - \gamma_{SC}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=teflonse /&gt;

Where S is the coefficient of spreading,  &lt;math&gt; \gamma_{SA} &lt;/math&gt; is the surface energy of the substrate in air, &lt;math&gt; \gamma_{CA} &lt;/math&gt; is the surface energy of the liquid coating in air and &lt;math&gt; \gamma_{SC} &lt;/math&gt; is the interfacial energy between the coating and the substrate. If S is positive the liquid will cover the surface and the coating will adhere well. If S is negative the coating will not completely cover the surface, producing poor adhesion.

==== Corrosion Protection ====

Organic coatings are a common way to protect a metallic substrate from [[corrosion]]. Up until ~1950 it was thought that coatings act as a physical barrier which disallows moisture and oxygen to contact the metallic substrate and form a corrosion cell. This cannot be the case because the [[Permeation|permeability]] of paint films is very high. It has since been discovered that corrosion protection of steel depends greatly upon the adhesion of a noncorrosive coating when in the presence of water. With low adhesion, osmotic cells form underneath the coating with high enough pressures to form blisters, which expose more unprotected steel. Additional non-osmotic mechanisms have also been proposed. In either case, sufficient adhesion to resist displacement forces is required for corrosion protection.&lt;ref name=CoatingsBook&gt;{{cite book|author1=Z.W. Wicks |author2=Frank N. Jones |author3=S Peter Pappas |author4=Douglas A. Wicks | title = Organic Coatings Science and Technology | edition = 2nd expanded | location = New Jersey | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]] }}{{page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guide Wires ===

Guide wires are an example of an application for biomedical coatings. Guide wires are used in [[percutaneous coronary intervention|coronary angioplasty]] to correct the effects of [[coronary artery disease]], a disease that allows plaque build up on the walls of the arteries. The guide wire is threaded up through the femoral artery to the obstruction. The guide wire guides the balloon catheter to the obstruction where the catheter is inflated to press the plaque against the arterial walls.&lt;ref name=angioplasty&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/anatomyvideos/000096.htm |title= Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) |last1= Gandelman |first1= Glenn |date= March 22, 2013 |work= Medline Plus |accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guide wires are commonly made from stainless steel or [[Nickel Titanium|Nitinol]] and require polymer coatings as a surface modification to reduce friction in the arteries. The coating of the guide wire can affect the trackability, or the ability of the wire to move through the artery without kinking, the tactile feel, or the ability of the doctor to feel the guide wire's movements, and the thrombogenicity of the wire.

==== Hydrophilic Coatings ====

Hydrophilic coatings can reduce friction in the arteries by up to 83% when compared to bare wires due to their high surface energy.&lt;ref name=friction&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8485751 |year=1993 |last1=Schröder |first1=J |title=The mechanical properties of guidewires. Part III: Sliding friction |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=93–7 |journal=Cardiovascular and interventional radiology |doi=10.1007/BF02602986}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the hydrophilic coatings come into contact with bodily fluids they form a waxy surface texture that allows the wire to slide easily through the arteries. Guide wires with hydrophilic coatings have increased trackability and are not very thrombogenic; however the low coefficient of friction increases the risk of the wire slipping and perforating the artery.&lt;ref name=techniques&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Andrejs |last1=Erglis |first2=Inga |last2=Narbute |first3=Dace |last3=Sondore |first4=Alona |last4=Grave |first5=Sanda |last5=Jegere |title=Tools &amp; Techniques: coronary guidewires  |journal=EuroIntervention |url=http://www.pcronline.com/eurointervention/tools-and-techniques/coronary-guidewires/download_pdf.php |pmid=20542813 |year=2010 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=168–9 |doi=10.4244/eijv6i1a24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hydrophobic Coatings ====

Teflon and [[Silicone]] are commonly used [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] coatings for coronary guide wires. Hydrophobic coatings have a lower surface energy and reduce friction in the arteries by up to 48%.&lt;ref name=friction/&gt;  Hydrophobic coatings do not need to be in contact with fluids to form a slippery texture. Hydrophobic coatings maintain tactile sensation in the artery, giving doctors full control of the wire at all times and reducing the risk of perforation; though, the coatings are more thrombogenic than hydrophilic coatings.&lt;ref name=techniques/&gt; The thrombogenicity is due to the proteins in the blood adapting to the hydrophobic environment when they adhere to the coating. This causes an irreversible change for the protein, and the protein remains stuck to the coating allowing for a blood clot to form.&lt;ref name=thrombo&gt;{{cite journal |first=Denis |last=Labarre |title=Improving blood compatibility of polymeric surfaces |journal=Trends in Biomaterials &amp; Artificial Organs |year=2001 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=1–3 |url=http://www.biomaterials.org.in/ojs/index.php/tibao/article/view/5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Magnetic Resonance Compatible Guide Wires ====

Using an [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging|MRI]] to image the guide wire during use would have an advantage over using x-rays because the surrounding tissue can be examined while the guide wire is advanced. Because most guide wires' core materials are stainless steel they are not capable of being imaged with an MRI. Nitinol wires are not magnetic and could potentially be imaged, but in practice the conductive nitinol heats up under the magnetic radiation which would damage surrounding tissues. An alternative that is being examined is to replace contemporary guide wires with PEEK cores, coated with iron particle embedded synthetic polymers.&lt;ref name=MRI&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jmri.20486 |title=A polymer-based MR-compatible guidewire: A study to explore new prospects for interventional peripheral magnetic resonance angiography (ipMRA) |year=2006 |last1=Mekle |first1=Ralf |last2=Hofmann |first2=Eugen |last3=Scheffler |first3=Klaus |last4=Bilecen |first4=Deniz |journal=Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=145–55 |pmid=16374877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6370">'''Phytogeomorphology''' is the study of how [[terrain]] features affect plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, J.A., Mitchell, C.W., 1985. Phytogeomorphology. ''Wiley''.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the subject of a [[treatise]] by Howard and Mitchell in 1985, who were considering the growth and varietal temporal and spatial variability found in forests, but recognized that their work also had application to [[agriculture|farming]], and the relatively new science (at that time) of [[precision agriculture]].  The premise of Howard and Mitchell is that [[landform]]s, or features of the land's 3D [[topography]] significantly affect how and where plants (or trees in their case) grow.  Since that time, the ability to map and classify landform shapes and features has increased greatly.  The advent of [[GPS]] has made it possible to map almost any variable one might wish to measure.  Thus, a very increased awareness of the spatial variability of the environment that plants grow in has arisen.  The development of technology like airborne [[LiDAR]] has enabled the detailed measurement of landform features to better than sub-meter, and when combined with [[RTK-GPS]] (accuracies to 1mm) enables the creation of very accurate maps of where these features are.  Comparison of these landform maps with mapping of variables related to crop or plant growth show a strong correlation (see below for examples and references for precision agriculture).

==Phytogeomorphology and Precision Agriculture==
While phytogeomorphology studies the relationship between plants and terrain attributes in general (see Howard et al., (1985)), it can also apply to [[precision agriculture]] by studying crop growth temporal and spatial variability within farm fields.  There is already a volume of work, although they don't use the term phytogeomorphology specifically, that considers farm field terrain attributes as affecting crop yield and growth, Moore et al. (1991)&lt;ref&gt;Moore, I.D., Grayson, R.B., Ladson, A.R., 1991. Digital Terrain Modelling: A review of hydrological, geomorphological, and biological applications. ''Hydrological Processes'', Vol. 5, 3-30&lt;/ref&gt; provide an early overview of the application of terrain features to precision agriculture, but one of the earliest references to this phenomenon in farming is that of Whittaker in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker, R.H. 1967. Gradient analysis of vegetation, ''Biological Reviews'', 42, 207-264&lt;/ref&gt; More recent work includes a six-year study of temporal and spatial yield stability over 11 years (Kaspar et al., (2003), and references therein),&lt;ref&gt;Kaspar, T.C, Colvin, T.S., Jaynes, B., Karlen, D.L., James, D.E, Meek, D.W., 2003. Relationship between six years of corn yields and terrain attributes. ''Precision Agriculture'', 4, 87-101.&lt;/ref&gt; and a detailed study of the same on a small patch farm in Portugal (and references therein).&lt;ref&gt;Marquas da Silva, J.R., and Silva, L.L., 2008. Evaluation of the relationship between maize yield spatial and temporal variability and different topographic attributes. ''Biosystems Engineering'', 101, 183-190.&lt;/ref&gt;  This variability can be exploited to produce higher yields and reduce the environmental impact of farming - consequently returning a higher profit to the farmer in terms of higher overall yields and lesser amounts of inputs.  The new science of Sustainable Intensification of Agriculture&lt;ref&gt;Garnett, T. et al., 2013. Sustainable Intensification in Agriculture: Premise and Policies. ''Science'', Vol. 341, 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt; which is addressing the need for higher yields from existing fields can be fulfilled by some of the practical applications of phytogeomorphology applied to precision agriculture.

Work in this area has been happening for some years (see Reuter et al., (2005),&lt;ref&gt;Reuter, H.I., Giebel, A., Wendroth, O., 2005. Can Landform Stratification Improve Our Understanding of Crop Yield Variability. ''Precision Agriculture'', 6, 521-537.&lt;/ref&gt; Marquas de Silva et al., (2008), and especially Moore et al., (1991)), but it is slow and sometimes tedious work that necessarily involves multiple years of data, very specialized software tools, and long compute times to produce the resulting maps.

==Phytogeomorphologically defined Management Zones==
Typically, the objective of precision agriculture is to divide the farm field into distinct [[management zones]] based on [[Crop yield|yield]] performance at each point in the field. 'Variable rate technology' is a relatively new term in farming technology that refers to [[Broadcast spreader|spreader]]s, [[seeder]]s, [[sprayer]]s, etc. that are able to adjust their rates of flow on the fly.  The idea is to create a 'recipe map' for variable rate farm machinery to deliver the exact quantity of amendments required at that location (within that zone of the field).  The literature is divided on how to properly define management zones.

In the geomorphological approach to defining management zones it is found that topography aids in at least partially defining how much yield comes from which part of the field.  This is true in fields where there are permanently limiting characteristics to parts of the field, but not true in fields where the growth potential is the same all over the field (Blackmore et al., (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Blackmore, S., Godwin, R.J., Fountas, S., 2003. The Analysis of Spatial and Temporal Trends in Yield Map Data over Six Years. ''Biosystems Engineering'', 84(4), 455-466&lt;/ref&gt;). It can be shown that an index map of yield (shows areas of consistent over-performance of yield and areas of consistent under-performance) correlates well with a landform classification map (personal communication, Aspinall (2011)&lt;ref&gt;Aspinall, D., 2011. Ontario Ministry of Agriculture and Food (OMAF).&lt;/ref&gt;).  Landforms can be classified a number of ways, but the simplest to use software tool is [[LandMapR]] (MacMillan (2003)&lt;ref&gt;MacMillan, R.A., VanDeusen, A.A., 2003. The LandMapR User's Guide. Self-Published&lt;/ref&gt;).  An early version of the LandMapR software is available through the [[Opengeomorphometry project]] hosted under the [[Google Code project]].

'''Trabecular cartilages''' ('''trabeculae cranii''', sometimes simply '''trabeculae''', '''prechordal cartilages''') are paired, rod-shaped cartilages, which develop in the [[head]] of the [[vertebrate]] [[embryo]]. They are the primordia of the anterior part of the [[Base of skull|cranial base]], and are derived from the [[cranial neural crest|cranial neural crest cells]].

==Structure==
[[File:Shark Lacerta deBeer1937.jpg|thumb|330px|Morphogenesis of neurocranium (shark and lizard).]]
The trabecular cartilages generally appear as a paired, rod-shaped cartilages at the ventral side of the [[forebrain]] and lateral side of the [[adenohypophysis]] in the vertebrate embryo. During development, their anterior ends fuse and form the ''trabecula communis''. Their posterior ends fuse with the caudal-most [[parachordal cartilages]].

===Development===
Most [[skeletons]] are of [[mesodermal]] origin in vertebrates. Especially axial skeletal elements, such as the vertebrae, are derived from the paraxial mesoderm (e.g., [[somites]]), which is regulated by molecular signals from the [[notochord]]. Trabecular cartilages, however, originate from the neural crest, and since they are located anterior to the rostral tip of the notochord,&lt;ref&gt;their derivatives are called the ''prechordal cranium'' (Couly et al., 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; they cannot receive signals from the notochord. Due to these specialisations, and their essential role in cranial development, many comparative morphologists and embryologists have argued their developmental or evolutionary origins. The general theory is that the trabecular cartilage is derived from the neural crest mesenchyme which fills anterior to the mandibular arch (premandibular domain).

==Other animals==
===Lamprey===
As clearly seen in the [[lamprey]], [[Cyclostome]] also has a pair of cartilaginous rods in the embryonic head which is similar to the trabecular cartilages in jawed vertebrates.
However, in 1916, [[Alexej Nikolajevich Sewertzoff]] pointed out that the cranial base of the lamprey is exclusively originated from the paraxial mesoderm. Then in 1948, [[:de:Alf Johnels|Alf Johnels]] reported the detail of the skeletogenesis of the lamprey, and showed that the “trabecular cartilages” in lamprey appear just beside the notochord, in a similar position to the parachordal cartilages in jawed vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;Johnels AG (1948) On the development and morphology of the skeleton of the head of Petromyzon. Acta Zool 29: 139-279&lt;/ref&gt; Recent experimental studies also showed that the cartilages are derived from the head mesoderm.&lt;ref&gt;Kuratani S ''et al''., (2004) Developmental fate of the mandibular mesoderm in the lamprey, Lethenteron japonicum: comparative morphology and development of the gnathostome jaw with special reference to the nature of trabecula cranii. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev. Evol.). 302B, 458-468&lt;/ref&gt; The “trabecular cartilages” in the Cyclostome is no longer considered to be the homologue of the trabecular in the jawed vertebrates: the (true) trabecular cartilages were firstly acquired in the Gnathostome lineage.

==History==
{{refimprove-section|date=August 2017}}
The trabecular cartilages were first described in the [[grass snake]] by [[:de:Martin Heinrich Rathke|Martin Heinrich Rathke]] at 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Entwicklungsgeschichte der Natter. Konigsberg (1839)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874, [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] suggested that the trabecular cartilages are a modified part of the [[splanchnocranium]]: they arose as the serial homologues of the [[pharyngeal arches]].{{fact|date=August 2017}}

The vertebrate [[jaw]] is generally thought to be the modification of the [[mandibular arch]] (1st pharyngeal arch). Since the trabecular cartilages appear anterior to the mandibular arch, if the trabecular cartilages are serial homologues of the pharyngeal arches, ancestral vertebrates should possess more than one pharyngeal arch (so-called "premandibular arches") anterior to the mandibular arch. The existence of premandibular arch(es) has been accepted by many comparative embryologists and morphologists (e.g., [[Edwin Stephen Goodrich]], [[Gavin de Beer]]). Moreover, [[:de: Erik Stensio|Erik Stensio]] reported premandibular arches and the corresponding branchiomeric nerves by the reconstruction of the [[Osteostraci|Osteostracans]] (e.g., ''[[Cephalaspis]]''; recently this arch was reinterpreted as the mandibular arch)

However, the existence of the premandibular arch(es) has been rejected, and the trabecular cartilages are no longer assumed to be one of the pharyngeal arches.

'''Endogenous''' substances and processes are those that originate from within an [[organism]], [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], or [[Cell (biology)|cell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=endogenous |title=Endogenous &amp;#124; Define Endogenous at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Endogenous viral element]]s are [[Nucleic acid sequence|DNA sequences]] derived from [[virus]]es that are ancestrally inserted into the [[genome]]s of [[germ cell]]s. These sequences, which may be fragments of viruses or entire viral genomes ([[provirus|proviruses]]), can persist in the [[germline]], being passed on from one generation to the next as host [[allele]]s.

Endogenous processes include [[senescence]], the [[menstrual cycle]] and the self-sustained [[circadian rhythm]]s of plants and animals.

In some [[biology|biological]] systems, endogeneity pertains to the recipient of [[DNA]] (usually in [[prokaryote]]s). However, because of [[homeostasis]], discerning between internal and external influences is often difficult.

Endogenous [[transcription factor]]s are those manufactured by the cell, as distinguished from cloned transcription factors.

==Understanding inverted repeats==

===Example of an inverted repeat===
[[File:Inverted-Repeat.gif|thumb|500px|left|The 5 base-pair sequence on the left is "repeated" and "inverted" to form sequence on the right.]]

Beginning with this initial sequence:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {{color|blue|5'-TTACG-3'}}

The complement created by base pairing is:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {{color|green|3'-AATGC-5'}}

The reverse complement is:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {{color|green|5'-CGTAA-3'}}

And, the inverted repeat sequence is:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {{color|blue|5'---TTACGnnnnnn}}{{color|green|CGTAA---3'}}

"nnnnnn" represents any number of intervening nucleotides.

===Direct repeat vs. inverted repeat===
A well-defined direct repeat is that which has a duplicated sequence as follows:&lt;ref name=Bissler&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bissler|first=JJ|title=DNA inverted repeats and human disease.|journal=Frontiers in Bioscience|date=Mar 27, 1998|volume=3|pages=d408-18|pmid=9516381|doi=10.2741/a284}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:::{{color|blue|5´ '''ACATACA'''ACATACA 3´}}
:::{{color|green|3´ '''TGTATGT'''TGTATGT 5´}}
The nucleotide sequence written in bold characters signifies the repeated sequence.&lt;ref name=Bissler&gt;{{cite journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistically, a typical direct repeat is comparable to saying "bye-bye".&lt;ref name=Bissler&gt;{{cite journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is similarity between direct and inverted repeat, or else a palindrome, with the exception of the second half of the inverted repeat positioned in the complementary strand as follows:&lt;ref name=Bissler&gt;{{cite journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:::{{color|blue|5´ '''ACATACG'''CGTATGT 3´}}
:::{{color|green|3´ TGTATGC'''GCATACA''' 5´}}
The last repeats suggest that palindromes can be related linguistically to a string of characters that reads the same in both directions, such as "level". In all, repeated sequence without the [[complementarity (molecular biology)|reverse complement]] and without inversion, is a [[direct repeat]].&lt;ref name=Ussery2008 /&gt; Based on the same initial sequence discussed above in the section titled "understanding inverted repeats", a direct repeat would be: {{color|blue|5' TTACGnnnnnnTTACG 3'}}
--&gt;

===Vs. direct repeat===
A direct repeat occurs when a sequence is repeated with the same pattern downstream.&lt;ref name=Ussery2008 /&gt;  There is no inversion and no reverse complement associated with a direct repeat. The nucleotide sequence written in bold characters signifies the repeated sequence. It may or may not have intervening nucleotides.
:::{{color|blue |5´ '''TTACG'''nnnnnnTTACG 3´}}
:::{{color|green|3´ '''AATGC'''nnnnnnAATGC 5´}}
Linguistically, a typical direct repeat is comparable to saying "bye-bye".&lt;ref name=Ussery2008 /&gt;

===Vs. palindrome===
An inverted repeat sequence with no intervening nucleotides between the initial sequence and its downstream [[complementarity (molecular biology)|reverse complement]] is a [[palindromic sequence|palindrome]].&lt;ref name=Ussery2008 /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; EXAMPLE:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Step 1: start with an inverted repeat: {{color|blue|5' TTACGnnnnnnCGTAA 3'}}&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Step 2: remove intervening nucleotides: {{color|blue|5' TTACGCGTAA 3'}}&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; This resulting sequence is palindromic because it is the reverse complement of itself.&lt;ref name=Ussery2008 /&gt;
:::{{color|blue|5' TTACGCGTAA 3'}} &amp;nbsp; test sequence (from Step 2 with intervening nucleotides removed)
:::{{color|green|3' AATGCGCATT 5'}} &amp;nbsp; complement of test sequence
:::{{color|blue|5' TTACGCGTAA 3'}} &amp;nbsp; reverse complement &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; This is the same as the test sequence above, and thus, it is a palindrome.

===Origin of inverted repeats===

--&gt;

===Conditions that favor synthesis===
The diverse genome-wide repeats are derived from [[transposable element]]s, which are now understood to "jump" about different genomic locations, without transferring their original copies.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;{{cite book|last=School|first=James D. Watson, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Tania A. Baker, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stephen P.

Harrison, Harvard Medical|title=Molecular biology of the gene|publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing Company|location=Boston|isbn=9780321762436|edition=Seventh|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent shuttling of the same sequences over numerous generations ensures their multiplicity throughout the genome.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; The limited [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] of the sequences between two distinct sequence elements known as [[Site-specific recombination|conservative site-specific recombination]] (CSSR) results in inversions of the DNA segment, based on the arrangement of the recombination recognition sequences on the donor DNA and recipient DNA.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Again, the orientation of two of the recombining sites within the donor DNA molecule relative to the asymmetry of the intervening DNA cleavage sequences, known as the crossover region, is pivotal to the formation of either inverted repeats or direct repeats.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Thus, recombination occurring at a pair of inverted sites will invert the DNA sequence between the two sites.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; &lt;!--Very stable chromosomes have been observed with a comparatively fewer number of inverted repeats than direct repeats, suggesting a relationship between the stability of and the number of  repeats.--&gt;Very stable chromosomes have been observed with comparatively fewer numbers of inverted repeats than direct repeats, suggesting a relationship between chromosome stability and the number of repeats.&lt;ref name=Achaz&gt;{{cite journal|last=Achaz|first=G|author2=Coissac, E |author3=Netter, P |author4= Rocha, EP |title=Associations between inverted repeats and the structural evolution of bacterial genomes|journal=Genetics|date=August 2003|volume=164|issue=4|pages=1279–89|pmid=12930739|pmc=1462642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Most common biological functions using Inverted Repeats===
:This section is "under construction" and will be completed by mid-December.

===Regions where presence is obligatory===
Terminal inverted repeats have been observed in the DNA of various eukaryotic transposons, even though their source remains unknown.&lt;ref name=Zhang&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=HH|author2=Xu, HE |author3=Shen, YH |author4=Han, MJ |author5= Zhang, Z |title=The Origin and Evolution of Six Miniature Inverted-Repeat Transposable Elements in Bombyx mori and Rhodnius prolixus|journal=Genome Biology and Evolution|date=January 2013|volume=5|issue=11|pages=2020–31|pmid=24115603|doi=10.1093/gbe/evt153 |pmc=3845634}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inverted repeats are principally found at the origins of replication of cell organism and organelles that range from phage plasmids, mitochondria, and eukaryotic viruses to mammalian cells.&lt;ref name=Pearson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearson|first=CE|author2=Zorbas, H |author3=Price, GB |author4= Zannis-Hadjopoulos, M |title=Inverted repeats, stem-loops, and cruciforms: significance for initiation of DNA replication|journal=Journal of Cellular Biochemistry|date=October 1996|volume=63|issue=1|pages=1–22|pmid=8891900|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-4644(199610)63:1&lt;1::AID-JCB1&gt;3.0.CO;2-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The replication origins of the phage G4 and other related phages comprise a segment of nearly 139 nucleotide bases that include three inverted repeats that are essential for replication priming.&lt;ref name=Pearson /&gt;

===In the genome===
To a large extent, portions of nucleotide repeats are quite often observed as part of rare DNA combinations.&lt;ref name=Heringa /&gt; The three main repeats which are largely found in particular DNA constructs include the closely precise homopurine-homopyrimidine inverted repeats, which is otherwise referred to as H palindromes, a common occurrence in triple helical H conformations that may comprise either the TAT or CGC nucleotide triads. The others could be described as long inverted repeats having the tendency to produce hairpins and cruciform, and finally direct tandem repeats, which commonly exist in structures described as slipped-loop, cruciform and left-handed Z-DNA.&lt;ref name=Heringa /&gt;

===Common in different organisms===
Past studies suggest that repeats are a common feature of [[eukaryotes]] unlike the [[prokaryotes]] and [[archaea]].&lt;ref name=Heringa&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heringa|first=J|title=Detection of internal repeats: how common are they?|journal=Current Opinion in Structural Biology|date=June 1998|volume=8|issue=3|pages=338–45|pmid=9666330|doi=10.1016/S0959-440X(98)80068-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports suggest that irrespective of the comparative shortage of repeat elements in prokaryotic genomes, they nevertheless contain hundreds or even thousands of large repeats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Treangen|first=TJ|author2=Abraham, AL |author3=Touchon, M |author4= Rocha, EP |title=Genesis, effects and fates of repeats in prokaryotic genomes|journal=FEMS Microbiology Reviews|date=May 2009|volume=33|issue=3|pages=539–71|pmid=19396957|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2009.00169.x|url=https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article-pdf/33/3/539/18141891/33-3-539.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Current genomic analysis seem to suggest the existence of a large excess of perfect inverted repeats in many prokaryotic genomes as compared to eukaryotic genomes.&lt;ref name=Ladoukakis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ladoukakis|first=ED|author2=Eyre-Walker, A|title=The excess of small inverted repeats in prokaryotes|journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution|date=September 2008|volume=67|issue=3|pages=291–300|pmid=18696026|doi=10.1007/s00239-008-9151-z|url=http://www.lifesci.susx.ac.uk/home/Adam_Eyre-Walker/Website/Publications_files/LadoukakisJME08.pdf|bibcode=2008JMolE..67..291L|citeseerx=10.1.1.578.7466}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently (2017) was found that inverted repeats are present in DNA of all mitochondrial and plastid genomes sequenced so far and are enriched especially in important regulatory regions like replication origin and D-loops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cechova|first=J|author2=Lysek, J |author3=Bartas, M |author4= Brazda, V |title=Complex analyses of inverted repeats in mitochondrial genomes revealed their importance and variability|journal=Bioinformatics|date=November 2017|volume=34|issue=7|pages=1081–1085|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btx729|pmid=29126205|pmc=6030915}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brazda|first=V|author2=Lysek, J |author3=Bartas, M |author4= Fojta, M |title=Complex Analyses of Short Inverted Repeats in All Sequenced Chloroplast DNAs|journal=BioMed Research International|date=July 2018|volume=2018|pages=1097018|doi=10.1155/2018/1097018|pmid=30140690|pmc=6081594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For quantification and comparison of inverted repeats between several species, namely on archaea, see &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hosseini|first=M|author2=Pratas, D |author3=Pinho, AJ |title=On the Role of Inverted Repeats in DNA Sequence Similarity|journal=11th International Conference on Practical Applications of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics.

===Inverted repeats in pseudoknots===
[[Pseudoknot]]s are common structural motifs found in RNA.  They are formed by two nested [[stem-loop]]s such that the stem of one structure is formed from the loop of the other.  There are multiple folding [[topology|topologies]] among pseudoknots and great variation in loop lengths, making them a structurally diverse group.&lt;ref name=Staple&gt;{{cite journal|last=Staple|first=DW|author2=Butcher, SE|title=Pseudoknots: RNA structures with diverse functions.|journal=PLoS Biology|date=June 2005|volume=3|issue=6|pages=e213|pmid=15941360|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030213|pmc=1149493}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inverted repeats are a key component of pseudoknots as can be seen in the illustration of a naturally occurring pseudoknot found in the human [[telomerase RNA component]].&lt;ref name=chen-greider&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=JL|author2=Greider, CW|title=Functional analysis of the pseudoknot structure in human telomerase RNA.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Jun 7, 2005|volume=102|issue=23|pages=8080–5; discussion 8077–9|pmid=15849264|doi=10.1073/pnas.0502259102|pmc=1149427|bibcode=2005PNAS..102.8080C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four different sets of inverted repeats are involved in this structure.  Sets 1 and 2 are the stem of stem-loop A and are part of the loop for stem-loop B.  Similarly, sets 3 and 4 are the stem for stem-loop B and are part of the loop for stem-loop A.

Pseudoknots play a number of different roles in biology.  The telomerase pseudoknot in the illustration is critical to that enzyme's activity.&lt;ref name=chen-greider /&gt;  The [[ribozyme]] for the [[Hepatitis D|''hepatitis delta virus (HDV)'']] folds into a double-pseudoknot structure and self-cleaves its circular genome to produce a single-genome-length RNA.  Pseudoknots also play a role in programmed [[ribosomal frameshift]]ing found in some viruses and required in the replication of [[retroviruses]].&lt;ref name=Staple /&gt;{{Clear}}

===In riboswitches===
Inverted repeats play an important role in [[riboswitch]]es, which are RNA regulatory elements that control the expression of genes that produce the mRNA, of which they are part.&lt;ref name="Watson"/&gt;  A simplified example of the [[flavin mononucleotide]] (FMN) riboswitch is shown in the illustration. This riboswitch exists in the [[mRNA]] transcript and has several [[stem-loop]] structures upstream from the [[coding region]].  However, only the key stem-loops are shown in the illustration, which has been greatly simplified to help show the role of the inverted repeats.  There are multiple inverted repeats in this riboswitch as indicated in green (yellow background) and blue (orange background). [[File:Ribo100r.gif|thumb|800 px|left]]
{{Clear}}
In the absence of FMN, the Anti-termination structure is the preferred [[Conformation activity relationship|conformation]] for the mRNA transcript. It is created by base-pairing of the inverted repeat region circled in red.  When FMN is present, it may bind to the loop and prevent formation of the Anti-termination structure.  This allows two different sets of inverted repeats to base-pair and form the Termination structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winkler|first=WC|author2=Cohen-Chalamish, S |author3=Breaker, RR |title=An mRNA structure that controls gene expression by binding FMN.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Dec 10, 2002|volume=99|issue=25|pages=15908–13|pmid=12456892|doi=10.1073/pnas.212628899|pmc=138538|bibcode=2002PNAS...9915908W}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stem-loop on the 3' end is a [[Terminator (genetics)|transcriptional terminator]] because the sequence immediately following it is a string of uracils (U).  If this stem-loop forms (due to the presence of FMN) as the growing RNA strand emerges from the [[RNA polymerase]] complex, it will create enough structural tension to cause the RNA strand to dissociate and thus terminate transcription.  The dissociation occurs easily because the base-pairing between the U's in the RNA and the A's in the template strand are the weakest of all base-pairings.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;  Thus, at higher concentration levels, FMN down-regulates its own transcription by increasing the formation of the termination structure.

==Mutations and disease==
Inverted repeats are often described as "hotspots" of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomic instability.&lt;ref name=Voineagu&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mirkin|first=I|author2=Narayanan, V |author3=Lobachev, KS |author4= Mirkin, SM |title=Replication stalling at unstable inverted repeats: interplay between DNA hairpins and fork stabilizing proteins|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Jul 22, 2008|volume=105|issue=29|pages=9936–41|pmid=18632578|bibcode=2008PNAS..105.9936V|doi=10.1073/pnas.0804510105|pmc=2481305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long inverted repeats are deemed to greatly influence the stability of the genome of various organisms.&lt;ref name=Zhao&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stormo|first=G|author2=Chang, KY |author3=Varley, K |author4= Stormo, GD |title=Evidence for active maintenance of inverted repeat structures identified by a comparative genomic approach|journal=PLoS ONE|date=Feb 28, 2007|volume=2|issue=2|pages=e262|pmid=17327921|bibcode=2007PLoSO...2..262Z|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000262|pmc=1803023|editor1-last=Hall|editor1-first=Neil}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is exemplified in ''E. coli'', where genomic sequences with long inverted repeats are seldom replicated, but rather deleted with rapidity.&lt;ref name=Zhao /&gt; Again, the long inverted repeats observed in yeast greatly favor recombination within the same and adjacent chromosomes, resulting in an equally very high rate of deletion.&lt;ref name=Zhao /&gt; Finally, a very high rate of deletion and recombination were also observed in mammalian chromosomes regions with inverted repeats.&lt;ref name=Zhao /&gt; Reported differences in the stability of genomes of interrelated organisms are always an indication of a disparity in inverted repeats.&lt;ref name=Achaz /&gt; The instability results from the tendency of inverted repeats to fold into hairpin- or cruciform-like DNA structures. These special structures can hinder or confuse DNA replication and other genomic activities.&lt;ref name=Voineagu /&gt; Thus, inverted repeats lead to special configurations in both [[RNA]] and [[DNA]] that can ultimately cause [[mutation]]s and [[disease]].&lt;ref name=bissler&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bissler|first=JJ|title=DNA inverted repeats and human disease|journal=Frontiers in Bioscience|date=Mar 27, 1998|volume=3|issue=4|pages=d408–18|pmid=9516381|doi=10.2741/a284}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:DNA palindrome.svg|thumb|600 px|left|Inverted repeat changing to/from an extruded cruciform. &amp;nbsp; A: Inverted Repeat Sequences; &amp;nbsp; B: Loop; &amp;nbsp; C: Stem with base pairing of the inverted repeat sequences]]
The illustration shows an inverted repeat undergoing cruciform extrusion. DNA in the region of the inverted repeat unwinds and then recombines, forming a four-way junction with two [[stem-loop]] structures. The cruciform structure occurs because the inverted repeat sequences self-pair to each other on their own strand.&lt;ref name=ramreddy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramreddy|first=T|author2=Sachidanandam, R |author3=Strick, TR |title=Real-time detection of cruciform extrusion by single-molecule DNA nanomanipulation|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=May 2011|volume=39|issue=10|pages=4275–83|pmid=21266478|doi=10.1093/nar/gkr008|pmc=3105387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extruded cruciforms can lead to [[frameshift mutation]]s when a DNA sequence has inverted repeats in the form of a [[palindromic sequence|palindrome]] combined with regions of [[direct repeat]]s on either side. During [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]], slippage and partial dissociation of the polymerase from the template strand can lead to both [[deletion (genetics)|deletion]] and [[insertion (genetics)|insertion]] mutations.&lt;ref name=bissler /&gt;  Deletion occurs when a portion of the unwound [[template strand]] forms a stem-loop that gets "skipped" by the transcription machinery. Insertion occurs when a stem-loop forms in a dissociated portion of the nascent (newly synthesized) strand causing a portion of the template strand to be transcribed twice.&lt;ref name=bissler /&gt;

Imperfect inverted repeats can lead to [[mutation]]s through intrastrand and interstrand switching.&lt;ref name=bissler /&gt;  The [[antithrombin]] III gene's coding region is an example of an imperfect inverted repeat as shown in the figure on the right.
The [[stem-loop]] structure forms with a bump at the bottom because the G and T do not pair up. A strand switch event could result in the G (in the bump) being replaced by an A which removes the "imperfection" in the inverted repeat and provides a stronger stem-loop structure. However, the replacement also creates a [[point mutation]] converting the GCA codon to ACA. If the strand switch event is followed by a second round of [[DNA replication]], the mutation may become fixed in the [[genome]] and lead to disease. Specifically, the [[missense mutation]] would lead to a defective gene and a deficiency in antithrombin which could result in the development of [[venous thromboembolism]] (blood clots within a vein).&lt;ref name=bissler /&gt;

The addition of the T creates a [[base-pairing]] "match up" with the adenine (A) that was previously a "bump" on the left side of the stem. While this addition makes the stem stronger and perfects the inverted repeat, it also creates a [[frameshift mutation]] in the nucleotide sequence which alters the [[reading frame]] and will result in an incorrect expression of the gene.&lt;ref name=bissler /&gt;

'''Parabiosis''', meaning "living beside", is a technical term in various contexts in fields of study related to [[ecology]] and [[physiology]]. It accordingly has been defined independently in at least three disciplines, namely experimental or medical physiology, the ecology of inactive physiological states, and the ecology of certain classes of social species that share nests.

==Etymology==
Parabiosis derives most directly from [[new Latin]],&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/parabiosis?show=0&amp;t=1386697129]&lt;/ref&gt; but the Latin in turn derives from two classical Greek roots. The first is ''παρά'' (''para'') for "beside" or "next to". In modern etymology, this root appears in various senses, such as "close to", "outside of", and "different".

* In the physiological sense of "parabiosis", "para" apparently was intended to mean "next to".
* In describing transiently inactive physiological states, "para" apparently meant "outside of".
* In ecological usage, the word was coined by the entomologist [[Auguste-Henri Forel]] as an analogue to "[[symbiosis]]", also in the sense of "next to". However, in this case, the emphasis was in contrast to "together" ("sym-").

The second classical Greek root from which the Latin derives is ''βίος'' (''bios''), meaning "life".

==Parabiotic experiments==
[[File:The Biological bulletin (19755290053).jpg|thumb|Left: A headless [[Cecropia Moth]] joined with a pupa of the [[polyphemus moth|Polyphemus silkworm]]. Right: The abdomen of a Cecropia moth joined with a Cecropia pupa]]
In the field of experimental physiology, parabiosis is a class of techniques in which two living organisms are joined together surgically and develop single, shared physiological systems, such as a shared circulatory system.&lt;ref&gt;Biju Parekkadan &amp; Martin L. Yarmush (eds). Stem Cell Bioengineering. Chapter 10: "Parabiosis in aging research and regenerative medicine" Artech House 2009 {{ISBN|978-1596934023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zarrow, M. X.  Experimental Endocrinology: A Sourcebook of Basic Techniques Academic Press 1964 {{ISBN|978-0124143609}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through surgically connecting two animals, researchers can prove that the feedback system in one animal is circulated and affects the second animal via blood and plasma exchange. Total blood volume is exchanged approximately ten times per day in rat experiments using parabiosis. One limitation of the experiments is that [[outbreed|outbred]] rats cannot be used because it can lead to a significant loss of pairs due to intoxication of the blood supply from a dissimilar rat.&lt;ref name="Harris, R. B. S. 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = R. B. S. | year = 2013 | title = Is Leptin the Parabiotic "Satiety" Factor ? Past and Present Interpretations | url = | journal = Appetite | volume = 61 | issue = 1| pages = 111–118 | doi = 10.1016/j.appet.2012.08.006 | pmc = 3749919 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1800s, parabiotic experiments were pioneered by [[Paul Bert]]. He postulated that surgically connected animals could share a circulatory system. Bert was awarded the Prize of Experimental Physiology of the French Academy of Science in 1866 for his discoveries. Parabiotic experiments were scarcely revisited until the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Eggel, A. 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eggel | first1 = A. | last2 = Wyss-Coray | first2 = T. | year = 2014 | title = Parabiosis for the study of age-related chronic disease | url = | journal = Swiss Medical Weekly | volume = 144 | issue = | page = 13914 | doi = 10.4414/smw.2014.13914|pmid=24496774|pmc=4082987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the parabiotic experiments since 1950 involve research regarding metabolism. One of these experiments was published in 1959 by G. R. Hervey in the ''[[The Journal of Physiology|Journal of Physiology]]''. This experiment was to support the theory that damage to the [[hypothalamus]], particularly the ventromedial hypothalamus, leads to obesity caused by the overconsumption of food. This results from the ventromedial hypothalamus failing to respond to physiological signals that suppress appetite. The result is attributed to the feedback control system in the brain. Rats in the study were from the same litter, which had been a closed colony for multiple years. The two rats in each pair had no more than 3% difference in weight. Rats were paired at four weeks old. Unpaired rats were used as controls. The rats were conjoined in three ways. First, the peritoneal cavities were opened and connected between the two rats. Later, to avoid the risk of tangling the two rats’ intestines together, smaller cuts were made. After more refinement of the experimental procedure, the abdominal cavities were not opened and the rats were conjoined at the hip bone with minimal cutting. In order to prove that the two animals were sharing blood, researchers injected dye into the veins of one rat and the pigment would show up in the conjoined rat. It was necessary to verify the exchange of blood and plasma. The scientists refined the lesion placement by practicing the procedure on other rats. The rats were killed with ether and weighed at the conclusion of the experiment and the amount of fat in each animal was quantified.

Many of the parabiotic pairs died throughout the experiment before its conclusion. In each pair, one rat became obese and exhibited hyperphagia. The weight of the rat with the surgical lesion rose rapidly for a few months, then reached a plateau as a direct result of the surgical procedure. After the procedure, the rat with the impaired hypothalamus voraciously ate and the paired rat decreased their appetite. The paired rat became obviously thin throughout the experiment, even rejecting food when it was offered. Some of the paired rats starved to death. Lesions subsequently made in the hypothalamus of two paired rats resulted in hyperphagia and obesity. That result verifies that the paired rat decreased its eating in a direct response to the signals in the blood from the rat with the lesion. If its brain was similarly altered, it also ate voraciously and became obese. The control rats who were given surgical lesions in the hypothalamus became similarly obese to the parabiotic counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hervey | first1 = G. R. | year = 1959 | title = The effects of lesions in the hypothalamus in parabiotic rats | url = | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 145 | issue = 2| pages = 336–352 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1959.sp006145| pmc = 1356830}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later studies linked the effects of the previous parabiotic experiments about metabolism to the discovery of [[leptin]]. Many hormones and metabolites were proven to not be the satiety factor that caused one rat to starve in the experiments. Leptin seemed like a viable candidate. Starting in 1977, Ruth B.S. Harris, a graduate student under Hervey, repeated previous studies about parabiosis in rats and mice. Due to the discovery of leptin, she analyzed leptin concentrations of the mice in the parabiotic experiments. After injecting leptin into the obese mouse of each pair, she found that leptin circulated between the conjoined animals, but the circulation of leptin took some time to reach equilibrium. As a result of the injections, almost immediate weight loss resulted in the parabiotic pairs due to increased inhibition. Approximately 50–70% of fat was lost in the pairs. The obese mouse lost only fat. The lean mouse lost muscle mass and fat. Harris concluded that leptin levels are increased in the obese animal, but other factors could also affect the animals. Also, leptin was determined to decrease fat storage in both the obese and thin animals.&lt;ref name="Harris, R. B. S. 2013"/&gt;

Parabiotic experiments have also been used to study diabetes. Douglas Coleman did further parabiotic experiments to determine diabetic chromosomal relationships. A major gene that causes obesity in mice was identified on chromosome 6. The obese gene (ob/ob) was determined from one mutant mouse, discovered in 1950. Coleman and researchers further identified a gene on chromosome 4 that led to hyperphagia and obesity in mice. The gene also correlated to the severe onset of diabetes (db/db gene). The experimenters used parabiosis to conjoin a db/db mouse to a normal mouse, and the normal mouse would starve to death after one week. The db/db mouse would still have a high blood sugar and food in its system. The db/db mouse was determined to have a satiety factor so potent that the other mouse would starve to death. A db/db mouse was conjoined with an ob/ob mouse and the result was the same as the first experiment. The obese mouse starved in 20–30 days, similar to the thin counterpart in the first experiment. The db/db mutant mouse overproduced a satiety factor but could not respond to it, perhaps due to a defective receptor, whereas the ob/ob mutant recognized and responded to the factor but could not reproduce it. Further studies with db/db mice with lesions in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus suggested that the receptor for the satiety factor was found in these brain receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coleman | first1 = D | year = 2010 | title = A historical perspective on leptin | url = | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 16 | issue = 10| pages = 1097–1099 | doi=10.1038/nm1010-1097}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early parabiotic experiments also included cancer research. One study, published in 1966 by Friedell, studied the effects of radiation with X-rays on ovarian tumors. To study the tumors, two adult female rats were conjoined. The left rat was shielded and the right rat was exposed to high levels of radiation. The rats were given a controlled amount of food and water for the remainder of their natural lives. After death, the rats were autopsied and 149 of 328 pairs showed the presence of possible ovarian tumors in one or both of the two animals. This result matched previous studies of single rats. Since Friedell’s experiment, other parabiotic experiments have been useful in researching many types of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Friedell | first1 = G. H. | last2 = Sommers | first2 = S. C. | last3 = Chute | first3 = R. N. | last4 = Warren | first4 = S. | year = 1966 | title = Ovarian tumorigenesis in irradiated parabiotic rats | url = | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 427–434 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronic diseases of age have been saluted as prime candidates for parabiotic research because of the potential to conjoin an older animal with a younger animal. This process could be used to research cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis, and Alzheimer’s disease. As animals age, their [[oligodendrocyte]]s reduce in efficiency, resulting in decreased myelination, causing negative effects on the [[central nervous system]] (CNS). Julia Ruckh and fellow researchers have used parabiosis to study [[remyelination]] from adult stem cells to see if conjoining young with older mice could reverse or delay this process. In the experiment, the two mice were conjoined and demyelination was induced via injection into the older mice. The experiment determined that factors from the younger mice reversed CNS demyelination in older mice by revitalizing the oligodendrocytes. The [[monocyte]]s from the younger mice also enhanced the ability of the older mice to clear myelin debris because the young monocytes can clear lipids from myelin sheaths more effectively than older monocytes. The conjoining of the two animals reversed the effects of age on the myelination cells. The ability of the young mouse’s cells was unaffected. Enhanced immunity from the younger mouse also promoted the general health of the older mouse in each pair. The results of this experiment could lead to therapy processes for people with demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ruckh | first1 = Julia M. | last2 = Zhao | first2 = Jing-Wei | last3 = Shadrach | first3 = Jennifer L. | last4 = Peter | first4 =  | last5 = Nageswara Rao | first5 = Tata | last6 = Wagers | first6 = Amy J. | last7 = Franklin | first7 = Robin J.M. | year = 2012 | title = Rejuvenation of Regeneration in the Aging Central Nervous System | url = | journal = Cell Stem Cell | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 96–103 | doi=10.1016/j.stem.2011.11.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parabiotic research can be controversial. Due to accusations of animal cruelty, the practice is now shunned in many countries. Compared to other research techniques, there are relatively few parabiotic experiments. Some scientists argue for the benefits of parabiotic research. Eggel and Wyss-Coray argue that conjoining animals mimics naturally occurring parabiosis in nature due to the shared blood supply of conjoined twins. The experiments give insight into the way that bodily systems circulate, which has led to many advances in the study of a variety of diseases. Parabiotic experiments have been used to study obesity, chronic diseases of age, stem cell research, tissue regeneration, diabetes, transplants, tumor biology, and endocrinology.&lt;ref name="Eggel, A. 2014"/&gt; Wyss-Coray has also conducted research into [[young blood transfusion]], the donation of blood from a young donor to an older recipient.

==Parabiosis in physiology==
Other than in experimental physiology, the term also is applicable to spontaneously occurring conditions such as in conjoined twins.&lt;ref name="MW"/&gt;

Logically the word parabiosis would be equally applicable to various forms of parasitism such as the [[obligate]] parasitic reproduction of [[Anglerfish]] of the family [[Ceratiidae]], in which the circulatory systems of the males and females unite completely. Without the attachment of males to a female, the endocrine functions cannot mature, the individuals fail to develop properly and die young and without reproducing.&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, Klaus. Marine Parasitology. CSIRO Publishing 2005. {{ISBN|978-0643090255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in plants growing closely together roots or stems in intimate contact sometimes form natural grafts. More commonly, in parasitic plants such as [[mistletoe]] and [[dodder]] the [[haustorium|haustoria]] unite the circulatory systems of the host and the parasite so intimately that parasitic twiners such as ''[[Cassytha#Reproduction and ecology|Cassytha]]'' may act as vectors carrying disease organisms from one host plant to another.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, Alan R., Coile, Nancy C., Schubert. Timothy S.; "Comparison of Two Parasitic Vines: Dodder (Cuscuta) and Woe Vine (Cassytha)". Botany Circular No. 30. Fla. Dept Agric. &amp; Consumer Services January/February 1996. Division of Plant Industry&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inactive physiological states==
Parabiosis as a term also applies to the states assumed by many organisms in various [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] of life, such as some bacteria, the bear animalcules ([[Tardigrade|Tardigrada]]), and [[Rotifer]]a. At least some members of all these [[Taxon|taxa]] can survive drying out, often for decades or longer. Some bacteria, such as those causing [[anthrax]], produce inactive, resistant spores that survive underground for many years. The eggs of some animals, such as [[Anostraca]], the brine shrimps and their close relatives, have resistant shells and can survive in seasonally dried-out pools. In such a state the organisms show no sign of life until suitable conditions return. In this sense the ''para'' root apparently refers to the state as being "outside" of life.&lt;ref name="MW"/&gt;

==Ecology of social organisms sharing nests==
[[File:Shattuck 53813, Crematogaster modiglianii and Camponotus rufifemur parabiosis, Danum Valley, Sabah-web (5042353719) (2).jpg|thumb|''[[Crematogaster]] modiglianii'' and ''[[Camponotus]] rufifemur'' ants sharing a nest]]
In the late 19th century the first examples were discovered, of colonies of ants that more or less routinely shared their nests with essentially unrelated species of ants. They did not obviously share anything beyond the upkeep of the nests, even segregating their brood, so these were a very surprising observations; most ants are radically intolerant of intruders, usually including even intruders of their own species.

In the early 20th century [[Auguste-Henri Forel]] coined the term "parabiosis" for such associations, and it was adopted by the likes of [[William Morton Wheeler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wheeler | first1 = William Morton | year = 1921 | title = A New Case of Parabiosis and the "Ant Gardens" of British Guiana | journal = Ecology | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 89–103 | jstor=1928921 | doi=10.2307/1928921| url = https://zenodo.org/record/25181/files/3360.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has remained in currency, for example: "Parabiosis is defined as a special symbiosis, so far known only from a few Neotropical ant species, in which two or more species occupy the same nest site and forage together while keeping brood separate".&lt;ref name=Swain&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Swain | first1 = R. B. | year = 1980 | title = Trophic competition among parabiotic ants | url = | journal = Insectes Sociaux | volume = 27 | issue = 4| pages = 377–390 | doi = 10.1007/BF02223730 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As is to be expected in matters concerning [[ethology]] and [[ecology]] however, such a class of behaviour patterns cannot be distinguished puristically from every other; there are exceptions and differences of kind and degree. Parabiosis ranges from the sharing of common trails to sharing common nests, and from effectively tolerating another species in general, to toleration only of the single colony of that species that shares the same nest. Furthermore, there is evidence for the partitioning of functions and unequal sharing of work between the two species in the nest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Menzel | first1 = Florian | last2 = Linsenmair | first2 = Karl Eduard | last3 = Blüthgen | first3 = Nico | year = 2008 | title = Selective interspecific tolerance in tropical Crematogaster–Camponotus associations | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 75 | issue = 3| pages = 837–846 | doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.07.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early reports that parabiotic ant colonies forage and feed together peacefully also have been qualified by observations that revealed ants of one species in such an association aggressively displacing members of the other species from artificially provided food, while also profiting by following their recruitment trails to new food sources.&lt;ref name=Swain/&gt;

In practice parabiosis hardly could be a purely neutral interaction. There can be consequent benefits from shared nest defence and maintenance even when there is neither direct cooperation nor inimical interaction between the two associated populations in a nest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Menzel | first1 = F. | last2 = Blüthgen | first2 = N. | year = 2010 | title = Parabiotic associations between tropical ants: equal partnership or parasitic exploitation? | url = | journal = Journal of Animal Ecology | volume = 79 | issue = 1| pages = 71–81 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01628.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A carbon fiber electrode is used to quickly change the voltage to oxidize dopamine and reduce dopamine-O-quinone.  The resulting alternating current is used to find the instantaneous concentration of dopamine in the extracellular fluid.]]
'''Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry''' ('''FSCV''') is [[cyclic voltammetry]] with a very high scan rate (up to {{val|1|e=6|u=[[volt|V]]·[[second|s]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bard|title=Encyclopedia of Electrochemistry|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-3-527-30250-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Application of high scan rate allows rapid acquisition of a [[voltammogram]] within several milliseconds and ensures high temporal resolution of this [[electroanalytical method|electroanalytical technique]]. An acquisition rate of 10&amp;nbsp;Hz is routinely employed.

FSCV in combination with [[Carbon (fiber)|carbon-fiber]] microelectrodes became a very popular method for detection of [[neurotransmitters]], [[hormones]] and [[metabolites]] in biological systems.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wightman |first=R. M. |year=2006 |title=Probing Cellular Chemistry in Biological Systems with Microelectrodes |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=311 |issue=5767 |pages=1570–1574 |doi=10.1126/science.1120027 |pmid=16543451 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, FSCV was successfully used for detection of electrochemically active [[biogenic amines]] release in [[chromaffin cells]] ([[adrenaline]] and [[noradrenaline]]), [[Slice preparation|brain slices]] ([[Serotonin|5-HT]], [[dopamine]], [[norepinephrine]]) and [[in vivo]] in [[anesthetized]] or awake and behaving animals ([[dopamine]]). Further refinements of the method have enabled detection of [[5-HT]], [[norepinephrine]], [[adenosine]], [[oxygen]], [[pH]] changes [[in vivo]] in [[rat]]s and [[Mouse|mice]] as well as measurement of dopamine and serotonin concentration in [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]].

== Principles of FSCV ==
In fast-scan cyclic [[voltammetry]] (FSCV), a small [[Carbon fibers|carbon fiber]] [[electrode]] (micrometer scale) is inserted into living cells, tissue, or [[Extracellular|extracellular space]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Robinson DL, Venton BJ, Heien ML, Wightman RM. Detecting subsecond dopamine release with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in vivo. Clin Chem. 2003 Oct;49(10):1763-73. Review. {{PMID|14500617}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The electrode is then used to quickly raise and lower the voltage in a triangular wave fashion.  When the voltage is in the correct range (typically ±1 Volt) the compound of interest will be repeatedly oxidized and reduced.  This will result in a movement of electrons in solution that will ultimately create a small alternating current (nano amps scale).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Wassum KM, Phillips PE. Probing the neurochemical correlates of motivation and decision making. ACS Chem Neurosci. 2015 Jan 21;6(1):11-3. {{doi|10.1021/cn500322y}}. Epub 2014 Dec 19. Review. {{PMID|25526380}}; {{PMC|4304500}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  By subtracting the background current created by the probe from the resulting current, it is possible to generate a voltage vs. current plot that is unique to each compound.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=David O. |last1=Wipf |first2=Eric W. |last2=Kristensen |first3=Mark R. |last3=Deakin |first4=R. Mark |last4=Wightman |title=Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry as a method to measure rapid heterogeneous electron-transfer kinetics |journal=Analytical Chemistry |date=1988 |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=306–310 |doi=10.1021/ac00155a006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the time scale of the voltage oscillations is known, this can then be used to calculate a plot of the current in solution as a function of time.  The relative concentrations of the compound may be calculated as long as the number of electrons transferred in each oxidation and reduction reaction is known.

Advantages such as chemical specificity, high resolution, and noninvasive probes make FSCV a powerful technique for detecting changing chemical concentrations in vivo.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The chemical specificity of FSCV is derived from [[reduction potential]]s.  Every compound has a unique reduction potential, and so the alternating voltage can be set to select for a particular compound.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  As a result, FSCV can be used to measure a variety of electrically active biological compounds such as catacholamines, [[indolamines]], and  [[neurotransmitter]]s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Concentration changes regarding [[ascorbic acid]], [[oxygen]], [[nitric oxide]], and hydrogen ions ([[pH]]) can also be detected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  It can even be used to measure multiple compounds at the same time, as long as one has a positive and the other has a negative [[Reduction potential|redox potential]].   High resolution is achieved by changing the voltage at very high speeds, referred to as a fast scan rate.  Scan rates for FSCV are on the sub-second scale, oxidizing and reducing compounds in microseconds.  Another advantage of FSCV is its ability to be used in vivo.  Typical electrodes consist of small carbon fiber needles that are micrometers in diameter and able to be noninvasively inserted into live tissues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The size of the electrode also permits it to probe very specific brain regions.  Thus, FSCV has proved to be effective in measuring chemical fluctuations of living organisms and has been used in conjunction with several behavioral studies.

Acceptable voltage and current ranges are common limitations of FSCV.  To start, the electric potential must stay within the voltage range of the [[electrolysis of water]] (Eo = ± 1.23).  Additionally, the resulting current must remain low in order to avoid [[Lysis|cell lysis]] as well as cell [[depolarization]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Fast scan cyclic voltammetry is also limited in that it only makes differential measurements; the currents it measures are only relative to the background, so they cannot be used to quantify resting concentrations.  This is partially due to the fact that the basal current levels are largely affected by factors such as pH, so over longer periods of time these values tend to drift.  The age of the electrode is also important, and probes tend to be less accurate the longer they are used.

This technique is also limited to quantifying the concentrations of electrically active compounds, and can only be used with select molecules in biological systems.  In spite of this, there have been methods developed to measure levels of non-electric [[enzyme]]s that have an electroactive [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  However, in this scenario, the electrode probes are also a limiting factor in the data resolution.  When measuring an electroactive substrate, the probe is often coated with its corresponding enzyme.  In order to avoid the enzyme interacting with different substrates, the electrode is also coated with a [[polymer]] that acts as a selective filter against particular types of ions.  However, when this polymer is added it lowers the speed at which the voltage scans can be made and effectively lowers the data resolution.

== Applications ==

=== Measurement of dopamine in vivo ===
FSCV is used to monitor changes in concentration of dopamine in mammalian brain in real time with sensitivity down to 1 nM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Robinson |first1=DL |last2=Venton |first2=BJ |last3=Heien |first3=ML |last4=Wightman |first4=RM |title=Detecting subsecond dopamine release with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in vivo. |journal=Clinical chemistry |date=October 2003 |volume=49 |issue=10 |pages=1763-73 |doi=10.1373/49.10.1763 |pmid=14500617}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using an acquisition rate of 10&amp;nbsp;Hz is fast enough to sample dynamics of neurotransmitter release and clearance. Pharmacological action of dopaminergic drugs such as [[Dopamine receptor D1|D1]] and [[Dopamine receptor D2|D2]] receptors [[Dopamine agonist|agonists]] and [[Dopamine receptor antagonist|antagonist]] ([[raclopride]], [[haloperidol]]), [[dopamine transporter]] [[Dopamine reuptake inhibitor|blockers]] ([[cocaine]], [[nomifensine]], [[GBR 12909]]) could be evaluated with FSCV. The fast acquisition rate also allows the study of dopamine dynamics during behavior.

The effects of [[psychostimulants]] (cocaine, [[amphetamine]] and [[methamphetamine]]), [[opioids]] ([[morphine]] and [[heroin]]), [[cannabinoids]], [[alcohol]] and [[nicotine]] on [[dopaminergic]] neurotransmission and development of drug addiction was studied with FSCV.

Dopamine is a primary neurotransmitter mediating learning, goal-directing behavior and decision making. Monitoring of dopamine concentration in vivo in behaving animals with FSCV reveals dopamine coding of the brain's decision making process.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Measurement of other monoamine neurotransmitters ===
FSCV is used to study dynamics of [[exocytosis]] of noradrenaline and adrenaline from chromaffin cells; release of [[serotonin]] from [[mast cells]]; release of 5-HT in brain slices; release of 5-HT in brain of anesthetized rodents and fruit flies; release of norepinephrine in brain of anesthetized and freely moving rodents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2549">The '''universality–diversity paradigm''' is the analysis of biological materials based on the universality and diversity of its fundamental structural elements and functional mechanisms. The analysis of biological systems based on this classification has been a cornerstone of modern [[biology]].

For example, [[protein]]s constitute the elementary building blocks of a vast variety of biological materials such as cells, spider silk or bone, where they create extremely robust, multi-functional materials by self-organization of structures over many length- and time scales, from nano to macro. Some of the structural features are commonly found in many different tissues, that is, they are highly conserved. Examples of such universal building blocks include alpha-helices, beta-sheets or tropocollagen molecules. In contrast, other features are highly specific to tissue types, such as particular
filament assemblies, beta-sheet nanocrystals in spider silk or tendon fascicles. This coexistence of universality and diversity—referred to as the universality–diversity paradigm (UDP)—is an overarching feature in biological materials and a crucial component of [[materiomics]]. It might provide guidelines for bioinspired and biomimetic material development, where this concept is translated into the use of inorganic or hybrid organic-inorganic building blocks.

'''Biology''' is the [[natural science]] that studies [[life]] and living [[organism]]s, including their [[anatomy|physical structure]], [[Biochemistry|chemical processes]], [[Molecular biology|molecular interactions]], [[Physiology|physiological mechanisms]], [[Developmental biology|development]] and [[evolution]].&lt;ref name=aquarenagloss&gt;Based on definition from: {{cite web |url=http://www.bio.txstate.edu/~wetlands/Glossary/glossary.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040608113114/http://www.bio.txstate.edu/~wetlands/Glossary/glossary.html |archivedate=2004-06-08 |title=Aquarena Wetlands Project glossary of terms |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;  |publisher=Texas State University at San Marcos}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the complexity of the science, there are certain unifying concepts that consolidate it into a single, coherent field.

The term ''[[wikt:biology|biology]]'' is derived from the [[Greek Language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|[[wikt:βίος|βίος]]}}, ''bios'', "[[life]]" and the suffix {{lang|grc|[[wikt:-λογία|-λογία]]}}, ''-logia'', "study of."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://topics.info.com/Who-coined-the-term-biology_716 |title=Who coined the term biology? |work=Info.com |accessdate=2012-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509211839/http://topics.info.com/Who-coined-the-term-biology_716 |archivedate=2013-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict&gt;{{cite web | title=biology | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=biology&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 | publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307163258/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=biology&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 | archivedate=2013-03-07 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin-language form of the term first appeared in 1736 when Swedish scientist [[Carl Linnaeus]] (Carl von Linné) used ''biologi'' in his ''Bibliotheca botanica''. It was used again in 1766 in a work entitled ''Philosophiae naturalis sive physicae: tomus III, continens geologian, biologian, phytologian generalis'', by [[Michael Christoph Hanow|Michael Christoph Hanov]], a disciple of [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]. The first German use, ''Biologie'', was in a 1771 translation of Linnaeus' work. In 1797, Theodor Georg August Roose used the term in the preface of a book, ''Grundzüge der Lehre van der Lebenskraft''. [[Karl Friedrich Burdach]] used the term in 1800 in a more restricted sense of the study of human beings from a morphological, physiological and psychological perspective (''Propädeutik zum Studien der gesammten Heilkunst''). The term came into its modern usage with the six-volume treatise ''Biologie, oder Philosophie der lebenden Natur'' (1802–22) by [[Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus]], who announced:&lt;ref name=Richards&gt;{{cite book|last=Richards|first=Robert J. |title=The Romantic Conception of Life: Science and Philosophy in the Age of Goethe|year=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press | isbn= 978-0-226-71210-9 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=X7N4_i7vrTUC&amp;printsec=frontcover }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The objects of our research will be the different forms and manifestations of life, the conditions and laws under which these phenomena occur, and the causes through which they have been effected. The science that concerns itself with these objects we will indicate by the name biology [Biologie] or the doctrine of life [Lebenslehre].

Although modern biology is a relatively recent development, sciences related to and included within it have been studied since ancient times. [[Natural philosophy]] was studied as early as the ancient civilizations of [[Mesopotamia]], [[Egypt]], the [[Indian subcontinent]], and [[China]]. However, the origins of modern biology and its approach to the study of nature are most often traced back to [[ancient Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Magner|first=Lois N.|title=A History of the Life Sciences, Revised and Expanded|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC|year=2002|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-203-91100-6|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324125937/http://books.google.com/books?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC|archivedate=2015-03-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Anthony | last=Serafini |title=The Epic History of Biology |date=2013 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z3oECAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;q=biology%20egypt|accessdate=14 July 2015| isbn=978-1-4899-6327-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the formal study of [[medicine]] dates back to [[Hippocrates]] (ca. 460–370 BC), it was [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) who contributed most extensively to the development of biology. Especially important are his ''[[History of Animals]]'' and other works where he showed naturalist leanings, and later more empirical works that focused on biological causation and the diversity of life. Aristotle's successor at the [[Lyceum]], [[Theophrastus]], wrote a series of books on [[botany]] that survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to the plant sciences, even into the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="eb1911"&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Theophrastus|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars of the [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|medieval Islamic world]] who wrote on biology included [[al-Jahiz]] (781–869), [[Al-Dīnawarī]] (828–896), who wrote on botany,&lt;ref name="Fahd-815"&gt;{{cite book | last=Fahd | first=Toufic |contribution=Botany and agriculture|page=815|ref=harv|editor-last1=Morelon |editor-first1=Régis |editor-last2=Rashed |editor-first2=Roshdi |year=1996 |title=Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science |volume=3 |publisher=[[Routledge]] | isbn=978-0-415-12410-2| title-link=Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi|Rhazes]] (865–925) who wrote on [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]]. [[Medicine]] was especially well studied by Islamic scholars working in Greek philosopher traditions, while natural history drew heavily on Aristotelian thought, especially in upholding a fixed hierarchy of life.

Biology began to quickly develop and grow with [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]]'s dramatic improvement of the [[microscope]]. It was then that scholars discovered [[spermatozoa]], [[bacteria]], [[infusoria]] and the diversity of microscopic life. Investigations by [[Jan Swammerdam]] led to new interest in [[entomology]] and helped to develop the basic techniques of microscopic [[dissection]] and [[staining]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Magner |first=Lois N. |title=A History of the Life Sciences, Revised and Expanded |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC |year=2002 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-203-91100-6 |pages=133–44 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324125937/http://books.google.com/books?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC |archivedate=2015-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in [[microscopy]] also had a profound impact on biological thinking. In the early 19th century, a number of biologists pointed to the central importance of the [[cell (biology)|cell]]. Then, in 1838, [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann|Schwann]] began promoting the now universal ideas that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the cell and (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of [[life]], although they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells. Thanks to the work of [[Robert Remak]] and [[Rudolf Virchow]], however, by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets of what came to be known as [[cell theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jan | last=Sapp | authorlink=Jan Sapp | year=2003 | title=Genesis: The Evolution of Biology | chapter=7 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=New York. | isbn=978-0-19-515618-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Coleman | first=William  | year=1977 | title=Biology in the Nineteenth Century: Problems of Form, Function, and Transformation | chapter=| publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=New York | isbn=978-0-521-29293-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, taxonomy and classification became the focus of natural historians. [[Carl Linnaeus]] published a basic [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] for the natural world in 1735 (variations of which have been in use ever since), and in the 1750s introduced [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific names]] for all his species.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst. ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]], treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleable—even suggesting the possibility of [[common descent]]. Although he was opposed to evolution, Buffon is a key figure in the [[history of evolutionary thought]]; his work influenced the evolutionary theories of both [[Lamarck]] and [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst. ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Serious evolutionary thinking originated with the works of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], who was the first to present a coherent theory of evolution.&lt;ref name="Gould 2002 187"&gt;[[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould, Stephen Jay]]. ''The Structure of Evolutionary Theory''. The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press: Cambridge, 2002. {{ISBN|0-674-00613-5}}. p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; He posited that evolution was the result of environmental stress on properties of animals, meaning that the more frequently and rigorously an organ was used, the more complex and efficient it would become, thus adapting the animal to its environment. Lamarck believed that these acquired traits could then be passed on to the animal's offspring, who would further develop and perfect them.&lt;ref name=Lam1914&gt;[[#Lamarck1914|Lamarck (1914)]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was the British naturalist [[Charles Darwin]], combining the biogeographical approach of [[Alexander von Humboldt|Humboldt]], the uniformitarian geology of [[Charles Lyell|Lyell]], [[Thomas Malthus|Malthus's]] writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise and extensive natural observations, who forged a more successful evolutionary theory based on [[natural selection]]; similar reasoning and evidence led [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] to independently reach the same conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst. ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', chapter 10: "Darwin's evidence for evolution and common descent"; and chapter 11: "The causation of evolution: natural selection"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Edward J. |title=Evolution: The Remarkable History of a Scientific Theory |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xzLRvxlJhzkC |year=2006 |publisher=Random House Publishing Group |isbn=978-1-58836-538-5 |chapter=Ch. 3 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324124009/http://books.google.com/books?id=xzLRvxlJhzkC |archivedate=2015-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was the subject of [[Creation–evolution controversy|controversy]] (which continues to this day), Darwin's theory quickly spread through the scientific community and soon became a central axiom of the rapidly developing science of biology.

The discovery of the physical representation of heredity came along with evolutionary principles and [[population genetics]]. In the 1940s and early 1950s, experiments pointed to [[DNA]] as the component of [[chromosomes]] that held the trait-carrying units that had become known as [[genes]]. A focus on new kinds of model organisms such as [[viruses]] and [[bacteria]], along with the discovery of the double helical structure of DNA in 1953, marked the transition to the era of [[molecular genetics]]. From the 1950s to present times, biology has been vastly extended in the [[Molecular Biology|molecular]] domain. The [[genetic code]] was cracked by [[Har Gobind Khorana]], [[Robert W. Holley]] and [[Marshall Warren Nirenberg]] after DNA was understood to contain [[codons]]. Finally, the [[Human Genome Project]] was launched in 1990 with the goal of mapping the general human [[genome]]. This project was essentially completed in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2940601.stm | title=Human genome finally complete | accessdate=2006-07-22 | date=2003-04-14 | work=BBC News | first=Ivan | last=Noble | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614141605/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2940601.stm | archivedate=2006-06-14 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with further analysis still being published. The Human Genome Project was the first step in a globalized effort to incorporate accumulated knowledge of biology into a functional, molecular definition of the human body and the bodies of other organisms.

==Foundations of modern biology==

===Cell theory===
[[File:HeLa Hoechst 33258.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|alt=HeLa cells stained with Hoechst blue stain.|Human [[cancer cell]]s with nuclei (specifically the DNA) stained blue. The central and rightmost cell are in [[interphase]], so the entire nuclei are labeled. The cell on the left is going through [[mitosis]] and its DNA has condensed.]]
{{Main|Cell theory}}

Cell theory states that the [[cell (biology)|cell]] is the fundamental unit of [[life]], that all living things are composed of one or more cells, and that all cells arise from pre-existing cells through [[cell division]]. In [[multicellular organisms]], every cell in the organism's body derives ultimately from a [[zygote|single cell]] in a fertilized [[egg (biology)|egg]]. The cell is also considered to be the basic unit in many pathological processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Mazzarello, P | title=A unifying concept: the history of cell theory | journal=Nature Cell Biology | volume=1 | issue=1 | pages=E13–15 | date=May 1999 | pmid=10559875 | doi=10.1038/8964}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the phenomenon of [[energy transfer|energy flow]] occurs in cells in processes that are part of the function known as [[metabolism]]. Finally, cells contain hereditary information ([[DNA]]), which is passed from cell to cell during cell division. Research into the origin of life, [[abiogenesis]], amounts to an attempt to discover the origin of the first cells.

===Evolution===
[[File:Mutation and selection diagram.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|alt=diagram showing Natural selection favoring predominance of surviving mutation|[[Natural selection]] of a population for dark coloration.]]
{{Main|Evolution}}
A central organizing concept in biology is that life changes and develops through evolution, and that all life-forms known have a [[Common descent|common origin]]. The theory of evolution postulates that all [[organism]]s on the [[Earth]], both living and extinct, have descended from a common ancestor or an ancestral [[gene pool]]. This [[last universal common ancestor of all organisms|universal common ancestor of all organisms]] is believed to have appeared about [[Timeline of evolution|3.5 billion years ago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Life Evolving: Molecules, Mind, and Meaning | last=De Duve | first=Christian | location=New York | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2002| page=44 | isbn=978-0-19-515605-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologists regard the ubiquity of the [[genetic code]] as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent for all [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[archaea]], and [[eukaryote]]s (see: [[origin of life]]).&lt;ref name="Futuyma"&gt;{{cite book| author=Futuyma, DJ |title=Evolution |year=2005 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |isbn=978-0-87893-187-3 |oclc=57311264 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "evolution" was introduced into the scientific lexicon by [[Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck]] in 1809,&lt;ref name="p15"&gt;{{cite book |last=Packard |first=Alpheus Spring |title= Lamarck, the founder of Evolution: his life and work with translations of his writings on organic evolution|year= 1901 |publisher= Longmans, Green. |location=New York | isbn=978-0-405-12562-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and fifty years later [[Charles Darwin]] posited a scientific model of natural selection as evolution's driving force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/biography.html | title=The Complete Works of Darwin Online – Biography | publisher=darwin-online.org.uk | access-date=2006-12-15 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107165048/http://darwin-online.org.uk/biography.html | archivedate=2007-01-07 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dobzhansky |first1=T. |year=1973 |title=Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution |journal=The American Biology Teacher |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=125–29 |doi= 10.2307/4444260|jstor=4444260 |url=|citeseerx=10.1.1.525.3586}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=On the origin of species by means of natural selection | editor-last=Carroll | editor-first=Joseph |year=2003 |publisher=Broadview |location= Peterborough, Ontario | isbn=978-1-55111-337-1 | page=15 | quote=As Darwinian scholar Joseph Carroll of the University of Missouri–St. Louis puts it in his introduction to a modern reprint of Darwin's work: "''The Origin of Species'' has special claims on our attention. It is one of the two or three most significant works of all time—one of those works that fundamentally and permanently alter our vision of the world ... It is argued with a singularly rigorous consistency but it is also eloquent, imaginatively evocative, and rhetorically compelling."  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Alfred Russel Wallace]] is recognized as the co-discoverer of this concept as he helped research and experiment with the concept of evolution.)&lt;ref&gt;Shermer p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution is now used to explain the great variations of life found on Earth.

Darwin theorized that species flourish or die when subjected to the processes of [[natural selection]] or [[selective breeding]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]] (1859). ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genetic drift]] was embraced as an additional mechanism of evolutionary development in the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of the theory.&lt;ref name=GGS&gt;{{Cite book | last=Simpson | first=George Gaylord | author-link=George Gaylord Simpson | year=1967 | title=The Meaning of Evolution | publisher=Yale University Press | edition=Second | isbn=978-0-300-00952-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolutionary history of the [[species]]—which describes the characteristics of the various species from which it descended—together with its genealogical relationship to every other species is known as its [[phylogeny]]. Widely varied approaches to biology generate information about phylogeny. These include the comparisons of [[DNA sequence]]s, a product of [[molecular biology]] (more particularly [[genomics]]), and comparisons of [[fossil]]s or other records of ancient organisms, a product of [[paleontology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bio-medicine.org/q-more/biology-definition/phylogeny/ |title=Phylogeny |publisher=Bio-medicine.org |date=2007-11-11 |accessdate=2013-10-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004224700/http://www.bio-medicine.org/q-more/biology-definition/phylogeny/ |archivedate=2013-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologists organize and analyze evolutionary relationships through various methods, including [[phylogenetics]], [[phenetics]], and [[cladistics]]. (For a summary of major events in the evolution of life as currently understood by biologists, see [[evolutionary timeline]].)

Evolution is relevant to the understanding of the natural history of life forms and to the understanding of the organization of current life forms. But, those organizations can only be understood in the light of how they came to be by way of the process of evolution. Consequently, evolution is central to all fields of biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Montévil, M; Mossio, M; Pocheville, A; Longo, G | title=Theoretical principles for biology: Variation | journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology | volume=122 | issue=1 | pages=36–50 | date=October 2016 | pmid=27530930 | doi=10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2016.08.005 | url=https://www.academia.edu/27942089 | series=From the Century of the Genome to the Century of the Organism: New Theoretical Approaches | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320150224/http://www.academia.edu/27942089/Theoretical_principles_for_biology_Variation | archivedate=2018-03-20 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Genetics}}
[[Gene]]s are the primary units of inheritance in all organisms. A gene is a unit of [[heredity]] and corresponds to a region of [[DNA]] that influences the form or function of an organism in specific ways. All organisms, from bacteria to animals, share the same basic machinery that copies and translates DNA into [[protein]]s. Cells [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribe]] a DNA gene into an [[RNA]] version of the gene, and a [[ribosome]] then [[Translation (biology)|translates]] the RNA into a sequence of [[amino acid]]s known as a protein. The [[genetic code|translation code]] from RNA codon to amino acid is the same for most organisms. For example, a sequence of DNA that codes for [[insulin]] in humans also codes for insulin when inserted into other organisms, such as plants.&lt;ref&gt;Marcial, Gene G.

DNA is found as linear [[chromosome]]s in [[eukaryote]]s, and circular chromosomes in [[prokaryote]]s. A chromosome is an organized structure consisting of [[DNA]] and [[histone]]s. The set of chromosomes in a cell and any other hereditary information found in the [[mitochondria]], [[chloroplasts]], or other locations is collectively known as a cell's [[genome]]. In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is localized in the [[cell nucleus]], or with small amounts in [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the [[nucleoid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Thanbichler, M; Wang, SC; Shapiro, L | title=The bacterial nucleoid: a highly organized and dynamic structure | journal=Journal of Cellular Biochemistry | volume=96 | issue=3 | pages=506–21 | date=October 2005 | pmid=15988757 | doi=10.1002/jcb.20519 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete assemblage of this information in an organism is called its [[genotype]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8472 |title=Genotype definition – Medical Dictionary definitions |publisher=Medterms.com |date=2012-03-19 |accessdate=2013-10-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054803/http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8472 |archivedate=2013-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homeostasis===
{{Main|Homeostasis}}
[[File:ACTH Negative Feedback.svg|right|thumb|alt=diagram showing feedback loop of hormones|The [[hypothalamus]] secretes [[Corticotropin-releasing hormone|CRH]], which directs the [[pituitary gland]] to secrete [[ACTH]]. In turn, ACTH directs the adrenal cortex to secrete [[glucocorticoid]]s, such as [[cortisol]].

Homeostasis is the ability of an [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]] to regulate its internal environment to maintain stable conditions by means of multiple [[dynamic equilibrium]] adjustments that are controlled by interrelated regulation mechanisms. All living [[organism]]s, whether [[Single celled|unicellular]] or [[multicellular]], exhibit homeostasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rodolfo | first=Kelvin | date=January 2000 | url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-homeostasis/ | title=What is homeostasis? | journal=Scientific American | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203020456/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=what-is-homeostasis | archivedate=2013-12-03 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To maintain dynamic equilibrium and effectively carry out certain functions, a system must detect and respond to perturbations. After the detection of a perturbation, a biological system normally responds through [[negative feedback]] that stabilize conditions by reducing or increasing the activity of an organ or system. One example is the release of [[glucagon]] when sugar levels are too low.

[[File:Energy and life.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|alt=diagram showing human energy process from food input to heat and waste output|Basic overview of [[Bioenergetics|energy and human life]].]]

===Energy===
The survival of a living organism depends on the continuous input of [[energy]]. Chemical reactions that are responsible for its structure and function are tuned to extract [[Chemistry#Energy|energy]] from substances that act as its food and transform them to help form new cells and sustain them. In this process, [[molecule]]s of [[chemical substance]]s that constitute [[food]] play two roles; first, they contain energy that can be transformed and reused in that organism's biological, [[chemical reaction]]s; second, food can be transformed into new molecular structures (biomolecules) that are of use to that organism.

The organisms responsible for the introduction of energy into an ecosystem are known as producers or [[autotroph]]s. Nearly all such organisms originally draw their energy from the sun.&lt;ref name=bryantfrigaard&gt;{{cite journal | author=Bryant, DA; Frigaard, NU | title=Prokaryotic photosynthesis and phototrophy illuminated | journal=Trends in Microbiology | volume=14 | issue=11 | pages=488–96 | date=November 2006 | pmid=16997562 | doi=10.1016/j.tim.2006.09.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants and other [[phototroph]]s use solar energy via a process known as [[photosynthesis]] to convert raw materials into organic molecules, such as [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], whose bonds can be broken to release energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Smith, AL |title=Oxford dictionary of biochemistry and molecular biology |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1997 |page=508 | isbn=978-0-19-854768-6 | quote=Photosynthesis – the synthesis by organisms of organic chemical compounds, esp. carbohydrates, from carbon dioxide using energy obtained from light rather than the oxidation of chemical compounds.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few [[ecosystems]], however, depend entirely on energy extracted by [[chemotroph]]s from [[methane]], [[sulfides]], or other non-[[Solar energy|luminal]] energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Edwards | first=Katrina | title=Microbiology of a Sediment Pond and the Underlying Young, Cold, Hydrologically Active Ridge Flank | journal=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the energy thus captured produces [[biomass]] and energy that is available for growth and development of other [[life]] forms. The majority of the rest of this biomass and energy are lost as waste molecules and heat. The most important processes for converting the energy trapped in chemical substances into energy useful to sustain life are [[metabolism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Campbell | first1=Neil A. | last2=Reece | first2=Jane B.  |title=Biology |publisher=Benjamin Cummings |year=2001 |chapter=6|isbn=978-0-8053-6624-2 |oclc=47521441}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cellular respiration]].&lt;ref name="Colvard, 2009"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Bartsch | first1=John | last2=Colvard | first2=Mary P. | year=2009 | title=The Living Environment | location=New York State | publisher=Prentice Hall | isbn=978-0-13-361202-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Molecular biology]] is the study of biology at the molecular level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/molecular-biology |title=Molecular Biology |publisher=britannica.com |accessdate=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This field overlaps with other areas of biology, particularly those of [[genetics]] and [[biochemistry]]. Molecular biology is a study of the interactions of the various systems within a cell, including the interrelationships of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and how those interactions are regulated.

The next larger scale, [[cell biology]], studies the structural and [[physiology|physiological]] properties of [[cell (biology)|cells]], including their internal [[behavior]], interactions with other cells, and with their [[natural environment|environment]]. This is done on both the [[microscope|microscopic]] and [[molecule|molecular]] levels, for unicellular organisms such as [[bacterium|bacteria]], as well as the specialized cells of multicellular organisms such as [[human]]s. Understanding the structure and function of cells is fundamental to all of the biological sciences.

===Physiological===
{{Main|Physiology}}

Physiology is the study of the mechanical, physical, and biochemical processes of living organisms function as a whole. The theme of "structure to function" is central to biology. Physiological studies have traditionally been divided into [[plant physiology]] and [[animal physiology]], but some principles of physiology are universal, no matter what particular [[organism]] is being studied. For example, what is learned about the physiology of [[yeast]] cells can also apply to human cells. The field of animal physiology extends the tools and methods of [[human physiology]] to non-human species. Plant physiology borrows techniques from both research fields.

Physiology is the study the interaction of how, for example, the [[nervous system|nervous]], [[immune system|immune]], [[endocrine system|endocrine]], [[respiratory system|respiratory]], and [[circulatory system|circulatory]] systems, function and interact. The study of these systems is shared with such [[medicine|medically]] oriented disciplines as [[neurology]] and [[immunology]].

===Evolutionary===
[[Current research in evolutionary biology|Evolutionary research]] is concerned with the origin and descent of [[species]], and their change over time. It employs scientists from many taxonomically oriented disciplines, for example, those with special training in particular [[organism]]s such as [[mammalogy]], [[ornithology]], [[botany]], or [[herpetology]], but are of use in answering more general questions about evolution.

Evolutionary biology is partly based on [[paleontology]], which uses the [[fossil]] record to answer questions about the mode and tempo of evolution,&lt;ref name=Jablonski&gt;{{cite journal | author=Jablonski D | title=The future of the fossil record | journal=Science | volume=284 | issue=5423 | pages=2114–16 | date=June 1999 | pmid=10381868 | doi=10.1126/science.284.5423.2114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and partly on the developments in areas such as [[population genetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gillespie | first=John H. | authorlink=John H. Gillespie | year=1998 | title=Population Genetics: A Concise Guide | publisher=Johns Hopkins Press | isbn=978-0-8018-5755-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, [[developmental biology]] re-entered evolutionary biology after its initial exclusion from the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] through the study of [[evolutionary developmental biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Vassiliki Betta | last=Smocovitis | year=1996 | title=Unifying Biology: the evolutionary synthesis and evolutionary biology | publisher=Princeton University Press | isbn=978-0-691-03343-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phylogenetics]], [[systematics]], and [[alpha taxonomy|taxonomy]] are related fields often considered part of evolutionary biology.

===Systematic===

Trees constructed with other genes are generally similar, although they may place some early-branching groups very differently, presumably owing to rapid rRNA evolution. The exact relationships of the three domains are still being debated.}}

{{Main|Systematics}}

Multiple [[speciation]] events create a tree structured system of relationships between species. The role of [[systematics]] is to study these relationships and thus the differences and similarities between species and groups of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Neill | first=Campbell | title=Biology; Fourth edition | publisher=The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company | year=1996 | isbn=978-0-8053-1940-8 | page=G-21 (Glossary) }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, systematics was an active field of research long before evolutionary thinking was common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Douglas | first=Futuyma |authorlink=Douglas Futuyma | title=Evolutionary Biology; Third edition | publisher=[[Sinauer Associates]] | year=1998 | isbn=978-0-87893-189-7 | page=88 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, living things have been divided into five kingdoms: [[Monera]]; [[Protist]]a; [[Fungus|Fungi]]; [[Plant]]ae; [[Animal]]ia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Margulis, Lynn; Schwartz, KV |author-link1= Lynn Margulis |title=Five Kingdoms: An Illustrated Guide to the Phyla of Life on Earth |edition=3rd |publisher= WH Freeman &amp; Co|year=1997 |isbn=978-0-7167-3183-2 |oclc=223623098}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many scientists now consider this five-kingdom system outdated. Modern alternative classification systems generally begin with the [[three-domain system]]: [[Archaea]] (originally Archaebacteria); [[Bacteria]] (originally Eubacteria) and [[Eukaryote|Eukaryota]] (including [[protist]]s, [[fungi]], [[plants]], and [[animal]]s).&lt;ref name="domain"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Woese, CR; Kandler, O; Wheelis, ML | title=Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume=87 | issue=12 | pages=4576–79 | date=June 1990 | pmid=2112744 | pmc=54159 | doi=10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576 | bibcode=1990PNAS...87.4576W }}&lt;/ref&gt; These domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not, as well as differences in the chemical composition of key biomolecules such as [[ribosome]]s.&lt;ref name="domain"/&gt;

Further, each kingdom is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified. The order is:
[[Domain (biology)|Domain]]; [[Kingdom (biology)|Kingdom]]; [[Phylum]]; [[Class (biology)|Class]]; [[Order (biology)|Order]]; [[Family (biology)|Family]]; [[Genus]]; [[Species]].

Outside of these categories, there are obligate intracellular [[parasite]]s that are "on the edge of life"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Rybicki, EP | year=1990 | title=The classification of organisms at the edge of life, or problems with virus systematics | journal=S Afr J Sci | volume=86 | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230603479 | pages=182–86 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170718162450/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230603479_The_classification_of_organisms_at_the_edge_of_life_or_problems_with_virus_systematics | archivedate=2017-07-18 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of [[metabolism|metabolic]] activity, meaning that many scientists do not actually classify such structures as alive, due to their lack of at least one or more of the fundamental functions or characteristics that define life. They are classified as [[virus (biology)|viruses]], [[viroid]]s, [[prion]]s, or [[Satellite (biology)|satellites]].

The scientific name of an organism is generated from its genus and species. For example, humans are listed as ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. ''Homo'' is the genus, and ''sapiens'' the species. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the species in lowercase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=McNeill, J|author2=Barrie, FR|author3=Buck, WR|author4=Demoulin, V|author5=Greuter, W|author6=Hawksworth, DL|author7=Herendeen, PS|author8=Knapp, S|author9=Marhold, K|author10=Prado, J|author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, WF|author12=Smith, GF|author13=Wiersema, JH|author14=Turland, NJ |display-authors=6 |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G.

The dominant classification system is called the [[Linnaean taxonomy]]. It includes ranks and [[binomial nomenclature]]. How organisms are named is governed by international agreements such as the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICN), the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN), and the [[International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria]] (ICNB). The classification of [[viruses]], [[viroids]], [[prions]], and all other sub-viral agents that demonstrate biological characteristics is conducted by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] (ICTV) and is known as the International Code of Viral Classification and Nomenclature (ICVCN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ictvonline.org/virusTaxonomy.asp |title=ICTV Virus Taxonomy 2009 |publisher=Ictvonline.org |accessdate=2013-10-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004225742/http://www.ictvonline.org/virusTaxonomy.asp |archivedate=2013-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ictvdbpopsi&gt;&lt;!--citation specified in source--&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20090813214826/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/Ictv/fs_pospi.htm Index of Viruses – Pospiviroidae]'' (2006).

A merging draft, BioCode, was published in 1997 in an attempt to standardize nomenclature in these three areas, but has yet to be formally adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title=The BioCode: Integrated biological nomenclature for the 21st century? | booktitle=Proceedings of a Mini-Symposium on Biological Nomenclature in the 21st Century | last=McNeill | first=John | date=November 1996 | url=http://www.plantsystematics.org/reveal/pbio/nomcl/mcne.html | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140104161223/http://www.plantsystematics.org/reveal/pbio/nomcl/mcne.html | archivedate=2014-01-04 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The BioCode draft has received little attention since 1997; its originally planned implementation date of January 1, 2000, has passed unnoticed.

{{Main|Ecology|Ethology|Behavior|Biogeography}}

[[Ecology]] is the study of the distribution and abundance of [[life|living organisms]], the interaction between them and their [[natural environment|environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Begon, M; Townsend, CR; Harper, JL | title=Ecology: From individuals to ecosystems. (4th ed.) |year=2006 |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=978-1-4051-1117-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An organism shares an environment that includes other organisms and [[biotic factors]] as well as local [[abiotic factors]] (non-living) such as [[climate]] and [[ecology]].&lt;ref name="habitats_of_the_world"&gt;{{cite book | title=Habitats of the world | year=2004 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=U-_mlcy8rGgC&amp;pg=PA238 | publisher=Marshall Cavendish | location=New York | isbn=978-0-7614-7523-1 | page=238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason that biological systems can be difficult to study is that so many different interactions with other organisms and the environment are possible, even on small scales. A microscopic [[bacterium]] responding to a local sugar gradient is responding to its environment as much as a lion searching for food in the African [[savanna]]. For any species, [[behavior]]s can be [[co-operation|co-operative]], [[Competition (biology)|competitive]], [[parasite|parasitic]], or [[symbiosis|symbiotic]]. Matters become more complex when two or more species interact in an [[ecosystem]].

Ecological systems are studied at several different levels, from the scale of the ecology of individual organisms, to those of [[population]]s, to the [[ecosystem]]s and finally the [[biosphere]]. The term [[population biology]] is often used interchangeably with [[population ecology]], although ''population biology'' is more frequently used in the case of [[diseases]], [[viruses]], and [[microbes]], while the term population ecology is more commonly applied to the study of plants and animals. Ecology draws on many subdisciplines.

[[Ethology]] is the study of animal [[behavior]] (particularly that of social animals such as [[primate]]s and [[canidae|canids]]), and is sometimes considered a branch of zoology. Ethologists have been particularly concerned with the [[evolution]] of behavior and the understanding of behavior in terms of the theory of [[natural selection]]. In one sense, the first modern ethologist was [[Charles Darwin]], whose book, ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]],'' influenced many ethologists to come.&lt;ref name="black"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Black, J | title=Darwin in the world of emotions | journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume=95 | issue=6 | pages=311–13 | date=June 2002 | pmid=12042386 | pmc=1279921 | doi=10.1258/jrsm.95.6.311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biogeography]] studies the spatial distribution of organisms on the [[Earth]], focusing on such topics as [[plate tectonics]], [[climate change]], [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] and [[Animal migration|migration]], and [[cladistics]].

==Basic unresolved problems in biology==
{{Main|List of unsolved problems in biology}}
Despite the profound advances made over recent decades in our understanding of life's fundamental processes, some basic problems have remained unresolved. One of the major unresolved problems in biology is the primary adaptive function of sex, and particularly its key processes in eukaryotes of meiosis and homologous recombination.

Another basic unresolved problem in biology is the biologic basis of aging. At present, there is no consensus view on the underlying cause of aging. Various competing theories are outlined in [[Ageing#Theories|Ageing Theories]].

'''Tokogeny''' or '''tocogeny''' is the biological relationship between parent and offspring, or more generally between ancestors and descendants.  In contradistinction to [[phylogeny]] it applies to individual [[organism]]s as opposed to [[species]].

In the tokogentic system shared characteristics are called ''traits''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Species Concepts and Phylogenetic Theory: A Debate|others=Editors: Quentin Wheeler, Rudolf Meier|publisher=Columbia University Press, 2000|chapter=5: The Phylogenetic Concept (''[[sensu]]'' Wheeler and Platnick)|author=Quentin R.

'''Pinch-induced behavioral inhibition''' ('''PIBI'''), also called '''dorsal immobility''', '''transport immobility''' or '''clipnosis''', is a partially inert state which results from a gentle squeeze of the skin behind the [[neck]].  It is mostly observed among [[Felidae|cats]] and allows a female cat to easily carry her kitten with her jaws. It can be used to effectively restrain most cats in a domestic or veterinary context.

In [[biology]], a '''biological life cycle''' (or just '''life cycle''' when the biological context is clear) is a series of changes in form that an organism undergoes, returning to the starting state. "The concept is closely related to those of the life history, [[Developmental biology|development]] and [[ontogeny]], but differs from them in stressing renewal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/55494?uid=3739448&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3737720&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103764585297 |author1=Graham Bell  |author2=Vassiliki Koufopanou  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The architecture of the life cycle in small organisms |journal=Philosophical Transactions: Biological Sciences |year=1991 |volume=332 |issue=1262 |pages=81–89 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1991.0035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transitions of form may involve growth, [[asexual reproduction]], or [[sexual reproduction]].

In some organisms, different "generations" of the species succeed each other during the life cycle. For [[Embryophyte|plants]] and many [[algae]], there are two multicellular stages, and the life cycle is referred to as [[alternation of generations]]. The term '''life history''' is often used, particularly for organisms such as the [[red algae]] which have three multicellular stages (or more), rather than two.&lt;ref name="Dixon73"&gt;Dixon, P.S. 1973. ''Biology of the Rhodophyta.'' Oliver &amp; Boyd. {{ISBN|0 05 002485 X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life cycles that include sexual reproduction involve alternating [[haploid]] (''n'') and [[diploid]] (2''n'') stages, i.e., a change of [[ploidy]] is involved. To return from a diploid stage to a haploid stage, [[meiosis]] must occur. In regard to changes of [[ploidy]], there are 3 types of cycles:
*'''''haplontic''''' life cycle — the haploid stage is multicellular and the diploid stage is a single cell, meiosis is "zygotic".
*'''''diplontic''''' life cycle — the diploid stage is multicellular and haploid [[gamete]]s are formed, meiosis is "gametic".
*'''''haplodiplontic''''' life cycle (also referred to as ''diplohaplontic'', ''diplobiontic'', or ''dibiontic'' life cycle) — multicellular diploid and haploid stages occur, meiosis is "sporic".

The cycles differ in when [[mitosis]] (growth) occurs. '''Zygotic meiosis''' and '''gametic meiosis''' have one mitotic stage: mitosis occurs during the ''n'' phase in zygotic meiosis and during the 2''n'' phase in gametic meiosis. Therefore, zygotic and gametic meiosis are collectively termed '''haplobiontic''' (single mitotic phase, not to be confused with haplontic). '''Sporic meiosis''', on the other hand, has mitosis in two stages, both the diploid and haploid stages, termed '''diplobiontic''' (not to be confused with diplontic).

==Discovery==
The study of [[reproduction]] and [[Embryogenesis|development]] in organisms was carried out by many botanists and zoologists.

[[Wilhelm Hofmeister]] demonstrated that [[alternation of generations]] is a feature that unites plants, and published this result in 1851 (see [[History of botany#Plant sexuality|plant sexuality]]).

Some terms (haplobiont and diplobiont) used for the description of life cycles were proposed initially for algae by Nils Svedelius, and then became used for other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Nils Eberhard Svedelius. 1873-1960 | author=C.

==Haplontic life cycle==
[[File:Haploid English.svg|thumb|250px|Zygotic meiosis]]
A '''zygotic meiosis''' is a [[meiosis]] of a [[zygote]] immediately after [[karyogamy]], which is the fusion of two [[cell nucleus|cell nuclei]]. This way, the organism ends its diploid phase and produces several haploid cells. These cells divide [[mitotic]]ally to form either larger, multicellular individuals, or more haploid cells. Two opposite types of gametes (e.g., male and female) from these individuals or cells fuse to become a zygote.

In the whole cycle, zygotes are the only diploid cell; mitosis occurs only in the haploid phase.

The individuals or cells as a result of mitosis are '''haplonts''', hence this life cycle is also called '''haplontic life cycle'''. Haplonts are:

Cambridge University Press (623 pp).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplontic life cycle==
[[File:Diploid English.svg|thumb|250px|Gametic meiosis]]

In '''gametic meiosis''', instead of immediately dividing ''meiotically'' to produce haploid cells, the zygote divides ''mitotically'' to produce a multicellular diploid individual or a group of more unicellular diploid cells. Cells from the diploid individuals then undergo meiosis to produce haploid cells or [[gamete]]s. Haploid cells may divide again (by mitosis) to form more haploid cells, as in many yeasts, but the haploid phase is not the predominant life cycle phase. In most diplonts, mitosis occurs only in the diploid phase, i.e. gametes usually form quickly and fuse to produce diploid zygotes.

In the whole cycle, gametes are usually the only haploid cells, and mitosis usually occurs only in the diploid phase.

The diploid multicellular individual is a '''diplont''', hence a gametic meiosis is also called a '''diplontic life cycle'''. Diplonts are:

* In [[archaeplastida]]ns: some [[green algae]] (e.g., ''[[Cladophora|Cladophora glomerata]]'',&lt;ref&gt;O. P. Sharma. Textbook of Algae, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Acetabularia]]''&lt;ref name="Díaz" /&gt;)
* In [[stramenopiles]]: some [[brown algae]] (the [[Fucales]], however, their life cycle can also be interpreted as strongly heteromorphic-diplohaplontic, with a highly reduced gametophyte phase, as in the [[flowering plants]]),&lt;ref&gt;van den Hoek, C. et al.

==Haplodiplontic life cycle==
[[File:Diplohaplontic English.svg|thumb|250px|Sporic meiosis]]
{{Main|Alternation of generations}}
In '''sporic meiosis''' (also commonly known as '''intermediary meiosis'''), the zygote divides mitotically to produce a multicellular diploid [[sporophyte]]. The sporophyte creates spores via meiosis which ''also'' then divide mitotically producing haploid individuals called [[gametophyte]]s. The gametophytes produce gametes via mitosis. In some plants the gametophyte is not only small-sized but also short-lived; in other plants and many algae, the gametophyte is the "dominant" stage of the life cycle.

Haplodiplonts are:

* In [[archaeplastida]]ns: [[red algae]] (which have two sporophyte generations), some [[green algae]] (e.g., ''[[Ulva (genus)|Ulva]]''), [[Embryophyte|land plants]]&lt;ref name="Díaz" /&gt;
* In [[stramenopiles]]: most [[brown algae]]&lt;ref name="Díaz" /&gt;
* In [[rhizaria]]ns: many [[foraminiferan]]s,&lt;ref name="Ruppert" /&gt; [[plasmodiophoromycetes]]&lt;ref name="Díaz" /&gt;
* In [[amoebozoa]]: [[myxogastrid]]s
* In [[opisthokont]]s: some [[fungi]] (some [[chytrid]]s, some [[ascomycetes]] like the [[brewer's yeast]])&lt;ref name="Díaz" /&gt;
* Other eukaryotes: [[haptophyte]]s&lt;ref name="Ruppert" /&gt;

Some animals have a [[sex-determination system]] called [[haplodiploid]], but this is not related to the haplodiplontic life cycle.

== Vegetative meiosis ==
Some [[red algae]] (such as ''Bonnemaisonia''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/tandf/tejp/2009/00000044/00000003/art00012|title=Somatic meiosis in the life history of Bonnemaisonia asparagoides and Bonnemaisonia clavata (Bonnemaisoniales, Rhodophyta) from the Iberian peninsula|first1=Noemi|last1=Salvador Soler|first2=Amelia|last2=Gomez Garreta|first3=M.|last3=Antonia Ribera Siguan|date=1 August 2009|publisher=|journal=European Journal of Phycology|volume=44|issue=3|pages=381–393|via=IngentaConnect|doi=10.1080/09670260902780782}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Lemanea]]'') and green algae (such as ''[[Prasiola]]'') have '''vegetative meiosis''', also called '''somatic meiosis''', which is a rare phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;van den Hoek, C. et al. (1995), pp. 82, 453.&lt;/ref&gt; Vegetative meiosis can occur in haplodiplontic and also in diplontic life cycles. The gametophytes remain attached to and part of the sporophyte. Vegetative (non-reproductive) diploid cells undergo meiosis, generating vegetative haploid cells. These undergo many mitosis, and produces gametes.

A different phenomenon, called '''vegetative diploidization''', a type of [[apomixis]], occurs in some [[brown alga]]e (e.g., ''Elachista stellaris'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lewis, R.J.|year=1996|title=Chromosomes of the brown algae|journal=Phycologia|volume=35|issue=1|pages=19–40|doi=10.2216/i0031-8884-35-1-19.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cells in a haploid part of the plant spontaneously duplicate their chromosomes to produce diploid tissue.

==Evolution==
The primitive type of life cycle probably had haploid individuals with asexual reproduction.&lt;ref name="Ruppert" /&gt; [[Bacteria]] and [[archaea]] exhibit a life cycle like this, and some eukaryotes apparently do too (e.g., [[Cryptophyta]], [[Choanoflagellata]], many  [[Euglenozoa]], many [[Amoebozoa]], some red algae, some [[green algae]], the [[imperfect fungi]], some [[rotifer]]s and many other groups, not necessarily haploid).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Heywood, P. |author2=Magee, P.T. |year=1976|title=Meiosis in protists.

In [[biology]] and [[botany]], '''indeterminate growth''' is growth that is not terminated in contrast to '''determinate growth''' that stops once a genetically pre-determined structure has completely formed. Thus, a plant that grows and produces [[flower]]s and [[fruit]] until killed by frost or some other external factor is called indeterminate. For example, the term is applied to [[tomato]] varieties that grow in a rather gangly fashion, producing fruit throughout the growing season, and in contrast to a determinate tomato plant, which grows in a more bushy shape and is most productive for a single, larger harvest, then either tapers off with minimal new growth or fruit, or dies.

==Inflorescences==
In reference to an [[inflorescence]] (a shoot specialised for bearing flowers, and bearing no leaves other than [[bract]]s), an indeterminate type (such as a [[raceme]]) is one in which the first flowers to develop and open are from the buds at the base, followed progressively by buds nearer to the growing tip. The growth of the shoot is not impeded by the opening of the early flowers or development of fruits and its appearance is of growing, producing, and maturing flowers and fruit indefinitely. In practice the continued growth of the terminal end necessarily peters out sooner or later, though without producing any definite terminal flower, and in some species it may stop growing before any of the buds have opened. 

Not all plants produce indeterminate inflorescences however; some produce a definite terminal flower that terminates the development of new buds towards the tip of that inflorescence. In most species that produce a '''determinate'' inflorescence in this way, all of the flower buds are formed before the first ones begin to open, and all open more or less at the same time. In some species with determinate inflorescences however, the [[Inflorescence#Terminal flower|terminal flower]] blooms first, which stops the elongation of the main axis, but side buds develop lower down. One type of example is [[Dianthus]] another type is exemplified by [[Allium]] and yet others by [[Daucus]].

==Animals==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
In zoology, indeterminate growth refers to the condition where animals grow rapidly when young, and continue to grow after reaching adulthood although at a slower pace.&lt;ref name="pmid11675785"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = West GB, Brown JH, Enquist BJ | title = A general model for ontogenetic growth | journal = Nature | volume = 413 | issue = 6856 | pages = 628–31 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11675785 | doi = 10.1038/35098076 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common in fish, amphibians, reptiles, and many molluscs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Optimal allocation of resources explains interspecific life-history patterns in animals with indeterminate growth | author=Jan Kozłowski | journal=Proc.

B | year=1996 | volume=263 | pages=559–566 | doi=10.1098/rspb.1996.0084}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term also refers to the pattern of hair growth sometimes seen in humans and a few domestic breeds, where hair continues to grow in length until it is cut.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7358">'''Feminist biology''' is an approach to [[biology]] that is concerned with the influence of gender values, the removal of gender bias, and the understanding of the overall role of social values in biological research and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, Carla, "Feminist Philosophy of Biology", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist Biology, was founded by, among others, Dr. Ruth Bleier of the University of Wisconsin-Madison (who authored the 1984 work “Science and Gender: A Critique of Biology and Its Theories on Women” and inspired the university’s endowed fellowship for feminist biology),&lt;ref&gt;David, Tenembaum. "First in the Nation: UW-Madison Establishes Post-doc in Feminist Biology." University of Wisconsin-Madison News. University of Wisconsin-Madison, 17 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; it aims to enhance biology by incorporating feminist critique in matters varying from the mechanisms of cell biology and sex selection to the [[sex and gender distinction|assessment of the meaning of words such as “gender” and “sex.”]]
Overall, the field is broadly defined and pertains itself to philosophies behind both biological and feminist practice. These considerations make feminist biology debatable and conflictive with itself, particularly when concerning matters of [[biological determinism]], whereby descriptive sex terms of male and female are intrinsically confining, or extreme post-modernism, whereby the body is viewed more as a social construct.&lt;ref&gt;Dominguez, Johnna. "A Fine Line: Feminism and Biology." Club Antro: UA Anthropology Blog Network. University of Alabama, 27 Aug. 2012. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite opinions ranging from determinist to postmodernist, however, biologists, feminists, and feminist biologists of varying labels alike have made claims to the utility of applying feminist ideology to biological practice and procedure.
{{Feminism sidebar}}
==Contributions==
[[Donna J. Haraway]], a biologist and primatologist hailing from the University of California, put forth male bias criticisms in 1989 concerning the study of human evolution and culture via primatology by denoting a prominent lack of focus in female primates.&lt;ref&gt;Haraway, Donna Jeanne. Primate visions: Gender, race, and nature in the world of 
modern science. Psychology Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Haraway contributed to a large discovery of behaviors in primate groups regarding mate selection, and female-female interactions derived from observing female primates, citing feminist influences as she studied the female primates in their own merit.

Similarly, feminist cell biologists of The Biology and Gender Study Group have criticized androcentrism in the study of behavior between sexes and “come to look at feminist critique as [they] would any experimental control.”&lt;ref&gt;Biology and Gender Study Group, et al. "The Importance of Feminist Critique for Contemporary Cell Biology." Hypatia (1988): 61-76.&lt;/ref&gt; They cite a general trend of “active” biological description associated with the sperm gamete and “passive” description to the ovum, comparing such description to an archetypal hero facing many challenges before it finding its static, female home. The group criticized the diction employed by biological readings and textbooks, stating that the more active and risk-associated traits of the ovum (such as its own survival from the whittling of 2&amp;nbsp;million oocytes) are dismissed for the sake of a patterned narrative.

[[Anne Fausto-Sterling]], a professor of Biology and Gender Studies at Brown University, assesses the complexity of defining sex through a dichotomous lens in a variety of her works such as Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality as well as in an article piece she wrote titled “The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female Are Not Enough.” She addresses the existence of intersex individuals and the lack of acknowledgment of their state of being in the context of a dichotomously defined world of sexes – even, if not especially, by medical professionals and surgeons who understand intersex anatomy to a point to where they can surgically alter it to one of the sexes. She states: “Ironically, a more sophisticated knowledge of the complexity of sexual systems has led to the repression of such intricacy.”&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling, Anne. "The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female Are Not Enough." The Sciences Mar/Apr. 1993: 20-24. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Fausto-Sterling continues by advocating the reevaluation of what is considered urgent medical intervention in light of the influence she believes social stigma has had on standard medical procedure – which in turn could help open up the possible directions that science could take.

==Motivation==
The motivations of advocating feminist biology are diverse. One of the most common motivations is to challenge the gender biases originated from science, by discerning a more objective, scientific truth from culturally influenced practices.&lt;ref&gt;Schiebinger, Londa. 1999. Has Feminism Changed Science? Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many individuals argue the emergence and development of modern science involved the domination of a female world and the exclusion of women. [[Reductionism]], for instance, is a view that all matters in the universe are arranged hierarchically, and that causation only occurs at the lower levels of this hierarchy&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, Carla, "Mechanism without Reductionism", NWSA Journal, 16(1), 136-156.&lt;/ref&gt;. A tight link exists between reductive mechanistic science and [[biological determinism]], contributing to the argument that biological causes are the only causes, or the most important cause, of 'feminine' behavior. This link is due to the reductive assumption that causation acts in an upward direction from lower levels of organization to higher levels of organization&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, Carla, "Mechanism without Reductionism", NWSA Journal, 16(1), 136-156.&lt;/ref&gt;. Many feminist biologists focus on dispelling such stigmatic prejudices that influential figures have accepted as scientifically true. 

==Controversy==
There is an ongoing debate on whether a feminist critique should be incorporated in the sciences, especially biology. Some argue that feminist biology is a form of politicization of science, calling to question the legitimacy of feminist biology altogether. On another level, there is debate even within the feminist community on how to deal with biological sex differences. Some account on the importance of accepting biological sex differences to reach gender equality, while others contend that there sex differences are overly emphasized in society, contributing to gender stereotypes&lt;ref&gt;Londa Schiebinger, "Introduction," Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society 28, no. 3 (Spring 2003): 859-866.&lt;/ref&gt;. Individuals such as [[Carla Fehr]] offer constructive criticism for the future of feminist philosophy in the field of biology; she proposes feminist biologists to consider novel questions pertaining to subjects such as the research of genomics in relation to gender.&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, Carla, "Feminist Philosophy of Biology", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[FMRFamide]], a neuropeptide involved in cardiac activity regulation, is found in ''[[Biomphalaria glabrata]]'', a species of a [[freshwater snail]] best known for its role as the intermediate host for the human-infecting [[trematode]] parasite ''[[Schistosoma mansoni]]''.

This freshwater snail species is used as a [[model organism]], in other words, a [[non-human]] [[species]] which is extensively studied to understand a [[biology|biological]] phenomenon, with the expectation that discoveries made in the model will provide insight into the workings of other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fields S, Johnston M | title=Cell biology. Whither model organism research? | journal=Science | volume=307 | issue=5717 | pages=1885–6 | date=Mar 2005 | pmid=15790833 | doi=10.1126/science.1108872 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/307/5717/1885}}&lt;/ref&gt; Model organisms are [[in vivo]] models and are widely used to research human [[disease]] when [[human experimentation]] would be unfeasible or [[bioethics|unethical]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, E.

==Relevance==
This snail has been studied in relation to human pathology and the [[epidemiology]] of [[schistosomiasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Santama N, Benjamin PR |title=Gene expression and function of FMRFamide-related neuropeptides in the snail ''Lymnaea'' |journal=Microscopy Research Technology |volume=49 |issue=6 |pages=547–556 |date=June 2000 |doi= 10.1002/1097-0029(20000615)49:6&lt;547::aid-jemt5&gt;3.3.co;2-p |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''S. masoni'' is known to change its host’s (''B. glabrata'''s) behavior via the upregulation/downregulation of [[neuropeptide]]s such as [[schistosomin]] and NPY, and some studies have reported that FMRFamide is [[aminergic]], and may be implicated in the secretion of molecules to respond to infection with [[parasite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weinlander E, Humphries J |title=5-HT and FMRFamide in the embryonic central nervous system of Biomphalaria glabrata |journal=Lawrence University Honors Projects |date=May 2012 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ganglionic [[central nervous system]] (CNS) of ''B. glabrata'' consists of paired cerebral, pedal, pleural, parietal, and buccal ganglia, and one unpaired visceral ganglion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Darnell, J. E. |author2=Lodish, H. F. |author3= Baltimore, D. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Molecular cell biology. |journal=Scientific American Books |pages=302–312 |date=1990|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; FMRFamide is concentrated in the concentrated in the cerebral and visceral ganglia, although evidence from current research suggests that FMRFamide moves downward of the head-foot region of the snail as embryonic development proceeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kempf SC, Page LR, Pires A |title=Development of serotonin-like immunoreactivity in the embryos and larvae of nudibranch mollusks with emphasis on the structure and possible function of the apical sensory organ |journal=The Journal of Comparative Neurology |volume=386 |issue=3 |pages=507–528 |date=September 1997 |url= |doi=10.1002/(sici)1096-9861(19970929)386:3&lt;507::aid-cne12&gt;3.0.co;2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact role of FMRFamide during early development of the embryonic central nervous system is not well studied. Detection of this neuropeptide is important because its expression lays down the foundation of the CNS in the early stages of development in invertebrates. In recent years, neuromodulatory actions of FMRFamide in invertebrates have become more apparent. This is in part due to the extensive studies done on the Planorbidae and [[Lymnaeidae]] families of pond snails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bulloch AG, Price DA, Murphy AD, Lee TD, Bowes HN |title=FMRFamide peptides in Helisoma: identification and physiological actions at a peripheral synapse |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=3459–69 |date=September 1988 |pmid=3171684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FMRFamide expression in ''B. glabrata'' can be detected as early 72 hours, post-cleavage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weinlander E, Humphries J |title=5-HT and FMRFamide in the embryonic central nervous system of Biomphalaria glabrata |journal=Lawrence University Honors Projects |date=May 2012 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have shown its expression pattern in the posterior of the ganglionic nervous system, as the first FMRFamide immunoreactive cell appears at 25-28% of development and is located at the extreme posterior of the embryo. The cell sends a single process on each side and each process follows the body curvature.

As these processes elongate, two lateral FMRFamide-expressing cells are apparent on either side of the body wall. Some studies have suggested that FMRFamide these structures may innervate muscles that originate in trochopore larvae and expand during development. This neuromodulator helps to regulate cardiac activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=López-Vera E, Aguilar MB, Heimer de la Cotera EP | date = Feb 2008 | title = FMRFamide and related peptides in the phylum mollusca | url = | journal = Peptides | volume = 29 | issue = 2| pages = 310–7 | doi=10.1016/j.peptides.2007.09.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several FMRFamid related peptides are known, regulating various cellular functions and possessing pharmacological actions, such as anti-opiate effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rőszer T, Bánfalvi G | year = 2011 | title = FMRFamide-related peptides: Anti-opiate transmitters acting in apoptosis | url = | journal = Peptides | volume =  34| issue = | pages =  177–85| doi = 10.1016/j.peptides.2011.04.011 | pmid = 21524675 }}&lt;/ref&gt; FMRFamide may also play a role in osmoregulation and developmental patterning. This neuropeoptide has multiple functions and controls many processes that allow the embryo to mature into an adult snail.

==Immunocytochemistry of FMRFamide in ''B. glabrata'' embryos==

FMRFamide patterning over the course of embryonic life has been recorded through [[immunofluorescence]]. Embryos at 0 to 144 hours (6 days) post cleavage were extracted from the egg mass and fixed in 4% PFA for 2 hrs at room temperature.  Embryos older than 4 days were pre-treated with 0.5% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution in PBS for 5 minutes to improve primary antibody penetration, and then fixed in 4% PFA for 2 hours at room temperature. Embryos were then washed overnight in 4% Triton X-100 in PBS and incubated in blocking solution, 1% normal goal serum in PBS, overnight at 4&amp;nbsp;°C.

After blocking overnight, embryos were treated with a primary antibody solution at 1:2000 (in NGS/PBS). Secondary antibody tagged with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (polyclonal) was incubated at 1:20, overnight at 4&amp;nbsp;°C. Embryos were then mounted on a slide and viewed with fluorescent microscopy.

{{Evolutionary biology}}

'''Sociobiology''' is a field of [[biology]] that aims to examine and explain [[social behavior]] in terms of [[evolution]]. It draws from disciplines including [[ethology]], [[anthropology]], [[evolution]], [[zoology]], [[archaeology]], and [[population genetics]]. Within the study of human [[society|societies]], sociobiology is closely allied to [[Darwinian anthropology]], [[human behavioral ecology]] and [[evolutionary psychology]].

Sociobiology investigates social behaviors such as mating patterns, territorial fights, pack hunting, and the hive society of [[social insect]]s. It argues that just as selection pressure led to animals evolving useful ways of interacting with the natural environment, so also it led to the genetic evolution of advantageous social behavior.

While the term "sociobiology" originated at least as early as the 1940s, the concept did not gain major recognition until the publication of [[E. O. Wilson]]'s book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]'' in 1975. The new field quickly became the subject of [[scientific controversy|controversy]].  Critics, led by [[Richard Lewontin]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]], argued that genes played a role in human behavior, but that traits such as aggressiveness could be explained by social environment rather than by biology. Sociobiologists responded by pointing to the complex relationship between [[nature and nurture]].

==Definition==

E. O. Wilson defined sociobiology as "the extension of population biology and evolutionary theory to social organization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wilson, E. O. |authorlink=E. O. Wilson |year=1978 |title=On Human Nature |page=x |publisher=Harvard |isbn=978-0674016385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociobiology is based on the premise that some behaviors (social and individual) are at least partly inherited and can be affected by [[natural selection]]. It begins with the idea that behaviors have evolved over time, similar to the way that physical traits are thought to have evolved. It predicts that animals will act in ways that have proven to be evolutionarily successful over time. This can, among other things, result in the formation of complex social processes conducive to evolutionary fitness.

The discipline seeks to explain behavior as a product of natural selection. Behavior is therefore seen as an effort to preserve one's genes in the population. Inherent in sociobiological reasoning is the idea that certain genes or gene combinations that influence particular behavioral traits can be [[Heredity|inherited]] from generation to generation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rethinking The Theoretical Foundation of Sociobiology | author1=Wilson, David Sloan Wilson |author2=Wilson, Edward O. |author2link=E. O. Wilson | journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology | year=2007 | volume=82 | issue=4 | pages=327–348 | doi=10.1086/522809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, newly dominant male lions often kill cubs in the pride that they did not sire. This [[adaptive behaviour|behavior is adaptive]] because killing the cubs eliminates [[competition (biology)|competition]] for their own offspring and causes the nursing females to come into heat faster, thus allowing more of his genes to enter into the population. Sociobiologists would view this instinctual cub-killing behavior as being inherited through the genes of successfully reproducing male lions, whereas non-killing behavior may have died out as those lions were less successful in reproducing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Packer |first1=Craig |last2=Pusey |first2=Anne E. |title=Adaptations of Female Lions to Infanticide by Incoming Males |journal=Am. Nat.|date=1983 |volume=121 |issue=5 |pages=716–728 |url=https://www.cbs.umn.edu/sites/cbs.umn.edu/files/public/downloads/Adaptations_of_female_lions_to_infanticide.pdf |doi=10.1086/284097}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Plos wilson.jpg|upright|thumb|[[E. O. Wilson]], a central figure in the history of sociobiology, from the publication in 1975 of his book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]'']]

The philosopher of biology [[Daniel Dennett]] suggested that the political philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] was the first sociobiologist, arguing that in his 1651 book ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' Hobbes had explained the origins of morals in human society from an amoral sociobiological perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, Daniel |authorlink=Daniel Dennett |title=Darwin's Dangerous Idea |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1995 |pages=453–454 |isbn=978-0140167344}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The geneticist of animal behavior [[John Paul Scott (geneticist)|John Paul Scott]] coined the word ''sociobiology'' at a 1948 conference on genetics and social behaviour which called for a conjoint development of field and laboratory studies in animal behavior research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Life of J.P. Scott |url=https://www.bgsu.edu/arts-and-sciences/neuroscience/john-paul-scott/the-life-of-jp-scott.html |publisher=Bowling Green State University |accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levallois 2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levallois |first1=Clement |title=The Development of Sociobiology in Relation to Animal Behavior Studies, 1946–1975 |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |date=2018 |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=419–444 |doi=10.1007/s10739-017-9491-x|pmid=28986758 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. With John Paul Scott's organizational efforts, a  "Section of Animal Behavior and Sociobiology" of the ESA was created in 1956, which became a Division of Animal Behavior of the American Society of Zoology in 1958. In 1956, [[E. O. Wilson]] came in contact this emerging sociobiology through his PhD student Stuart A. Altmann, who had been in close relation with the participants to the 1948 conference. Altmann developed his own brand of sociobiology to study the social behavior of rhesus macaques, using statistics, and was hired as a "sociobiologist" at the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center in 1965.&lt;ref name="Levallois 2018"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Wilson's sociobiology is different from [[John Paul Scott (geneticist)|John Paul Scott]]'s or Altmann's, insofar as he drew on mathematical models of social behavior centered on the maximisation of the genetic fitness by [[W. D. Hamilton]], [[Robert Trivers]], [[John Maynard Smith]], and [[George R. Price]]. The three sociobiologies by Scott, Altmann and Wilson have in common to place naturalist studies at the core of the research on animal social behavior and by drawing alliances with emerging research methodologies, at a time when "biology in the field" was threatened to be made old-fashioned by "modern" practices of science (laboratory studies, mathematical biology, molecular biology).&lt;ref name=Dobzhansky1966&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dobzhansky |first1=Theodosius |title=Are Naturalists Old-Fashioned? |journal=The American Naturalist |date=September 1966 |volume=100 |issue=915 |pages=541–550 |doi=10.1086/282448}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levallois 2018"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a specialist term, "sociobiology" became widely known in 1975 when Wilson published his book ''Sociobiology: The New Synthesis'', which sparked an intense controversy. Since then "sociobiology" has largely been equated with Wilson's vision. The book pioneered and popularized the attempt to explain the evolutionary mechanics behind social behaviors such as [[altruism]], [[aggression]], and nurturance, primarily in ants (Wilson's own research specialty) and other [[Hymenoptera]], but also in other animals. However, the influence of evolution on behavior has been of interest to biologists and philosophers since soon after the discovery of evolution itself. [[Peter Kropotkin]]'s ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'', written in the early 1890s, is a popular example. The final chapter of the book is devoted to sociobiological explanations of human behavior, and Wilson later wrote a [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning book, ''[[On Human Nature]]'', that addressed human behavior specifically.&lt;ref name="Levallois 2018"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Walsh, Bryan | url=http://entertainment.time.com/2011/08/30/all-time-100-best-nonfiction-books/slide/on-human-nature-by-edward-o-wilson/ | title=All-TIME 100 Nonfiction Books |date=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward H. Hagen writes in ''The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology'' that sociobiology is, despite the public controversy regarding the applications to humans, "one of the scientific triumphs of the twentieth century." "Sociobiology is now part of the core research and curriculum of virtually all biology departments, and it is a foundation of the work of almost all field biologists" Sociobiological research on nonhuman organisms has increased dramatically and continuously in the world's top scientific journals such as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''. The more general term [[behavioral ecology]] is commonly substituted for the term sociobiology in order to avoid the public controversy.&lt;ref name="Evolutionary Psychology 2005"&gt;The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, edited by David M. Buss, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2005. Chapter 5 by Edward H. Hagen &lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Sociobiologists maintain that [[Human nature|human behavior]], as well as nonhuman animal behavior, can be partly explained as the outcome of natural selection. They contend that in order to fully understand behavior, it must be analyzed in terms of evolutionary considerations.

[[Natural selection]] is fundamental to evolutionary theory. Variants of hereditary traits which increase an organism's ability to survive and reproduce will be more greatly represented in subsequent generations, i.e., they will be "selected for". Thus, inherited behavioral mechanisms that allowed an [[organism]] a greater chance of surviving and/or reproducing in the past are more likely to survive in present organisms. That inherited adaptive behaviors are present in nonhuman [[Species|animal species]] has been multiply demonstrated by biologists, and it has become a foundation of [[evolutionary biology]]. However, there is continued resistance by some researchers over the application of evolutionary models to humans, particularly from within the social sciences, where culture has long been assumed to be the predominant driver of behavior.

[[File:Nikolaas Tinbergen 1978.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Nikolaas Tinbergen]], whose work influenced sociobiology]]

Sociobiology is based upon two fundamental premises:
* Certain behavioral traits are inherited,
* Inherited behavioral traits have been honed by natural selection. Therefore, these traits were probably "adaptive" in the environment in which the species evolved.

Sociobiology uses [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]]'s [[Tinbergen's four questions|four categories of questions]] and explanations of animal behavior. Two categories are at the species level; two, at the individual level. The species-level categories (often called "ultimate explanations") are
* the function (i.e., [[adaptation]]) that a behavior serves and
* the evolutionary process (i.e., [[phylogeny]]) that resulted in this functionality.
The individual-level categories (often called "proximate explanations") are
* the development of the individual (i.e., [[ontogeny]]) and
* the proximate mechanism (e.g., [[brain anatomy]] and [[hormone]]s).

Sociobiologists are interested in how behavior can be explained logically as a result of selective pressures in the history of a species. Thus, they are often interested in [[instinct]]ive, or [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] behavior, and in explaining the similarities, rather than the differences, between cultures. For example, mothers within many species of [[mammals]] – including humans – are very protective of their [[offspring]]. Sociobiologists reason that this protective behavior likely evolved over time because it helped the offspring of the individuals which had the characteristic to survive. This parental protection would increase in frequency in the population. The social behavior is believed to have evolved in a fashion similar to other types of nonbehavioral [[adaptation]]s, such as a coat of fur, or the sense of smell.

Individual genetic advantage fails to explain certain social behaviors as a result of gene-centred selection. E.O. Wilson argued that evolution may also act upon [[social group|groups]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1975. Chapter 5. "Group Selection and Altruism"&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanisms responsible for [[group selection]] employ [[paradigms]] and population statistics borrowed from [[evolutionary game theory]]. Altruism is defined as "a concern for the welfare of others". If altruism is genetically determined, then altruistic individuals must reproduce their own altruistic genetic traits for altruism to survive, but when altruists lavish their resources on non-altruists at the expense of their own kind, the altruists tend to die out and the others tend to increase. An extreme example is a soldier losing his life trying to help a fellow soldier. This example raises the question of how altruistic genes can be passed on if this soldier dies without having any children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tessman |first=Irwin |title=Human altruism as a courtship display |journal=Forum |year=1995 |pages=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within sociobiology, a social behavior is first explained as a sociobiological [[hypothesis]] by finding an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]] that matches the observed behavior. Stability of a strategy can be difficult to prove, but usually, it will predict gene frequencies. The hypothesis can be supported by establishing a correlation between the gene frequencies predicted by the strategy, and those expressed in a population.

Altruism between [[social insect]]s and littermates has been explained in such a way. Altruistic behavior, behavior that increases the reproductive fitness of others at the apparent expense of the altruist, in some animals has been correlated to the degree of [[genome]] shared between altruistic individuals. A quantitative description of [[infanticide]] by male harem-mating animals when the [[alpha male]] is displaced as well as [[rodent]] female infanticide and fetal resorption are active areas of study. In general, females with more bearing opportunities may value offspring less, and may also arrange bearing opportunities to maximize the [[food]] and protection from mates.

An important concept in sociobiology is that temperament traits exist in an [[ecological]] balance. Just as an expansion of a [[sheep]] population might encourage the expansion of a [[wolf]] population, an expansion of altruistic traits within a gene pool may also encourage increasing numbers of individuals with dependent traits.

Studies of human behavior genetics have generally found behavioral traits such as creativity, extroversion, aggressiveness, and [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] have high [[heritability]]. The researchers who carry out those studies are careful to point out that heritability does not constrain the influence that environmental or cultural factors may have on those traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Wendy |last2=Turkheimer |first2=E. |last3=Gottesman |first3=Irving |last4=Bouchard |first4=Thomas |year=2009 |title=Beyond Heritability: Twin Studies in Behavioral Research |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=217–220 |url=http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/Articles%20for%20Online%20CV/Johnson%20%282009%29.pdf |accessdate=29 June 2010 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01639.x |pmc=2899491 |pmid=20625474 |quote=Moreover, even highly heritable traits can be strongly manipulated by the environment, so heritability has little if anything to do with controllability.

Almost everyone who has ever thought about heritability has reached a commonsense intuition about it: One way or another, heritability has to be some kind of index of how genetic a trait is. That intuition explains why so many thousands of heritability coefficients have been calculated over the years. . . . Unfortunately, that fundamental intuition is wrong. Heritability isn't an index of how genetic a trait is. A great deal of time has been wasted in the effort of measuring the heritability of traits in the false expectation that somehow the genetic nature of psychological phenomena would be revealed. |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crime|Criminality]] is actively under study, but extremely controversial. There are arguments that in some environments criminal behavior might be adaptive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/OldArchive/bbs.mealey.html The Sociobiology Of Sociopathy: An Integrated&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021026131543/http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/OldArchive/bbs.mealey.html |date=2002-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The novelist [[Elias Canetti]] also has noted applications of sociobiological theory to cultural practices such as slavery and autocracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elias Canetti]], ''[[Crowds and Power]]''. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1981, p. 444-445.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support for premise==
Genetic mouse mutants illustrate the power that genes exert on behaviour. For example, the [[transcription factor]] FEV (aka Pet1), through its role in maintaining the [[serotonergic system]] in the brain, is required for normal [[aggression|aggressive]] and [[anxiety]]-like behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Hendricks TJ, Fyodorov DV, Wegman LJ, Lelutiu NB, Pehek EA, Yamamoto B, Silver J, Weeber EJ, Sweatt JD, Deneris ES. Pet-1 ETS gene plays a critical role in 5-HT neuron development and is required for normal anxiety-like and aggressive behaviour]. Neuron. 2003 Jan 23;37(2):233-47&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when FEV is genetically deleted from the mouse genome, male mice will instantly attack other males, whereas their wild-type counterparts take significantly longer to initiate violent behaviour. In addition, FEV has been shown to be required for correct maternal behaviour in mice, such that offspring of mothers without the FEV factor do not survive unless cross-fostered to other wild-type female mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lerch-Haner | first1 = JK | last2 = Frierson | first2 = D | last3 = Crawford | first3 = LK | last4 = Beck | first4 = SG | last5 = Deneris | first5 = ES | date = Sep 2008 | title = Serotonergic transcriptional programming determines maternal behavior and offspring survival | url = | journal = Nat Neurosci | volume = 11 | issue = 9| pages = 1001–3 | doi=10.1038/nn.2176| pmid = 19160496 | pmc = 2679641 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A genetic basis for instinctive behavioural traits among non-human species, such as in the above example, is commonly accepted among many biologists; however, attempting to use a genetic basis to explain complex behaviours in human societies has remained extremely controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fisher |first1=Helen |title='Wilson,' They Said, 'Your All Wet!' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/12/06/specials/wilson-naturalist.html |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=21 July 2015 |date=16 October 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gould |first1=Stephen Jay |title=Sociobiology: the art of storytelling |journal=New Scientist |date=16 November 1978 |volume=80 |issue=1129 |pages=530–533|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tRj7EyRFVqYC&amp;pg=PA530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

[[Steven Pinker]] argues that critics have been overly swayed by politics and a fear of [[biological determinism]],{{efn|Biological determinism was a right wing philosophy underlying the [[social Darwinism|social Darwinian]] and [[Eugenics#History|eugenics movements]] of the early 20th century, and [[History of the race and intelligence controversy|controversies in the history of intelligence testing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=Garland E. |title=The Roots of Biological Determinism: review of The Mismeasure of Man by Stephen Jay Gould |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |date=1984 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=141–145 |jstor=4330882 |doi=10.1007/bf00397505}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} accusing among others [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Richard Lewontin]] of being "radical scientists", whose stance on human nature is influenced by politics rather than science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pinker, Steven | authorlink=Steven Pinker |title=The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York |year=2002 |page=149 |isbn=978-0-14-200334-3 |quote=A surprising number of intellectuals, particularly on the left, do deny that there is such a thing as inborn talent, especially intelligence. Stephen Jay Gould's 191 bestseller ''The Mismeasure of Man'' was written to debunk 'the abstraction of intelligence as a single entity ... and the use of these numbers to rank people in a single series of worthiness'| title-link=The Blank Slate }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Lewontin, [[Steven Rose]] and [[Leon Kamin]] who drew a distinction between the politics and history of an idea and its scientific validity&lt;ref name=lrk84&gt;{{cite book |author1=Richard Lewontin |author2=Leon Kamin |author3=Steven Rose | title=Not in Our Genes: Biology, Ideology, and Human Nature | publisher=Pantheon Books | year=1984 | isbn=978-0-394-50817-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that sociobiology fails on scientific grounds. Gould grouped sociobiology with [[eugenics]], criticizing both in his book ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gould, Stephen Jay |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |year=1996 |title=The Mismeasure of Man |page=Introduction to the Revised Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Noam Chomsky]] has expressed views on sociobiology on several occasions. During a 1976 meeting of the [[Sociobiology Study Group]], as reported by [[Ullica Segerstråle]], Chomsky argued for the importance of a sociobiologically informed notion of human nature.{{sfn|Segerstråle|2000|p=205}} Chomsky argued that human beings are biological organisms and ought to be studied as such, with his criticism of the "[[blank slate]]" doctrine in the social sciences (which would inspire a great deal of Steven Pinker's and others' work in evolutionary psychology), in his 1975 ''Reflections on Language''.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam (1975), ''Reflections on Language'':10. New York: Pantheon Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky further hinted at the possible reconciliation of his anarchist political views and sociobiology in a discussion of [[Peter Kropotkin]]'s ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'', which focused more on altruism than aggression, suggesting that anarchist societies were feasible because of an innate human tendency to cooperate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky, Noam]] (1995). [http://www.chomsky.info/articles/199505--.htm#TXT2.23 "Rollback, Part II."] ''Z Magazine'' 8 (Feb.): 20–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson has claimed that he had never meant to imply what ''ought'' to be, only what ''is'' the case. However, some critics have argued that the language of sociobiology readily slips from "is" to "ought",&lt;ref name=lrk84/&gt; an instance of the [[naturalistic fallacy]]. Pinker has argued that opposition to stances considered anti-social, such as [[ethnic nepotism]], is based on [[morality|moral]] assumptions, meaning that such opposition is not [[falsifiable]] by scientific advances.&lt;ref name=Pinker2002&gt;[[Steven Pinker|Pinker, Steven]] (2002). ''The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature''. New York: Viking. p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; The history of this debate, and others related to it, are covered in detail by {{harvtxt|Cronin|1993}}, {{harvtxt|Segerstråle|2000}}, and {{harvtxt|Alcock|2001}}.

'''Encapsulin nanocompartments''', or '''encapsulin protein cages''', are spherical bacterial organelle-like compartments roughly 25-30&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter that are involved in various aspects of metabolism, in particular protecting bacteria from oxidative stress.

'''Pursuit predation''' is a form of [[predation]] in which predators give chase to fleeing prey. The chase can be initiated either by the predator or by the prey, should the prey be alerted to a predator's presence and attempt to flee before the predator gives chase. The chase ends when either the predator captures and consumes the prey, or the prey escapes. Pursuit predation is typically observed in carnivorous species within the kingdom [[Animalia Kingdom|Animalia]], with some iconic examples being [[cheetah]]s, [[lion]]s, and [[Gray wolf|wolves]].

Pursuit predation is an alternate predation strategy to [[ambush predation]]. While pursuit predators use a detection and pursuit phase in order to obtain prey, ambush predators use stealth to capture prey. Strength and speed are important to pursuit predators, whereas ambush predators ignore these in favor of surprise from a typically concealed location. While the two patterns of predation are not mutually exclusive, morphological differences in body plan can create a bias in an organism towards each type of predation.

== Strategy ==
There is still uncertainty as to whether predators behave with a general tactic or strategy while preying.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Combes | first1 = SA | last2 = Salcedo | first2 = MK | last3 = Pandit | first3 = MM | last4 = Iwasaki | first4 = JM | year = 2013 | title = Capture Success and Efficiency of Dragonflies Pursuing Different Types of Prey | url = | journal = Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume =  53| issue = 5| pages = 787–798 | doi=10.1093/icb/ict072 | pmid=23784698}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, among pursuit predators, there are several common behaviors. Often, predators will scout potential prey, assessing prey quantity and density prior to engaging in a pursuit. Certain predators choose to pursue prey primarily in a group of conspecifics; such animals are known as [[pack hunter]]s or group pursuers. Other species choose to hunt alone. These two behaviors are typically due to differences in hunting success, where some groups are very successful in groups and others are more successful alone. Pursuit predators may also choose to either exhaust their metabolic resources rapidly &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = CR | last2 = Rowntree | first2 = VJ | year = 1973 | title = Temperature regulation and heat balance in running cheetahs: A strategy for sprinters? | url = | journal = Am J Physiol | volume = 224 | issue = 4| pages = 848–851 | doi = 10.1152/ajplegacy.1973.224.4.848 | pmid = 4698801 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or pace themselves during a chase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Creel | first1 = S. | last2 = Creel | first2 = N.

Predators that rapidly exhaust their metabolic resources during a chase tend to first stalk their prey, slowly approaching their prey to decrease chase distance and time. When the predator is at a closer distance (one that would lead to easier prey capture), it finally gives chase.&lt;ref&gt;Mech, D. (1970). The Wolf: The Ecology and Behaviour of an Endangered Species. Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Pacing pursuit is more commonly seen in group pursuit, as individual animals do not need to exert as much energy to capture prey. However, this type of pursuit requires group coordination, which may have varying degrees of success. Since groups can engage in longer chases, they often focus on separating a weaker or slower prey item during pursuit.&lt;ref&gt;Kruuk, H. (1972) ''The Spotted Hyena''. University of Chicago Press, Chicago IL''''&lt;/ref&gt; Morphologically speaking, while ambush predation requires stealth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = DeVries | first1 = M.S. | last2 = Murphy | first2 = E.A.K. | last3 = Patek | first3 = S.N. | year = 2012 | title = Strike mechanics of an ambush predator: the spearing mantis shrimp | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 215 | issue = Pt 24| pages = 4374–4384 | doi=10.1242/jeb.075317 | pmid=23175528}}&lt;/ref&gt; pursuit predation requires speed; pursuit predators are proportionally long-limbed and equipped with cursorial adaptations.&lt;ref name="Janis" /&gt; Current theories suggest that this proportionally long-limbed approach to body plan was an evolutionary countermeasure to prey adaptation.&lt;ref name = "Janis"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Janis | first1 = C.

==Group pursuers==

===Vertebrates===
[[File:Three dolphins.png|thumb|upright=1.6|A small pod of dolphins]]
Group pursuers hunt with a collection of conspecifics. Group pursuit is usually seen in species of relatively high [[sociality]]; in vertebrates, individuals often seem to have defined roles in pursuit.

==== Mammals ====
[[African wild dog]] (''Lycaon pictus'') packs have been known to split into several smaller groups while in pursuit; one group initiates the chase, while the other travels ahead of the prey's escape path. The group of chase initiators coordinate their chase to lead the prey towards the location of the second group, where the prey's escape path will be effectively cut off.&lt;ref&gt;Natural World Safaris. (2015, October 16). In 10 interesting facts about African wild dogs.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bottlenose dolphin]]s (''Tursiops'') have been shown exhibiting similar behaviors of pursuit role specialization. One group within the dolphin pod, known as the drivers, give chase to the fish - forcing the fish into a tight circle formation, while the other group of the pod, the barriers, approach the fish from the opposite direction. This two-pronged attack leaves the fish with only the option of jumping out of the water to escape the dolphins. However, the fish are completely vulnerable in the air; it is at this point when the dolphins leap out and catch the fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gazda | first1=S.

Many observations of group pursuers note an optimal hunting size in which certain currencies (mass of prey killed or number of prey killed) are maximized with respect to costs (kilometers covered or injuries sustained).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Holekamp | first1=K.

==== Birds ====
While birds are generally believed to be individual hunters, there are a few examples of birds that cooperate during pursuits. [[Harris's hawk]]s (''Parabuteo unicinctus'') have two cooperative strategies for hunting. One strategy involves a group of hawks surrounding prey hidden under some form of cover, while another hawk attempts to penetrate the prey's cover. The penetration attempt flushes the prey out from its cover where it is swiftly killed by one of the surrounding hawks. The second strategy is less commonly used. It involves a "relay attack" in which a group of hawks, led by a "lead" hawk, engage in a long chase for prey. The "lead" hawk will dive in order to kill the prey. If the dive is unsuccessful, the role of the "lead" shifts to another hawk who will then dive in another attempt to kill the prey. During one observed relay attack, 20 dives and hence 20 lead switches were exhibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bednarz | first1=J. C. | year=1988 | title=Cooperative Hunting in Harris' Hawks (Parabuteo unicinctus) | journal=Science | volume=239 | issue=4847| pages=1525–1527 | doi=10.1126/science.239.4847.1525 | pmid=17772751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invertebrates===
[[File:Asian Giant Hornet (Vespa mandarinia) (6027759338).jpg|thumb|Asian Giant Hornet (''Vespa mandarinia'')|170x170px]]

As in vertebrates, there are many species of invertebrates which actively pursue prey in groups and exhibit task specialization, but while the vertebrates change their behavior based on their role in hunting, invertebrate task delegation is usually based on actual morphological differences. The vast majority of [[Eusociality|eusocial]] [[insect]]s have castes within a population which tend to differ in size and have specialized structures for different tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Ecology and Evolution of Social Organization: Insights from Fire Ants and Other Highly Eusocial Insects|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|date=1995-01-01|pages=631–656|volume=26|first=Kenneth G.|last=Ross|first2=Laurent|last2=Keller|jstor=2097222|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.26.1.631|url=https://serval.unil.ch/notice/serval:BIB_978B777C54B0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This differentiation is taken to the extreme in the groups [[Termite|isoptera]] and [[hymenoptera]], or termites and [[ant]]s, [[bee]]s, and [[wasp]]s respectively.

[[File:Matabele Ants (Pachycondyla sp.) carrying dead termites (13848808434).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Matabele Ants (''Pachycondyla sp.'') carrying dead [[termite]]s]]

[[Termite]]-hunting ants of the genus ''[[Pachycondyla]]'', also known as Matabele ants, form raiding parties consisting of ants of different castes, such as soldier ants and worker ants.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Behavioral ecology of the neotropical termite-hunting ant Pachycondyla (= Termitopone) marginata: colony founding, group-raiding and migratory patterns|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|date=1995-12-01|issn=0340-5443|pages=373–383|volume=37|issue=6|doi=10.1007/BF00170584|first=Inara R.|last=Leal|first2=Paulo S.|last2=Oliveira}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soldier ants are much larger than worker ants, with more powerful mandibles and more robust [[exoskeleton]]s, and so they make up the front lines of raiding parties and are responsible for killing prey. Workers usually butcher and carry off the killed prey, while supporting the soldiers. The raiding parties are highly mobile and move aggressively into the colonies of termites, often breaking through their outer defenses and entering their mounds. The ants do not completely empty the mound of termites, instead they only take a few, allowing the termites to recover their numbers so that the ants have a steady stream of prey.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Asian giant hornet]]s, ''Vespa mandarinia'', form similar raiding parties to hunt their prey, which usually consists of [[Honey bee|honeybees.]]&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Heat and carbon dioxide generated by honeybees jointly act to kill hornets|journal=Naturwissenschaften|date=2009-06-24|issn=0028-1042|pages=1133–1136|volume=96|issue=9|doi=10.1007/s00114-009-0575-0|first=Michio|last=Sugahara|first2=Fumio|last2=Sakamoto|pmid=19551367}}&lt;/ref&gt; The giant hornets group together and as a team can decimate an entire honeybee colony, especially those of non-native European honeybees. Alone, the hornets are subject to attack by the smaller bees, who swarm the hornet and vibrate their abdomens to generate heat, collectively cooking the hornet until it dies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; By hunting in groups, the hornets avoid this problem.

[[File:Cheetah chasing Thompsons gazelle (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.75&lt;!--fmt for low img--&gt;|Cheetah chasing Thomson's gazelle]]

While most big cat species are individual, ambush predators, [[Cheetahs]] (''Acinonyx jubatus'') are pursuit predators. Widely known as the fastest terrestrial animal, with speeds reaching 61–64 miles per hour, cheetahs take advantage of their speed during chases.&lt;ref&gt;"10 Fastest Animals On Earth - Fastest Animals In The World." Conservation Institute. N.p., 06 Apr. 2014. Web. 16 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Sharp | first1=N. C. | year=2009 | title=Timed running speed of a cheetah | url=| journal=Journal of Zoology | volume=241 | issue=3| pages=493–494 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1997.tb04840.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their speed and acceleration also have disadvantages, as both can only be sustained for short periods of time. Studies show that cheetahs can maintain maximum speed for a distance of approximately 500 yards.&lt;ref&gt;"How Fast Can Cheetah Run | Cheetah Built For Speed | Cheetah Serengeti." Barking Zebra Tours. N.p., 27 Sept. 2013. Web. 16 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these limitations, cheetahs are often observed running at moderate speeds during chases. There are claims that the key to cheetahs' pursuit success may not be just their speed. Cheetahs are extremely agile, able to maneuver and change directions at very high speeds in very short amounts of time. This extensive maneuverability can make up for unsustainable high speed pursuit, as it allows cheetahs to quickly close the distance between prey without decreasing their speed when prey change direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Wilson | first1=A.

==== Birds ====
The [[Painted redstart]] (''Myioborus pictus'') is one of the most well documented flush pursuers. When flies, prey for redstarts, are alerted of the presence of predators, they respond by fleeing. Redstarts take advantage of this anti-predator response by spreading and orienting their easily noticeable wings and tails, alerting the flies, but only when they are in a position where the flies' escape path intersects with the redstart's central field of vision. When prey's path are in this field of vision, the redstart's prey capture rate is at it maximum. Once the flies begin to flee, the redstart begins to chase. It has been proposed that redstarts exploit two aspects of the visual sensitivity of their prey: sensitivity to the location of the stimulus in the prey's visual field and sensitivity to the direction of stimulus environment.&lt;ref name="Jablonski, P. G 2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Jablonski | first1=P.

G 2001"/&gt;

===Invertebrates===
[[File:Gomphus vulgatissimus with a prey 002.jpg|thumb|[[Dragonfly]] with prey]]

[[Dragonflies]] are skilled aerial pursuers; they have a 97% success rate for prey capture.&lt;ref&gt;Olberg RM, Worthington AH, Venator KR J Comp Physiol A. 2000 Feb; 186(2):155-62.&lt;/ref&gt; This success rate is a consequence of the "decision" oon which prey to pursue, based on initial conditions. Observations of several species of perching dragonflies show more pursuit initiations at larger starting distances for larger size prey species than for much smaller prey. Further evidence points to a potential bias towards larger prey, due to more substantial metabolic rewards. This bias is in spite of the fact that larger prey are typically faster and choosing them results in less successful pursuits. Dragonflies high success rate for prey capture may also be due to their interception foraging method.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Unlike [[classical pursuit]], in which the predator aims for the current position of their prey, dragonflies predict the prey's direction of motion,&lt;ref name="Gonzalez-Bellido Peng Yang Georgopoulos pp. 696–701"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gonzalez-Bellido | first=P.

Perching dragonflies ([[Libellulidae]] family), have been observed "staking out" high density prey spots prior to pursuit.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; There are no noticeable distinctions in prey capture efficiency between males and females. Further, percher dragonflies are bound by their visual range. They are more likely to engage in pursuit when prey come within a subtended angle of around 1-2 degrees. Angles greater than this are outside of a dragonflies visual range.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Evolutionary basis of the behavior ==

=== Evolution as a countermeasure ===
Current theory on the evolution of pursuit predation suggests that the behavior is an evolutionary countermeasure to prey adaptation. Prey animals vary in their likelihood to avoid predation, and it is predation failure that drives evolution of both prey and predator.&lt;ref name = "Vermeij"&gt;Geerat Vermeij, The American Naturalist
Vol. 120, No. 6 (Dec., 1982), pp. 701-720&lt;/ref&gt; Predation failure rates vary wildly across the animal kingdom; raptorial birds can fail anywhere from 20% to 80% of the time in predation, while predatory mammals usually fail more than half the time.&lt;ref name="Vermeij" /&gt; Prey adaptation drives these low rates in three phases: the detection phase, the pursuit phase, and the resistance phase.&lt;ref name = "Holling"&gt;Holling, C. S. (1966). The functional response of invertebrate predators to prey density. Memoirs of the Entomological Society of Canada, 98(S48), 5-86.&lt;/ref&gt; The pursuit phase drove the evolution of distinct behaviors for pursuit predation. [[File:Phases of Pursuit Predation.jpg|thumb|Phases of Pursuit Predation]]
As selective pressure on prey is higher than on predators &lt;ref name="Vermeij" /&gt; adaptation usually occurs in prey long before the reciprocal adaptations in predators. Evidence in the fossil record supports this, with no evidence of modern pursuit predators until the late Tertiary period.&lt;ref name="Janis"/&gt; Certain adaptations, like long limbs in ungulates, that were thought to be adaptive for speed against predatory behavior have been found to predate predatory animals by over 20 million years. Because of this, modern pursuit predation is an adaptation that may have evolved separately and much later as a need for more energy in colder and more arid climates.&lt;ref name="Janis" /&gt; Longer limbs in predators, the key morphological adaptation required for lengthy pursuit of prey, is tied in the fossil record to the late Tertiary. It is now believed that modern pursuit predators like the wolf and lion evolved this behavior around this time period as a response to ungulates increasing feeding range.&lt;ref name="Janis" /&gt; As ungulate prey moved into a wider feeding range to discover food in response to changing climate, predators evolved the longer limbs and behavior necessary to pursue prey across larger ranges. In this respect, pursuit predation is not co-evolutionary with prey adaptation, but a direct response to prey. Prey's adaptation to climate is the key formative reason for evolving the behavior and morphological necessities of pursuit predation.

In addition to serving as a countermeasure to prey adaptation, pursuit predation has evolved in some species as an alternative, facultative mechanism for foraging. For example, [[polar bear]]s typically act as specialized predators of [[Pinniped|seal]] pups and operate in a manner closely predicted by the [[optimal foraging theory]]. However, they have been seen to occasionally employ more energy-inefficient pursuit predation tactics on flightless geese. This alternative predatory strategy may serve as a back-up resource when optimal foraging is circumstantially impossible, or may even be a function of filling dietary needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Iles | first1 = D. T. | last2 = Peterson | first2 = S. L. | last3 = Gormezano | first3 = L. J. | last4 = Koons | first4 = D. N. | last5 = Rockwell | first5 = R.

=== Evolution from an ecological basis ===
Pursuit predation revolves around a distinct movement interaction between predator and prey; as prey move to find new foraging areas, predators should move with them. Predators congregate in areas of high prey density,&lt;ref name = "Krebs"&gt;Krebs, J. R. (1978). Optimal foraging: decision rules for predators. Behavioural ecology: an evolutionary approach, 23-63.&lt;/ref&gt; and prey should therefore avoid these areas.&lt;ref name = "Sih"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sih | first1 = Andrew | year = 1984 | title = The Behavioral Response Race Between Predator and Prey | url = | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 123 | issue = 1| pages = 143–150 | doi=10.1086/284193}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, dilution factor may be a reason to stay in areas of high density due to a decreased risk of predation. Given the movements of predators over ranges in pursuit predation, though, dilution factor seems a less important cause for predation avoidance. Because of these interactions, spatial patterns of predators and prey are important in preserving population size. Attempts by prey to avoid predation and find food are coupled with predator attempts to hunt and compete with other predators. These interactions act to preserve populations.&lt;ref name = "Li"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = Z. Z. | last2 = Gao | first2 = M. | last3 = Hui | first3 = C. | last4 = Han | first4 = X. Z. | last5 = Shi | first5 = H. | year = 2005 | title = Impact of predator pursuit and prey evasion on synchrony and spatial patterns in metapopulation | url = | journal = Ecological Modelling | volume = 185 | issue = 2| pages = 245–254 | doi=10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2004.12.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Models of spatial patterns and synchrony of predator-prey relationships can be used as support for the evolution of pursuit predation as one mechanism to preserve these population mechanics. By pursuing prey over long distances, predators actually improve longterm survival of both their own population and prey population through population synchrony. Pursuit predation acts to even out population fluctuations by moving predatory animals from areas of high predator density to low predator density, and low prey density to high prey density. This keeps migratory populations in synchrony, which increases metapopulation persistence.&lt;ref name="Li"/&gt; Pursuit predation’s effect on population persistence is more marked over larger travel ranges. Predator and prey levels are usually more synchronous in predation over larger ranges, as population densities have more ability to even out.&lt;ref name = "Leggett"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rose | first1 = G. A. | last2 = Leggett | first2 = W. C. | year = 1990 | title = The importance of scale to predator-prey spatial correlations: an example of Atlantic fishes | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 71| issue = 1| pages = 33–43 | doi=10.2307/1940245| jstor = 1940245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pursuit predation can then be supported as an adaptive mechanism for not just individual feeding success but also [[metapopulation]] persistence.

==Anti-predator adaptation to pursuit predation==

===Anti-predator adaptation===
{{further|Anti-predator adaptation}}

Just as the [[evolutionary arms race]] has led to the development of pursuit behavior of predators, so too has it led to the anti-predator adaptations of prey. Alarm displays such as eastern swamphen's tail flicking, white-tailed deer's tail flagging, and  Thomson's gazelles' stotting have been observed deterring pursuit.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hasson | first1 = Oren | year = 1991 | title = Pursuit-deterrent Signals: Communication between Prey and Predator | url = | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 6 | issue = 10| pages = 325–29 | doi=10.1016/0169-5347(91)90040-5| pmid = 21232498 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These tactic are believed to signal that a predator's presence is known and, therefore, pursuit will be much more difficult. These displays are more frequent when predators are at an intermediate distance away. Alarm displays are used more often when prey believe predators are more prone to change their decision to pursue. For instance, cheetahs, common predators of Thomson's gazelles, are less likely to change their choice to pursue. As such, gazelles stott less when cheetahs are present than when other predators are present.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In addition to behavioral adaptations, there are also morphological anti-predator adaptations to pursuit predators. For example, many birds have evolved rump feathers that fall off with much less force than the feathers of their other body parts. This allows for easier escape from predator birds, as avian predators often approach prey from their rump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moller | first1 = A. P. | last2 = Nielsen | first2 = J.

=== The confusion effect ===
[[File:Wilderbeest.jpg|thumb|Wildebeest in a herd, showing little differentiation between individuals (low oddity)]]

In many species that fall prey to pursuit predation, gregariousness on a massive scale has evolved as a protective behavior. Such herds can be conspecific (all individuals are of one species) or heterospecific. This is primarily due to the [[Anti-predator adaptation#Predator confusion|confusion effect]], which states that if prey animals congregate in large groups, predators will have more difficulty identifying and tracking specific individuals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Oddity and the 'Confusion Effect' in Predation.|last = Landeau|first = Laurie|date = 1986|journal = Animal Behaviour|doi = 10.1016/s0003-3472(86)80208-1 |last2 = Terborgh|first2 = John |volume=34 |issue = 5|pages=1372–1380}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect has greater influence when individuals are visually similar and less distinguishable. In groups where individuals are visually similar, there is a negative correlation between group size and predator success rates. This may mean that the overall number of attacks decreases with larger group size or that the number of attacks per kill increases with larger group size.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Groups Confuse Predators by Exploiting Perceptual Bottlenecks: a Connectionist Model of the Confusion Effect.|last = Krakauer|first = David C.|date = 1995|journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|doi = 10.1007/bf00177338|pmid = |access-date =|volume=36|issue = 6|pages=421–429}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is especially true in open habitats, such as [[grassland]]s or [[Pelagic zone|open ocean]] ecosystems, where view of the prey group is unobstructed, in contrast to a forest or [[reef]]. Prey species in these open environments tend to be especially gregarious, with notable examples being [[starling]]s and [[sardine]]s. When individuals of the herd are visually dissimilar, however, the success rate of predators increases dramatically.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In one study, [[wildebeest]] on the African Savannah were selected at random and had their horns painted white. This introduced a distinction, or oddity, into the population; researchers found that the wildebeest with white horns were preyed upon at substantially higher rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = The Spotted Hyena. A Study Of Predation and Social Behavior.|last = Kruuk|first = Hans|date = 1973|journal = The Journal of Animal Ecology|doi = 10.2307/3145|pmid = |volume=42|issue = 3|pages=822–824|jstor = 3145}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By standing out, individuals are not as easily lost in the crowd, and so predators are able to track and pursue them with higher fidelity. This has been proposed as the reason why many schooling fish show little to no [[sexual dimorphism]], and why many species in heterospecific schools bear a close resemblance to other species in their school.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Proteins of the '''Betaine/Carnitine/Choline Transporter''' ('''BCCT''') '''family''' are found in [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] and [[Gram-positive bacteria]] and [[archaea]]. The BCCT family is a member a large group of secondary transporters, the [[APC Superfamily|APC superfamily]]. Their common functional feature is that they all transport molecules with a quaternary ammonium group [R-N (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]. The BCCT family proteins vary in length between 481 and 706 amino [[acyl]] residues and possess 12 putative [[Transmembrane segment|transmembrane α-helical spanners]] (TMSs).  The x-ray structures reveal two 5 TMS repeats with the total number of TMSs being 10. These porters catalyze bidirectional [[uniport]] or are energized by [[Proton-motive force|pmf-driven]] or smf-driven proton or sodium ion [[symport]], respectively, or else by substrate:substrate [[antiport]]. Some of these permeases exhibit osmosensory and osmoregulatory properties inherent to their polypeptide chains.&lt;ref name=TCDB&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saier|first1=MH Jr.|title=2.A.15 The Betaine/Carnitine/Choline Transporter (BCCT) Family|url=http://tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.15|website=Transporter Classification Database|publisher=Saier Lab Bioinformatics Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The structures of the sodium-independent carnitine/butyrobetaine antiporter CaiT from ''Proteus mirabilis'' (PmCaiT) ({{PDB2|4M8J}}) and from ''E. coli'' (EcCaiT)({{PDB2|3HFX}}) were determined.&lt;ref name=Schulze&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schulze|first1=S|last2=Köster|first2=S|last3=Geldmacher|first3=U|last4=Terwisscha van Scheltinga|first4=AC|last5=Kühlbrandt|first5=W|title=Structural basis of Na(+)-independent and cooperative substrate/product antiport in CaiT.|journal=Nature|date=September 9, 2010|volume=467|issue=7312|pages=233–6|doi=10.1038/nature09310|pmid=20829798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most members of the BCCT family are Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;- or H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent, whereas EcCaiT is a Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;- and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-independent substrate:product antiporter. The three-dimensional architecture of CaiT resembles that of the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent transporters [http://www.tcdb.org/search/index.php?query=LeuT&amp;type=system LeuT] and [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.15.1.10 BetP], but in CaiT, a methionine sulphur takes the place of the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to coordinate the substrate in the central transport site, accounting for Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; independence. Both CaiT structures ({{PDB2|SWSW}}, {{PDB2|4M8J}}) show the fully open, inward-facing conformation, and thus complete the set of functional states that describe the alternating access mechanism. EcCaiT ({{PDB2|SWSX}}, {{PDB2|3HFX}}) contains two bound butyrobetaine substrate molecules, one in the central transport site, the other in an extracellular binding pocket. In the structure of PmCaiT, a tryptophan side chain occupies the transport site, and access to the extracellular site is blocked. Binding of both substrates to CaiT reconstituted into proteoliposomes is cooperative, with [[Hill coefficient]]s of up to 1.7, indicating that the extracellular site is regulatory. Schulze et al. (2010) proposed a mechanism whereby the occupied regulatory site increases the binding affinity of the transport site and initiates substrate translocation.&lt;ref name=Schulze/&gt; Glycine betaine transporters have been found to contain a conserved region with four tryptophans in their central region.&lt;ref name="PUB00002302"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kempf B, Bremer E, Kappes RM |title=Three transport systems for the osmoprotectant glycine betaine operate in Bacillus subtilis: characterization of OpuD |journal=J. Bacteriol. |volume=178 |issue=17 |pages=5071–5079 |year=1996 |pmid=8752321 |pmc=178300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
Most secondary-active transporters transport their substrates using an [[electrochemical ion gradient]], but the carnitine transporter (CaiT) is an ion-independent, L-carnitine/gamma-butyrobetaine antiporter. Crystal structures of CaiT from ''E. coli'' and ''Proteus mirabilis'' revealed the inverted five-transmembrane-helix repeat similar to that in the amino acid/Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; symporter, LeuT. Kalayil et al. (2013) showed that mutations of arginine 262 (R262) made CaiT Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent with increased transport activity in the presence of a membrane potential, in agreement with substrate/Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cotransport. R262 also plays a role in substrate binding by stabilizing the partly unwound TM1' helix.&lt;ref name=Kalayil&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kalayil|first1=S|last2=Schulze|first2=S|last3=Kühlbrandt|first3=W|title=Arginine oscillation explains Na+ independence in the substrate/product antiporter CaiT.|date=October 22, 2013|volume=110|issue=43|pages=17296–301|doi=10.1073/pnas.1309071110|pmid=24101465|pmc=3808595|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modeling CaiT from ''P. mirabilis'' in the outward-open and closed states on the corresponding structures of the related symporter BetP revealed alternating orientations of the buried R262 side chain, which mimic sodium binding and unbinding in the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-coupled substrate symporters. A similar mechanism may be operative in other Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-independent transporters, in which a positively charged amino acid replaces the cotransported cation. The oscillation of the R262 side chain in CaiT indicates how a positive charge triggers the change between outward-open and inward-open conformations.&lt;ref name=Kalayil /&gt;

==Transport reactions==
The generalized transport reactions catalyzed by members of the BCCT family are:&lt;ref name=TCDB /&gt;

::Substrate (out) + nH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) → Substrate (in) + nH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in)

::Substrate (out) + Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) → Substrate (in) + Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in)

::Substrate-1 (out) + Substrate-2 (in) → Substrate-1 (in) + Substrate-2 (out)

::Substrate (out) ⇌ Substrate (in)

:::Substrate = a quaternary amine

==Other betaine transporters==

==Members of APC Family==

Members of one subfamily within the APC family ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.3.9#2.A.3.9 SGP; TC# 2.A.3.9]) are amino acid receptors rather than transporters &lt;ref name=Cabrera&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cabrera-Martinez RM, Tovar-Rojo F, Vepachedu VR, Setlow P | title = Effects of overexpression of nutrient receptors on germination of spores of Bacillus subtilis | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 185 | issue = 8 | pages = 2457–64 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12670969 | pmc = 152624 | doi = 10.1128/jb.185.8.2457-2464.2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are truncated at their C-termini, relative to the transporters, having 10 TMSs.&lt;ref name=Jack&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jack DL, Paulsen IT, Saier MH | title = The amino acid/polyamine/organocation (APC) superfamily of transporters specific for amino acids, polyamines and organocations | journal = Microbiology | volume = 146 ( Pt 8) | issue = 8 | pages = 1797–814 | date = August 2000 | pmid = 10931886 | doi = 10.1099/00221287-146-8-1797 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eukaryotic members of another subfamily ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.3.3#2.A.3.3 CAT; TC# 2.A.3.3]) and the members of a prokaryotic subfamily ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.3.11#2.A.3.11 AGT; TC #2.A.3.11]) have 14 TMSs.&lt;ref name=Lorca&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lorca G, Winnen B, Saier MH | title = Identification of the L-aspartate transporter in Bacillus subtilis | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 185 | issue = 10 | pages = 3218–22 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12730183 | pmc = 154055 | doi = 10.1128/jb.185.10.3218-3222.2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The larger eukaryotic and archaeal proteins possess N- and C-terminal hydrophilic extensions. Some animal proteins, for example, those in the LAT subfamily ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.3.8#2.A.3.8 TC# 2.A.3.8]) including [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.3.8.2 ASUR4 (gbY12716)] and [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.3.8.3 SPRM1 (gbL25068)] associate with a type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein that is essential for insertion or activity of the permease and forms a disulfide bridge with it. These glycoproteins include the CD98 heavy chain protein of ''Mus musculus (gbU25708)'' and the orthologous 4F2 cell surface antigen heavy chain of ''Homo sapiens (spP08195).'' The latter protein is required for the activity of the cystine/glutamate antiporter ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.3.8.5 2.A.3.8.5]), which maintains cellular redox balance and cysteine/glutathione levels.&lt;ref name="Sato 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sato H, Shiiya A, Kimata M, Maebara K, Tamba M, Sakakura Y, Makino N, Sugiyama F, Yagami K, Moriguchi T, Takahashi S, Bannai S | title = Redox imbalance in cystine/glutamate transporter-deficient mice | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 280 | issue = 45 | pages = 37423–9 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16144837 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.m506439200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are members of the rBAT family of mammalian proteins ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=8.A.9 TC #8.A.9]).

Two APC family members, LAT1 and LAT2 ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.3.8.7 TC #2.A.3.8.7]), transport a neurotoxicant, the methylmercury-L-cysteine complex, by [[molecular mimicry]].&lt;ref name=SimWillis&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Simmons-Willis TA, Koh AS, Clarkson TW, Ballatori N | title = Transport of a neurotoxicant by molecular mimicry: the methylmercury-L-cysteine complex is a substrate for human L-type large neutral amino acid transporter (LAT) 1 and LAT2 | journal = The Biochemical Journal | volume = 367 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 239–46 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12117417 | pmc = 1222880 | doi = 10.1042/bj20020841 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and Function==
Based on 3-D structures of APC superfamily members, Rudnick (2011) has proposed the pathway for transport and suggested a "''rocking bundle"'' mechanism.&lt;ref name="TCDB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Forrest"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Forrest LR, Rudnick G | title = The rocking bundle: a mechanism for ion-coupled solute flux by symmetrical transporters | journal = Physiology | volume = 24 | issue = 6 | pages = 377–86 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19996368 | pmc = 3012352 | doi = 10.1152/physiol.00030.2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rudnick 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rudnick G | title = Cytoplasmic permeation pathway of neurotransmitter transporters | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 50 | issue = 35 | pages = 7462–75 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21774491 | pmc = 3164596 | doi = 10.1021/bi200926b }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transport Reactions===
Transport reactions generally catalyzed by APC Superfamily members include:&lt;ref name=TCDB/&gt;

::Solute:proton symport 
 Solute (out) + nH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) → Solute (in) + nH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  (in).

::Solute:solute antiport
 Solute-1 (out) + Solute-2 (in) ⇌ Solute-1 (in) + Solute-2 (out).

[[Seagrass]] bed sediment (soil) is typically anoxic, containing a reduced form of sulfur: [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S).  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is a phytotoxin that results from [[anaerobic digestion]], the [[decomposition]] of [[organic matter]] in the absence of oxygen.  However, seagrass can persist in this environment because of physiological adaptations, as well as functional adaptations of other organisms in the ecosystem.  For example, bivalves (clams) in the family [[Lucinidae]] host symbiotic bacteria that oxidize sulfides.  Lucinid bivalves' gills house the bacteria, and the siphon supplies the bacteria and surrounding [[pore water]] with oxygenated water from above the sediment.  Bacterial oxidation of the sulfides results in sulfates, reducing toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Lucinid clam influence on the biogeochemistry of the seagrass Thalassia testudinum sediments | author=L.K.

The '''4-Toluene Sulfonate Uptake Permease (TSUP) family''' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.102 TC# 2.A.102]) is also referred to as the TauE/SafE/YfcA/DUF81 Family.  Although its members have not been rigorously characterized, evidence is available that at least some members function in the transport of sulfur containing organic compounds.  These include 4-toluene sulfonate which may be transported by the TsaS of ''Cupriavidus necator'' (TC# 2.A.102.1.1), sulfolactate which may be exported by the TauE protein of ''Cupriavidus necator'' (TC# 2.A.102.2.1) &lt;ref name=Weinitschke&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weinitschke|first1=S|last2=Denger|first2=K|last3=Cook|first3=AM|last4=Smits|first4=TH|title=The DUF81 protein TauE in Cupriavidus necator H16, a sulfite exporter in the metabolism of C2 sulfonates.|journal=Microbiology|date=September 2007|volume=153|issue=9|pages=3055–60|pmid=17768248|doi=10.1099/mic.0.2007/009845-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayer|first1=J|last2=Denger|first2=K|last3=Hollemeyer|first3=K|last4=Schleheck|first4=D|last5=Cook|first5=AM|title=(R)-Cysteate-nitrogen assimilation by Cupriavidus necator H16 with excretion of 3-sulfolactate: a patchwork pathway.|journal=Archives of Microbiology|date=November 2012|volume=194|issue=11|pages=949–57|doi=10.1007/s00203-012-0825-y|pmid=22797525|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1239682|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sulfoacetate which may be exported by the SafE1 protein of ''Neptuniibacter caesariensis'' (TC# 2.A.102.2.2).&lt;ref name="Krejcík"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krejcík|first1=Z|last2=Denger|first2=K|last3=Weinitschke|first3=S|last4=Hollemeyer|first4=K|last5=Paces|first5=V|last6=Cook|first6=AM|last7=Smits|first7=TH|title=Sulfoacetate released during the assimilation of taurine-nitrogen by Neptuniibacter caesariensis: purification of sulfoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase.|journal=Archives of Microbiology|date=August 2008|volume=190|issue=2|pages=159–68|doi=10.1007/s00203-008-0386-2|pmid=18506422|url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:352-opus-67590|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another member of the TSUP family, TsaS of ''Comamonas testosteroni'', has been reported to function in the uptake of 4-toluene sulfonate.&lt;ref name=Mampel&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mampel|first1=J|last2=Maier|first2=E|last3=Tralau|first3=T|last4=Ruff|first4=J|last5=Benz|first5=R|last6=Cook|first6=AM|title=A novel outer-membrane anion channel (porin) as part of a putatively two-component transport system for 4-toluenesulphonate in Comamonas testosteroni T-2.|journal=Biochemical Journal|date=October 1, 2004|volume=383|issue=1|pages=91–9|pmid=15176949|doi=10.1042/bj20040652|pmc=1134047}}&lt;/ref&gt;  None of these functional assignments can be considered to be certain.&lt;ref name=TCDB&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saier|first1=MH Jr.|title=2.A.102.

Members of the '''Alanine or Glycine:Cation Symporter (AGCS) Family''' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.25 TC# 2.A.25]) transport [[alanine]] and/or [[glycine]] in [[symport]] with Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and or H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Structure and function==
Known proteins in the AGCS family are between 445 and 550 amino acyl residues in length and possess 8 to 12 putative transmembrane α-helical spanners. Members may possess 11 transmembrane segments (TMSs), as seems to be true for DagA ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.25.1.1 TC# 2.A.25.1.1]) and AgcS ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.25.1.3 TC# 2.A.25.1.3]), although Acp ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.25.1.2 TC# 2.A.25.1.2]) has only 8 TMSs, perhaps the result of truncation. As of early 2016, there does not appear to be any 3D crystal structure data available for these proteins. Members of the AGCS family have been found in bacteria and archaea, such as extremophile halotolerant cyanobacterium ''Aphanothece halophytica,'' and thermophilic bacteria, ''Bacillus'' ''PS3''.&lt;ref name="Bualuang"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bualuang A, Kageyama H, Tanaka Y, Incharoensakdi A, Takabe T | title = Functional characterization of a member of alanine or glycine: cation symporter family in halotolerant cyanobacterium Aphanothece halophytica | journal = Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry | volume = 79 | issue = 2 | pages = 230–5 | date = 2015 | pmid = 25421789 | doi = 10.1080/09168451.2014.968091 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kanamori M, Kamata H, Yagisawa H, Hirata H | title = Overexpression of the alanine carrier protein gene from thermophilic bacterium PS3 in Escherichia coli | journal = Journal of Biochemistry | volume = 125 | issue = 3 | pages = 454–9 | date = March 1999 | pmid = 10050032 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a022308 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, only three members of the family have been functionally characterized. These proteins show limited sequence similarity in the APC family ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.3 TC# 2.A.3]).&lt;ref name=TCDB/&gt; As of early 2016, there do not appear to be any crystal structures available for members of the AGCS family.

===Transport reaction===
The generalized transport reaction catalyzed by the AGCS family is:&lt;ref name=TCDB&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saier|first1=MH | name-list-format = vanc |title=2.A.25 The Alanine or Glycine:Cation Symporter (AGCS) Family|url=http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.25|website=Transporter Classification Database|publisher=Saier Lab Bioinformatics Group / SDSC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

alanine or glycine (out) + Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) → alanine or glycine (in) + Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in).

==Proteins in the AGCS family==
There are currently 10 proteins belonging to the AGCS family. These proteins and their descriptions can be found in the [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.25.2 Transporter Classification Database].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3573">The '''Hydroxy/Aromatic Amino Acid Permease (HAAAP) Family''' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.42 TC# 2.A.42]) is a member of the large [[APC Superfamily|Amino Acid-Polyamine-OrganoCation (APC) Superfamily]] of secondary carriers. Members of the HAAAP family all function in amino acid uptake. Homologues are present in a large number of [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] and [[Gram-positive bacteria]], with at least one member classified from archaea ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.42.1.7 TC# 2.A.42.1.7], ''[[Thermococcus barophilus]]'')''.''

==Structure==
Proteins of the HAAAP family possess 403-443 amino acyl residues and exhibit eleven putative or established transmembrane α-helical spanners (TMSs).  These proteins exhibit topological features common to the eukaryotic [[AAAP Family|amino acid/auxin permease (AAAP) family]] ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.18 TC# 2.A.18]). These proteins also exhibit limited sequence similarity with some of the AAAP family members. A phylogenetic relationship has been proposed between members of the HAAAP family and APC family since they exhibit limited sequence similarity with one another.

As of early 2016, there is no crystal structural data available for members of the HAAAP family in [[Protein Data Bank|RCSB]].

==Members of the HAAAP Family==
The HAAAP family includes three well-characterized aromatic amino acid:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; symport permeases of ''E. coli'': a high affinity tryptophan-specific permease, Mtr ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.42.1.2 TC# 2.A.42.1.2]), a low affinity tryptophan permease, TnaB ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.42.1.3 TC# 2.A.42.1.3]), and a tyrosine-specific permease, TyrP ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.42.1.1 TC# 2.A.42.1.1]), as well as two well-characterized hydroxy amino acid permeases, the serine permease, SdaC ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.42.2.1 TC# 2.A.42.2.1]), of ''E. coli'', and the threonine permease, TdcC ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.42.2.2 TC# 2.A.42.2.2]), of ''E. coli''.  

SdaC of ''E. coli'' (TC# 2.A.42.2.1) is also called DcrA, and together with a periplasmic protein DcrB (P37620), has been reported to play a role in phage DNA uptake in conjunction with an outer membrane receptor of the OMR family ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.B.14 TC# 1.B.14]). Thus, FhuA (TC #1.B.14.1.4) transports phage T5 DNA while BtuB ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.B.14.3.1 TC# 1.B.14.3.1]) transports phage C1 DNA (Samsonov et al., 2002). DcuB is a putative lipoprotein found only in enteric bacteria. 

All members of the HAAAP family can be found in the [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.42.2 Transporter Classification Database].

==Transport Reaction==
The generalized transport reaction catalyzed by proteins of the HAAAP family is:

Amino acid (out) + nH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) → Amino acid (in) + nH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in).

}} 
The '''Nucleobase:Cation Symporter-1 (NCS1) Family''' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.39 TC# 2.A.39]) consists of over 1000 currently sequenced proteins derived from [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] and [[Gram-positive bacteria|Gram-positive]] bacteria, [[archaea]], fungi and plants. These proteins function as transporters for nucleobases including [[purines]] and [[pyrimidines]]. Members of this family possess twelve transmembrane α-helical spanners (TMSs). At least some of them have been shown to function in uptake by substrate:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; symport mechanism.

==Phylogeny==
The bacterial and yeast proteins are widely divergent and do not cluster closely on the NCS1 family phylogenetic tree. ''B. subtilis'' possesses two paralogues of the NCS1 family, and ''S. cerevisiae'' has several. Two of the yeast proteins (Dal4 ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.39.3.1 TC# 2.A.39.3.1]) and Fur4 ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.39.3.2 TC# 2.A.39.3.2])) cluster tightly together. Three other ''S. cerevisiae'' proteins, one of which is the thiamin permease, Thi10 ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.39.4.1 TC# 2.A.39.4.1]), and another of which is the nicotinamide riboside transporter, Nrt1 ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.39.4.2 TC# 2.A.39.4.2]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Belenky PA, Moga TG, Brenner C | title = Saccharomyces cerevisiae YOR071C encodes the high affinity nicotinamide riboside transporter Nrt1 | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 283 | issue = 13 | pages = 8075–9 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18258590 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.C800021200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also cluster tightly together. The latter three proteins are likely to be closely related thiamin permease isoforms. The yeast cytosine-purine and vitamin B6 transporters cluster loosely together (24% identity; e-50).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stolz J, Vielreicher M | title = Tpn1p, the plasma membrane vitamin B6 transporter of Saccharomyces cerevisiae | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 278 | issue = 21 | pages = 18990–6 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12649274 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M300949200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bacterial proteins are derived from several Gram-negative and Gram-positive species. These proteins exhibit limited sequence similarity with the xanthine permease, PbuX ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.39.4.1 TC# 2.A.39.4.1]), of ''Bacillus subtilis'' which is a member of the [[Nucleobase cation symporter-2|NCS2 family]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.39#ref34543773|title = 2.A.39 The Nucleobase:Cation Symporter-1 (NCS1) Family|date = |access-date = |website = Transporter Classification Database|publisher = Saier Lab Bioinformatics Group / SDSC|last = Saier|first = MH Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and Function==
Proteins of the NCS1 family are 419-635 amino acyl residues long and possess twelve putative transmembrane α-helical spanners (TMSs). At least some of them have been shown to function in uptake by substrate:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; symport. In these respects, and with respect to substrate specificity, these proteins resemble the symporters of the [[Nucleobase cation symporter-2|NCS2 family]], providing further evidence that the two families represent distant constituents of a single superfamily, the [[APC Superfamily]]. The two families probably arose by an early gene duplication event that occurred long before divergence of the three major kingdoms of life. It is possible that they are distant constituents of the MFS (2.A.1).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The nucleobase-cation-symport-1 (NCS1) transporters are essential components of salvage pathways for [[nucleobase]]s and related metabolites. Weyand et al. (2008) reported the 2.85-angstrom resolution structure of the NCS1 benzyl-hydantoin transporter, Mhp1 ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.39.3.6 TC# 2.A.39.3.6]), from ''Microbacterium liquefaciens''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weyand S, Shimamura T, Yajima S, Suzuki S, Mirza O, Krusong K, Carpenter EP, Rutherford NG, Hadden JM, O'Reilly J, Ma P, Saidijam M, Patching SG, Hope RJ, Norbertczak HT, Roach PC, Iwata S, Henderson PJ, Cameron AD | title = Structure and molecular mechanism of a nucleobase-cation-symport-1 family transporter | journal = Science | volume = 322 | issue = 5902 | pages = 709–13 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18927357 | pmc = 2885439 | doi = 10.1126/science.1164440 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This structure (and related structures) are available through [https://web.archive.org/web/20150418160606/http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do RCSB] ({{PDB|2JLN}}, {{PDB2|2X79}}, {{PDB2|4D1A}}, {{PDB2|4D1B}}, {{PDB2|4D1C}}, {{PDB2|4D1D}}). Mhp1 contains 12 transmembrane helices, 10 of which are arranged in two inverted repeats of five helices. The structures of the outward-facing open and substrate-bound occluded conformations were solved, showing how the outward-facing cavity closes upon binding of substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kazmier K, Sharma S, Islam SM, Roux B, Mchaourab HS | title = Conformational cycle and ion-coupling mechanism of the Na+/hydantoin transporter Mhp1 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 41 | pages = 14752–7 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25267652 | pmc = 4205665 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1410431111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparisons with the leucine transporter LeuT(Aa) and the galactose transporter vSGLT reveal that the outward- and inward-facing cavities are symmetrically arranged on opposite sides of the membrane. The reciprocal opening and closing of these cavities is synchronized by the inverted repeat helices 3 and 8, providing the structural basis of the alternating access model for membrane transport.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Substrates===
NCS1 proteins are H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; symporters specific for the uptake of purines, pyrimidines and related metabolites. Krypotou et al. 2015 studied the origin, diversification and substrate specificities of fungal NCS1 transporters, suggesting that the two fungal NCS1 subfamilies, Fur and Fcy, and plant homologues, originated through independent horizontal transfers from prokaryotes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krypotou E, Evangelidis T, Bobonis J, Pittis AA, Gabaldón T, Scazzocchio C, Mikros E, Diallinas G | title = Origin, diversification and substrate specificity in the family of NCS1/FUR transporters | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 96 | issue = 5 | pages = 927–50 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25712422 | doi = 10.1111/mmi.12982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Expansion by gene duplication led to functional diversification of fungal NCS1 porters. They characterized all Fur proteins in Aspergillus nidulans. Homology modelling, substrate docking, molecular dynamics and systematic mutational analysis in three Fur transporters with distinct specificities identified residues critical for function and specificity, located within a major substrate binding site, in transmembrane segments TMS1, TMS3, TMS6 and TMS8. They predicted and confirmed that residues determining substrate specificity are located not only in the major substrate binding site, but also in a putative outward-facing selectivity gate. Their evolutionary and structure-function analyses led to the concept that selective channel-like gates may contribute to substrate specificity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Transport Reaction==
The generalized transport reaction catalyzed by NCS1 family permeases is:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

:Nucleobase or Vitamin (out) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) → Nucleobase or Vitamin (in) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in)

They are integral membrane proteins with seven transmembrane helices, the last of which contains the attachment point for [[retinal]] (a conserved lysine).

This protein family includes light-driven [[proton pumps]], [[ion pumps]] and [[ion channels]], as well as light sensors. For example, the proteins from [[halobacteria]] include [[bacteriorhodopsin]] and [[archaerhodopsin]], which are light-driven [[proton pump]]s; [[halorhodopsin]], a light-driven chloride pump; and sensory rhodopsin, which mediates both [[Phototropism|photoattractant]] (in the red) and [[photophobic]] (in the ultra-violet) responses. Proteins from other bacteria include [[proteorhodopsin]].

Contrary to their name, microbial rhodopsins are found not only in [[Archaea]] and [[Bacteria]], but also in [[Eukaryota]] (such as [[algae]]) and [[viruses]]; although they are rare in complex [[multicellular organism]]s.&lt;ref name="BoeufAudic2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boeuf|first1=Dominique|last2=Audic|first2=Stéphane|last3=Brillet-Guéguen|first3=Loraine|last4=Caron|first4=Christophe|last5=Jeanthon|first5=Christian|title=MicRhoDE: a curated database for the analysis of microbial rhodopsin diversity and evolution|journal=Database|volume=2015|year=2015|pages=bav080|url=http://database.oxfordjournals.org/content/2015/bav080.full|issn=1758-0463|doi=10.1093/database/bav080|pmid=26286928|pmc=4539915}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YawoKandori2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yawo|first1=Hiromu|last2=Kandori|first2=Hideki|last3=Koizumi|first3=Amane|title=Optogenetics: Light-Sensing Proteins and Their Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5M3WCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3|accessdate=30 September 2015|date=5 June 2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-4-431-55516-2|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nomenclature ==
'''Rhodopsin''' was originally a synonym for "[[Rhodopsin|visual purple]]", a visual [[Biological pigment|pigment]] (light-sensitive molecule) found in the [[retina]]s of frogs and other [[vertebrate]]s, used for [[Scotopic vision|dim-light vision]], and usually found in [[rod cells]]. This is still the meaning of rhodopsin in the narrow sense, any protein evolutionarily [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to this protein. In a broad non-genetic sense, rhodopsin refers to any molecule, whether related by genetic descent or not (mostly not), consisting of an opsin and a chromophore (generally a variant of retinal). All animal rhodopsins arose (by gene duplication and divergence) late in the history of the large GPCR [G-Protein Coupled Receptor] gene family, which itself arose after the divergence of plants, fungi, choanflagellates and sponges from the earliest animals. The retinal chromophore is found solely in the opsin branch of this large gene family, meaning its occurrence elsewhere represents convergent evolution, not homology.

The term '''bacterial rhodopsin''' originally referred to the first microbial rhodopsin discovered, known today as [[bacteriorhodopsin]]. The first bacteriorhodopsin turned out to be of archaeal origin, from ''[[Halobacterium salinarum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grote|first=Mathias|last2=O'Malley|first2=Maureen A.|date=2011-11-01|title=Enlightening the life sciences: the history of halobacterial and microbial rhodopsin research|journal=FEMS Microbiology Reviews|volume=35|issue=6|pages=1082–1099|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2011.00281.x|issn=1574-6976|pmid=21623844}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, other microbial rhodopsins have been discovered, rendering the term ''bacterial rhodopsin'' ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |date=19 December 2012 |title =rhodopsin, n. |encyclopedia=OED Online |publisher=Oxford University Press |location= |id=|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/165304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PhD2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mason|first=Peggy|title=Medical Neurobiology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IcRqgPnstUUC&amp;pg=PA375|accessdate=21 September 2015|date=26 May 2011|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=978-0-19-533997-0|page=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Ion-Translocating Microbial Rhodopsin Family==
The '''Ion-translocating Microbial Rhodopsin (MR) Family''' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=3.E.1 TC# 3.E.1]) is a member of the [[TOG Superfamily]] of secondary carriers. Members of the MR family [[Catalysis|catalyze]] light-driven ion translocation across microbial cytoplasmic membranes or serve as light receptors. Most proteins of the MR family are all of about the same size (250-350 amino acyl residues) and possess seven [[Transmembrane domain|transmembrane]] helical spanners with their [[N-terminus|N-termini]] on the outside and their [[C-terminus|C-termini]] on the inside. There are 9 subfamilies in the MR family:&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=3.E.1#ref9955|title = 3.E.1 The Ion-translocating Microbial Rhodopsin (MR) Family|date = |access-date = |website = Transporter Classification Database|publisher = Saier Lab Bioinformatics Group / SDSC|last = Saier|first = MH Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Function===
The association of sensory rhodopsins with their transducer proteins appears to determine whether they function as transporters or receptors. Association of a sensory rhodopsin receptor with its transducer occurs via the transmembrane helical domains of the two interacting proteins. There are two sensory rhodopsins in any one halophilic archaeon, one (SRI) that responds positively to orange light but negatively to blue light, the other (SRII) that responds only negatively to blue light. Each transducer is specific for its cognate receptor. An x-ray structure of SRII complexed with its transducer (HtrII) at 1.94 Å resolution is available ({{PDB2|1H2S}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Molecular basis of transmembrane signalling by sensory rhodopsin II-transducer complex|journal = Nature|date = 2002-10-03|issn = 0028-0836|pmid = 12368857|pages = 484–487|volume = 419|issue = 6906|doi = 10.1038/nature01109|first = Valentin I.|last = Gordeliy|first2 = Jörg|last2 = Labahn|first3 = Rouslan|last3 = Moukhametzianov|first4 = Rouslan|last4 = Efremov|first5 = Joachim|last5 = Granzin|first6 = Ramona|last6 = Schlesinger|first7 = Georg|last7 = Büldt|first8 = Tudor|last8 = Savopol|first9 = Axel J.|last9 = Scheidig}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Molecular and evolutionary aspects of the light-signal transduction by microbial sensory receptors have been reviewed.&lt;ref name="Inoue 562–577"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Molecular and evolutionary aspects of microbial sensory rhodopsins|journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta|date = 2014-05-01|issn = 0006-3002|pmid = 23732219|pages = 562–577|volume = 1837|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.bbabio.2013.05.005|first = Keiichi|last = Inoue|first2 = Takashi|last2 = Tsukamoto|first3 = Yuki|last3 = Sudo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacterio- and halorhodopsins pump 1 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and 1 Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; per photon absorbed, respectively. Specific transport mechanisms and pathways have been proposed.&lt;ref name="Kolbe 1390–1396"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mechanism of proton transport in bacteriorhodopsin from crystallographic structures of the K, L, M1, M2, and M2' intermediates of the photocycle|journal = Journal of Molecular Biology|date = 2003-04-25|issn = 0022-2836|pmid = 12691752|pages = 439–450|volume = 328|issue = 2|first = Janos K.|last = Lanyi|first2 = Brigitte|last2 = Schobert|doi=10.1016/s0022-2836(03)00263-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Crystallographic structures of the M and N intermediates of bacteriorhodopsin: assembly of a hydrogen-bonded chain of water molecules between Asp-96 and the retinal Schiff base|journal = Journal of Molecular Biology|date = 2003-07-11|issn = 0022-2836|pmid = 12842471|pages = 553–570|volume = 330|issue = 3|first = Brigitte|last = Schobert|first2 = Leonid S.|last2 = Brown|first3 = Janos K.|last3 = Lanyi|doi=10.1016/s0022-2836(03)00576-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism involves:

(1) photo-isomerization of the retinal and its initial configurational changes,

(2) deprotonation of the retinal Schiff base and the coupled release of a proton to the extracellular membrane surface,

(3) the switch event that allows reprotonation of the Schiff base from the cytoplasmic side.

Six structural models describe the transformations of the retinal and its interaction with water 402, Asp85, and Asp212 in atomic detail, as well as the displacements of functional residues farther from the [[Schiff base]]. The changes provide rationales for how relaxation of the distorted retinal causes movements of water and protein atoms that result in vectorial proton transfers to and from the Schiff base.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Helix deformation is coupled to vectorial proton transport in the photocycle of bacteriorhodopsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Helix deformation is coupled to vectorial proton transport in the photocycle of bacteriorhodopsin|journal = Nature|date = 2000-08-10|issn = 0028-0836|pmid = 10949307|pages = 645–648|volume = 406|issue = 6796|doi = 10.1038/35020599|first = A.|last = Royant|first2 = K.|last2 = Edman|first3 = T.|last3 = Ursby|first4 = E.|last4 = Pebay-Peyroula|first5 = E. M.|last5 = Landau|first6 = R.|last6 = Neutze}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most residues participating in the trimerization are not conserved in bacteriorhodopsin, a homologous protein capable of forming a trimeric structure in the absence of bacterioruberin. Despite a large alteration in the amino acid sequence, the shape of the intratrimer hydrophobic space filled by lipids is highly conserved between archaerhodopsin-2 and bacteriorhodopsin. Since a transmembrane helix facing this space undergoes a large conformational change during the proton pumping cycle, it is feasible that trimerization is an important strategy to capture special lipid components that are relevant to the protein activity.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Structural role of bacterioruberin in the trimeric structure of archaerhodopsin-2|journal = Journal of Molecular Biology|date = 2008-02-01|issn = 1089-8638|pmid = 18082767|pages = 1267–1281|volume = 375|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.jmb.2007.11.039|first = Keiko|last = Yoshimura|first2 = Tsutomu|last2 = Kouyama}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marine Bacterial Rhodopsin===

A marine bacterial rhodopsin has been reported to function as a proton pump. However, it also resembles sensory rhodopsin II of archaea as well as an Orf from the fungus ''Leptosphaeria maculans'' (AF290180). These proteins exhibit 20-30% identity with each other.

===Channelrhodopsins===

[[Channelrhodopsin]]-1 (ChR1) or channelopsin-1 (Chop1; Cop3; CSOA) of ''C. reinhardtii'' is closely related to the archaeal sensory rhodopsins. It has 712 aas with a signal peptide, followed by a short amphipathic region, and then a hydrophobic N-terminal domain with seven probable TMSs (residues 76-309) followed by a long hydrophilic C-terminal domain of about 400 residues. Part of the C-terminal hydrophilic domain is homologous to intersectin (EH and SH3 domain protein 1A) of animals (AAD30271).

Chop1 serves as a light-gated proton channel and mediates phototaxis and photophobic responses in green algae.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Based on this phenotype, Chop1 could be assigned to [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A TC category #1.A], but because it belongs to a family in which well-characterized homologues catalyze active ion transport, it is assigned to the MR family. Expression of the ''chop1'' gene, or a truncated form of that gene encoding only the hydrophobic core (residues 1-346 or 1-517) in frog oocytes in the presence of all-trans retinal produces a light-gated conductance that shows characteristics of a channel passively but selectively permeable to protons. This channel activity probably generates bioelectric currents.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A homologue of ChR1 in ''C. reinhardtii'' is channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2; Chop2; Cop4; CSOB). This protein is 57% identical, 10% similar to ChR1. It forms a cation-selective ion channel activated by light absorption. It transports both monovalent and divalent cations. It desensitizes to a small conductance in continuous light. Recovery from desensitization is accelerated by extracellular H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and a negative membrane potential. It may be a photoreceptor for dark adapted cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Channelrhodopsin-2, a directly light-gated cation-selective membrane channel|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date = 2003-11-25|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 283525|pmid = 14615590|pages = 13940–13945|volume = 100|issue = 24|doi = 10.1073/pnas.1936192100|first = Georg|last = Nagel|first2 = Tanjef|last2 = Szellas|first3 = Wolfram|last3 = Huhn|first4 = Suneel|last4 = Kateriya|first5 = Nona|last5 = Adeishvili|first6 = Peter|last6 = Berthold|first7 = Doris|last7 = Ollig|first8 = Peter|last8 = Hegemann|first9 = Ernst|last9 = Bamberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; A transient increase in hydration of transmembrane α-helices with a t(1/2) = 60 μs tallies with the onset of cation permeation. Aspartate 253 accepts the proton released by the Schiff base (t(1/2) = 10 μs), with the latter being reprotonated by aspartic acid 156 (t(1/2) = 2 ms). The internal proton acceptor and donor groups, corresponding to D212 and D115 in bacteriorhodopsin, are clearly different from other microbial rhodopsins, indicating that their spatial positions in the protein were relocated during evolution. E90 deprotonates exclusively in the nonconductive state. The observed proton transfer reactions and the protein conformational changes relate to the gating of the cation channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Transient protonation changes in channelrhodopsin-2 and their relevance to channel gating|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date = 2013-04-02|issn = 1091-6490|pmc = 3619329|pmid = 23509282|pages = E1273–1281|volume = 110|issue = 14|doi = 10.1073/pnas.1219502110|first = Víctor A.|last = Lórenz-Fonfría|first2 = Tom|last2 = Resler|first3 = Nils|last3 = Krause|first4 = Melanie|last4 = Nack|first5 = Michael|last5 = Gossing|first6 = Gabriele|last6 = Fischer von Mollard|first7 = Christian|last7 = Bamann|first8 = Ernst|last8 = Bamberg|first9 = Ramona|last9 = Schlesinger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaerhodopsin===

Archaerhodopsin-2 (aR2) was found in the claret membrane of ''Halorubrum sp''. It is a light-driven proton pump. Trigonal and hexagonal crystals revealed that trimers are arranged on a honeycomb lattice.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In these crystals, the carotenoid bacterioruberin binds to crevices between the subunits of the trimer. Its polyene chain is inclined from the membrane normal by an angle of about 20 degrees and, on the cytoplasmic side, it is surrounded by helices AB and DE of neighboring subunits. This peculiar binding mode suggests that bacterioruberin plays a structural role for the trimerization of aR2. When compared with the aR2 structure in another crystal form containing no bacterioruberin, the proton release channel takes a more closed conformation in the P321 or P6(3) crystal; i.e., the native conformation of protein is stabilized in the trimeric protein-bacterioruberin complex.

==Transport Reaction==
The generalized transport reaction for bacterio- and sensory rhodopsins is:&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in) + hν → H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out).

That for halorhodopsin is:

:Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (out) + hν → Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (in).

The '''Nicotinamide Ribonucleoside (NR) Uptake Permease (PnuC) Family''' ([http://tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=4.B.1 TC# 4.B.1]) is a family of transmembrane transporters that is part of the [[TOG superfamily]].&lt;ref name="Yee_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yee DC, Shlykov MA, Västermark A, Reddy VS, Arora S, Sun EI, Saier MH | title = The transporter-opsin-G protein-coupled receptor (TOG) superfamily | journal = The FEBS Journal | volume = 280 | issue = 22 | pages = 5780–800 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 23981446 | pmc = 3832197 | doi = 10.1111/febs.12499 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Close PnuC homologues are found in a wide range of [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] and [[Gram-positive bacteria]], [[archaea]] and [[eukaryote]]s.&lt;ref name="TCB"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=4.B.1#ref3139|title = 4.B.1 The Nicotinamide Ribonucleoside (NR) Uptake Permease (PnuC) Family|date = |access-date = |website = Transporter Classification Database|publisher = Saier Lab Bioinformatics Group / SDSC|last = Saier|first = MH Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
PnuC of ''[[Salmonella typhimurium]]'' and ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' are believed to function cooperatively with NadR homologues, multifunctional proteins that together with PnuC, participate in NR [[phosphorylation]], transport and [[transcriptional regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Foster JW, Park YK, Penfound T, Fenger T, Spector MP | title = Regulation of NAD metabolism in Salmonella typhimurium: molecular sequence analysis of the bifunctional nadR regulator and the nadA-pnuC operon | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 172 | issue = 8 | pages = 4187–96 | date = August 1990 | pmid = 2198247 | pmc = 213241 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merdanovic_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Merdanovic M, Sauer E, Reidl J | title = Coupling of NAD+ biosynthesis and nicotinamide ribosyl transport: characterization of NadR ribonucleotide kinase mutants of Haemophilus influenzae | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 187 | issue = 13 | pages = 4410–20 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 15968050 | pmc = 1151767 | doi = 10.1128/JB.187.13.4410-4420.2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Penfound T, Foster JW | title = NAD-dependent DNA-binding activity of the bifunctional NadR regulator of Salmonella typhimurium | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 181 | issue = 2 | pages = 648–55 | date = January 1999 | pmid = 9882682 | pmc = 93422 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NadR, a cytoplasmic protein that is partly membrane associated, contains one well conserved and one poorly conserved mononucleotide-binding [[consensus sequence]] (G-X4 GKS). It drives transport and may render transport responsive to internal pyridine nucleotide levels. While its N-terminal half functions as a repressor, its C-terminal half functions as an NR kinase in a putative group translocation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mitchell P, Moyle J | title = Group-translocation: a consequence of enzyme-catalysed group-transfer | journal = Nature | volume = 182 | issue = 4632 | pages = 372–3 | date = August 1958 | pmid = 13577842 | doi = 10.1038/182372a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PnuC of ''Haemophilus influenzae''===
The ''H. influenzae'' homologue has been shown to transport NR from the periplasm into the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation of NR by NadR is required for NR uptake. The ribonucleoside [[kinase]] (RNK) domain has both [[Walker A motif|Walker A]] and [[Walker motifs|Walker B motifs]], responsible for ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer. In addition, a proposed LID domain was identified in RNK. LID domains have been found in other kinases, and these domains are regions which are able to move after substrate binding. They are responsible for coordination of three distinct conformations, an open state in the absence of substrate, a partially closed state after substrate binding, and a fully closed state when both substrates are present.

In ''H. influenzae'', NR enters the [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] resynthesis pathway after [[phosphorylation]] to NMN, and subsequently, NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is synthesized from NMN and ATP via an NMN adenylyl transferase activity.&lt;ref name="Kurnasov 6906–6917"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cynamon MH, Sorg TB, Patapow A | title = Utilization and metabolism of NAD by Haemophilus parainfluenzae | journal = Journal of General Microbiology | volume = 134 | issue = 10 | pages = 2789–99 | date = October 1988 | pmid = 3254936 | doi = 10.1099/00221287-134-10-2789 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NadR represents a multifunctional regulator/enzyme complex able to integrate several functions, such as enzymatic catalysis, transport, and transcriptional regulatory activities.

==Other constituents required for uptake==
The components of the ''H. influenzae'' pathway necessary for NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, NMN, and NR uptake have been determined. Merdanovic et al. characterized two enzymes, an outer membrane nucleotide phosphatase, and an NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; nucleotidase (NadN) located in the periplasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kemmer G, Reilly TJ, Schmidt-Brauns J, Zlotnik GW, Green BA, Fiske MJ, Herbert M, Kraiss A, Schlör S, Smith A, Reidl J | title = NadN and e (P4) are essential for utilization of NAD and nicotinamide mononucleotide but not nicotinamide riboside in Haemophilus influenzae | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 183 | issue = 13 | pages = 3974–81 | date = July 2001 | pmid = 11395461 | pmc = 95280 | doi = 10.1128/JB.183.13.3974-3981.2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reidl J, Schlör S, Kraiss A, Schmidt-Brauns J, Kemmer G, Soleva E | title = NADP and NAD utilization in Haemophilus influenzae | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 35 | issue = 6 | pages = 1573–81 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10760156 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2958.2000.01829.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmidt-Brauns J, Herbert M, Kemmer G, Kraiss A, Schlör S, Reidl J | title = Is a NAD pyrophosphatase activity necessary for Haemophilus influenzae type b multiplication in the blood stream? | journal = International Journal of Medical Microbiology | volume = 291 | issue = 3 | pages = 219–25 | date = August 2001 | pmid = 11554562 | doi = 10.1078/1438-4221-00122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They showed that NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NMN cross the outer membrane mainly via the OmpP2 porin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Andersen C, Maier E, Kemmer G, Blass J, Hilpert AK, Benz R, Reidl J | title = Porin OmpP2 of Haemophilus influenzae shows specificity for nicotinamide-derived nucleotide substrates | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 278 | issue = 27 | pages = 24269–76 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12695515 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M213087200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only NR can be utilized by the PnuC transport system located in the inner membrane.&lt;ref name="Herbert_2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Herbert M, Sauer E, Smethurst G, Kraiss A, Hilpert AK, Reidl J | title = Nicotinamide ribosyl uptake mutants in Haemophilus influenzae | journal = Infection and Immunity | volume = 71 | issue = 9 | pages = 5398–401 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 12933892 | pmc = 187334 | doi = 10.1128/iai.71.9.5398-5401.2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sauer E, Merdanovic M, Mortimer AP, Bringmann G, Reidl J | title = PnuC and the utilization of the nicotinamide riboside analog 3-aminopyridine in Haemophilus influenzae | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 48 | issue = 12 | pages = 4532–41 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15561822 | pmc = 529221 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.48.12.4532-4541.2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''pnuC'' gene product is the protein that is responsible for the main flow of the NR substrate into the cytoplasm. The study of Merdanovic et al. suggests that the RNK activity of NadR determines NR transport and is negatively regulated by cytoplasmic NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; feedback inhibition. Therefore, NR uptake is under NadR feedback control.&lt;ref name="Merdanovic_2005" /&gt;

ATP, not the [[proton motive force]], appears to be required for NR uptake. Thus, the driving force for NR uptake via PnuC is NR phosphorylation by NadR. A concerted group translocation mechanism can be considered whereby NadR facilitates the dissociation of NR from PnuC by phosphorylating it to NMN, thus preventing efflux of NR.

===Transport reaction===
The proposed transport reaction catalyzed by PnuC and NadR is:&lt;ref name="TCB" /&gt;

NR (out) + ATP (in) → NMN (in) + ADP (in).

== Structure ==
PnuC of ''[[Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica|Salmonella typhimurium]]'' and ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' are [[integral membrane protein]]s, 239 and 226 amino acyl residues (aas) in length, respectively, with 7 putative [[Transmembrane domain|transmembrane]] [[Alpha helix|α-helical segments]].

The structure of NadR has been determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Singh SK, Kurnasov OV, Chen B, Robinson H, Grishin NV, Osterman AL, Zhang H | title = Crystal structure of Haemophilus influenzae NadR protein.

PnuC has been shown to resemble SWEET porters in overall fold,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jaehme M, Guskov A, Slotboom DJ | title = Pnu Transporters: Ain't They SWEET? | journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences | volume = 41 | issue = 2 | pages = 117–118 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26692123 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibs.2015.11.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; supporting the conclusion that these two families are members of the TOG superfamily.&lt;ref name="Yee_2013" /&gt;

The NRAMP family is a member of the large [[APC Superfamily]] of secondary carriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vastermark A, Wollwage S, Houle ME, Rio R, Saier MH | title = Expansion of the APC superfamily of secondary carriers | journal = Proteins | volume = 82 | issue = 10 | pages = 2797–811 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25043943 | pmc = 4177346 | doi = 10.1002/prot.24643 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Homologues of this family are found in various [[yeast]]s, [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[archaea]], and [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] and [[Gram-positive bacteria]] termed "natural resistance-associated" [[macrophage]] proteins because one of the animal homologues plays a role in resistance to intracellular bacterial [[pathogen]]s such as ''[https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Salmonella_enterica_serovar_Typhi Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium]'', ''[[Leishmania donovani]]'' and ''[[Mycobacterium bovis]]''. The natural history of ''SLC11'' genes in vertebrates has been discussed by Neves et al. (2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Neves JV, Wilson JM, Kuhl H, Reinhardt R, Castro LF, Rodrigues PN | title = Natural history of SLC11 genes in vertebrates: tales from the fish world | journal = BMC Evolutionary Biology | volume = 11 | pages = 106 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21501491 | pmc = 3103463 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2148-11-106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed to be a distant member of the [[APC Superfamily]], several human pathologies may result from defects in NRAMP-dependent Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport, including iron overload, neurodegenerative diseases and innate susceptibility to infectious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cellier MF | title = Nramp: from sequence to structure and mechanism of divalent metal import | journal = Current Topics in Membranes | volume = 69 | pages = 249–93 | date = 2012-01-01 | pmid = 23046654 | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-12-394390-3.00010-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NRAMP2==
{{Main|DMT1}}
Humans and rodents possess two distinct NRAMPs. The broad specificity NRAMP2 (DMT1), which transports a range of divalent metal cations, transports Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; with a 1:1 stoichiometry and apparent affinities of 6 μm and about 1 μm, respectively. Variable H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;:Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; stoichiometry has also been reported. The order of substrate preference for NRAMP2 is:

Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&gt; Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&gt; Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&gt; Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&gt; Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&gt; Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&gt; Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&gt; Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;

Many of these ions can inhibit iron absorption. Mutation of NRAMP2 in rodents leads to defective [[Endosome|endosomal]] iron export within the ferritin cycle, impaired intestinal iron absorption and [[microcytic anemia]]. Symptoms of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; deficiency are also seen. It is found in apical membranes of intestinal epithelial cells but also in late [[endosome]]s and [[lysosome]]s.

==NRAMP1==
{{Main|SLC11A1}}
In contrast to the widely expressed NRAMP2, NRAMP1 is expressed primarily in [[macrophage]]s and [[monocyte]]s and appears to have a preference for Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; rather than Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. NRAMP1 ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.55.2.3 TC# 2.A.55.2.3]) has been reported to function by metal:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Techau ME, Valdez-Taubas J, Popoff JF, Francis R, Seaman M, Blackwell JM | title = Evolution of differences in transport function in Slc11a family members | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 282 | issue = 49 | pages = 35646–56 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 17932044 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M707057200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hypothesized that a deficiency for Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or some other metal prevents the generation of reactive oxygenic and nitrogenic compounds that are used by macrophage to combat pathogens. This hypothesis is supported by studies on the bacterial NRAMP homologues which exhibit extremely high selectivity for Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; over Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and other divalent cations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wei W, Chai T, Zhang Y, Han L, Xu J, Guan Z | title = The Thlaspi caerulescens NRAMP homologue TcNRAMP3 is capable of divalent cation transport | journal = Molecular Biotechnology | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–21 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 18663607 | doi = 10.1007/s12033-008-9088-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulation of these transporters in bacteria can occur through Fur, OxyR, and most commonly a DtxR homolog, MntR.

==Smf and other homologues==
The Smf1 protein of ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' appears to catalyze high-affinity (''K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0.3 μm) Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake while the closely related Smf2 protein may catalyze low affinity (''K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 60 μm) Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake in the same organism. Both proteins also mediate H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake. These proteins are of 575 and 549 amino acyl residues in length and are predicted to have 8-12 transmembrane α-helical spanners. The ''E. coli'' homologue of 412 aas exhibits 11 putative and confirmed TMSs with the N-terminus in and the C-terminus out. The yeast proteins may be localized to the vacuole and/or the plasma membrane of the yeast cell. Indirect and some direct experiments suggest that they may be able to transport several heavy metals including Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. A third yeast protein, Smf3p, appears to be exclusively intracellular, possibly in the Golgi. NRAMP2 (''[[SLC11A2|Slc11A2]]'') of Homo sapiens ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.55.2.1 TC# 2.A.55.2.1]) has a 12 TMS topology with intracellular N- and C-termini. Two-fold structural symmetry in the arrangement of membrane helices for TM1-5 and TM6-10 (conserved Slc2 hydrophobic core) is suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Czachorowski M, Lam-Yuk-Tseung S, Cellier M, Gros P | title = Transmembrane topology of the mammalian Slc11a2 iron transporter | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 48 | issue = 35 | pages = 8422–34 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19621945 | pmc = 2736113 | doi = 10.1021/bi900606y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport reaction==
The generalized transport reaction catalyzed by NRAMP family proteins is:

Me&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) ⇌ Me&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (in) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in).

The '''Formate-Nitrite Transporter (FNT) Family''' belongs to the [[Major intrinsic proteins|Major Intrinsic Protein (MIP) Superfamily]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reizer J, Reizer A, Saier MH | title = The MIP family of integral membrane channel proteins: sequence comparisons, evolutionary relationships, reconstructed pathway of evolution, and proposed functional differentiation of the two repeated halves of the proteins | journal = Critical Reviews in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 235–57 | date = 1993-01-01 | pmid = 8325040 | doi = 10.3109/10409239309086796 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Park JH, Saier MH | title = Phylogenetic characterization of the MIP family of transmembrane channel proteins | journal = The Journal of Membrane Biology | volume = 153 | issue = 3 | pages = 171–80 | date = October 1996 | pmid = 8849412 | doi = 10.1007/s002329900120 }}&lt;/ref&gt; FNT family members have been sequenced from [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] and [[Gram-positive bacteria]], [[archaea]], [[yeast]], plants and lower eukaryotes. The [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] proteins of the FNT family probably function in the transport of the structurally related compounds, [[formate]] and [[nitrite]].&lt;ref name="pmid8022272"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Suppmann B, Sawers G | title = Isolation and characterization of hypophosphite--resistant mutants of Escherichia coli: identification of the FocA protein, encoded by the pfl operon, as a putative formate transporter | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 965–82 | date = March 1994 | pmid = 8022272 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.1994.tb00375.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
With the exception of the yeast protein (627 amino acyl residues), all characterized members of the family are of 256-285 residues in length and exhibit 6-8 putative transmembrane α-helical spanners (TMSs). In one case, that of the ''E. coli'' FocA ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.1.1 TC# 1.A.16.1.1]) protein, a 6 TMS topology has been established.&lt;ref name = "Wang_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang Y, Huang Y, Wang J, Cheng C, Huang W, Lu P, Xu YN, Wang P, Yan N, Shi Y | title = Structure of the formate transporter FocA reveals a pentameric aquaporin-like channel | journal = Nature | volume = 462 | issue = 7272 | pages = 467–72 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19940917 | doi = 10.1038/nature08610 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The yeast protein has a similar apparent topology but has a large C-terminal hydrophilic extension of about 400 residues.

FocA of ''E. coli'' is a symmetriv [[pentamer]], with each subunit consisting of six TMSs.&lt;ref name = "Wang_2009" /&gt;

== Phylogeny ==
The phylogenetic tree shows clustering according to function and organismal phylogeny. The putative formate efflux transporters (FocA; TC#s [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.1.1 1.A.16.1.1] and [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.1.3 1.A.16.1.3]) of bacteria associated with pyruvate-formate lyase (pfl) comprise cluster I; the putative formate uptake permeases (FdhC; TC#s [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.2.1 1.A.16.2.1] and [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.2.3 1.A.16.2.3]) of bacteria and archaea associated with formate dehydrogenase comprise cluster II; the nitrite uptake permeases (NirC, TC#s [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.2.5 1.A.16.2.5], [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.3.1 1.A.16.3.1], and [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.2.4 1.A.16.3.4]) of bacteria comprise cluster III, and a yeast protein comprises cluster IV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16#ref9123|title = 1.A.16 The Formate-Nitrite Transporter (FNT) Family|date = |access-date = |website = Transporter Classification Database|publisher = Saier Lab Bioinformatics Group / SDSC|last = Saier|first = MH Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
The energy coupling mechanisms for proteins of the FNT family have not been extensively characterized. HCO{{su|b=2|p=−}} and NO{{su|b=2|p=−}} uptakes may be coupled to H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; symport. HCO{{su|b=2|p=−}} efflux may be driven by the membrane potential by a uniport mechanism or by H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiport. FocA of ''E. coli'' catalyzes bidirectional [[formate]] transport and may function by a channel-type mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Falke D, Schulz K, Doberenz C, Beyer L, Lilie H, Thiemer B, Sawers RG | title = Unexpected oligomeric structure of the FocA formate channel of Escherichia coli : a paradigm for the formate-nitrite transporter family of integral membrane proteins | journal = FEMS Microbiology Letters | volume = 303 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–75 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20041954 | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-6968.2009.01862.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

FocA, transports short-chain acids. FocA may be able to switch its mode of operation from a passive export channel at high external pH to a secondary active formate/H+ importer at low pH. The crystal structure of ''[[Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica|Salmonella typhimurium]]'' FocA at pH 4.0 shows that this switch involves a major rearrangement of the amino termini of individual protomers in the pentameric channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lü W, Du J, Wacker T, Gerbig-Smentek E, Andrade SL, Einsle O | title = pH-dependent gating in a FocA formate channel | journal = Science | volume = 332 | issue = 6027 | pages = 352–4 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21493860 | doi = 10.1126/science.1199098 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The amino-terminal helices open or block transport in a concerted, cooperative action that indicates how FocA is gated in a pH-dependent way. Electrophysiological studies show that the protein acts as a specific formate channel at pH 7.0 and that it closes upon a shift of pH to 5.1.

=== Transport Reaction ===
The probable transport reactions catalyzed by different members of the FNT family are:

(1) RCO{{su|b=2|p=−}} or NO{{su|b=2|p=−}} (out) ⇌ RCO{{su|b=2|p=−}} or NO{{su|b=2|p=−}} (in),

(2) HCO{{su|b=2|p=−}} (in) ⇌ HCO{{su|b=2|p=−}} (out),

(3) HS&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (out) ⇌ HS&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (in).

== Members ==
A representative list of the currently classified members belonging to the FNT family can be found in the [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.5 Transporter Classification Database]. Some characterized members include:

*FocA and FocB (TC#s [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.1.1 1.A.16.1.1] and [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.1.2 1.A.16.1.2], respectively), from ''Escherichia coli'', [[membrane transporter protein|transporter]]s involved in the bidirectional [[transport]] of formate. 
*FdhC, from ''Methanobacterium maripaludis'' (TC# [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.2.3 1.A.16.2.3]) and ''Methanothermobacter'' thermoformicicum (TC# [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.2.1 1.A.16.2.1]), a probable formate transporter. 
*NirC, from E. coli (TC# [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.3.1 1.A.16.3.1]), a probable nitrite transporter.

There are 9 mammalian paralogues, ZnT1 - 8 and 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mammalian zinc transport, trafficking, and signals|journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date = 2006-08-25|issn = 0021-9258|pmid = 16793761|pages = 24085–24089|volume = 281|issue = 34|doi = 10.1074/jbc.R600011200|first = Robert J.|last = Cousins|first2 = Juan P.|last2 = Liuzzi|first3 = Louis A.|last3 = Lichten}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most proteins from the family have six transmembrane helices, but MSC2 of ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|S. cerevisiae]]'') and Znt5 and hZTL1 of ''[[Homo sapiens|H. sapiens]]'' have 15 and 12 predicted TMSs, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A novel zinc-regulated human zinc transporter, hZTL1, is localized to the enterocyte apical membrane|journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date = 2002-06-21|issn = 0021-9258|pmid = 11937503|pages = 22789–22797|volume = 277|issue = 25|doi = 10.1074/jbc.M200577200|first = Ruth A.|last = Cragg|first2 = Graham R.|last2 = Christie|first3 = Siôn R.|last3 = Phillips|first4 = Rachel M.|last4 = Russi|first5 = Sébastien|last5 = Küry|first6 = John C.|last6 = Mathers|first7 = Peter M.|last7 = Taylor|first8 = Dianne|last8 = Ford}}&lt;/ref&gt; These proteins exhibit an unusual degree of sequence divergence and size variation (300-750 residues). Eukaryotic proteins exhibit differences in cell localization. Some catalyze heavy metal uptake from the cytoplasm into various intracellular eukaryotic organelles (ZnT2-7) while others (ZnT1) catalyze efflux from the cytoplasm across the plasma membrane into the extracellular medium.

=== Phylogeny ===
Prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins cluster separately but may function with the same polarity by similar mechanisms. These proteins are secondary carriers which utilize the proton motive force (pmf) and function by H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiport (for metal efflux). One member, CzcD of ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.4.1.3 TC# 2.A.4.1.3]) '','' has been shown to exchange the divalent cation (Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ) for two monovalent cations (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ) in an electroneutral process energized by the transmembrane pH gradient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An antiport mechanism for a member of the cation diffusion facilitator family: divalent cations efflux in exchange for K+ and H+|journal = Molecular Microbiology|date = 2002-07-01|issn = 0950-382X|pmid = 12100555|pages = 145–153|volume = 45|issue = 1|first = Arthur A.|last = Guffanti|first2 = Yi|last2 = Wei|first3 = Sacha V.|last3 = Rood|first4 = Terry A.|last4 = Krulwich|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2958.2002.02998.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another, ZitB of ''E. coli'' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.4.1.4 TC #2.A.4.1.4]), has been reconstituted in proteoliposomes and studied kinetically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Kinetic study of the antiport mechanism of an Escherichia coli zinc transporter, ZitB|journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date = 2004-03-26|issn = 0021-9258|pmid = 14715669|pages = 12043–12050|volume = 279|issue = 13|doi = 10.1074/jbc.M313510200|first = Yang|last = Chao|first2 = Dax|last2 = Fu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears to function by simple Me&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiport with a 1:1 stoichiometry.

Montanini et al. (2007) have conducted phylogenetic analysis of CDF family members. Their analysis revealed three major and two minor phylogenetic groups. They suggest that the three major groups segregated according to metal ion specificity:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Phylogenetic and functional analysis of the Cation Diffusion Facilitator (CDF) family: improved signature and prediction of substrate specificity|journal = BMC Genomics|date = 2007-01-01|issn = 1471-2164|pmc = 1868760|pmid = 17448255|pages = 107|volume = 8|doi = 10.1186/1471-2164-8-107|first = Barbara|last = Montanini|first2 = Damien|last2 = Blaudez|first3 = Sylvain|last3 = Jeandroz|first4 = Dale|last4 = Sanders|first5 = Michel|last5 = Chalot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
# Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; 
# Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; as well as other metal ions 
# Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; plus other metals, but not Iron.

=== Structure ===
X-ray structure of YiiP of ''E. coli'' represents a homodimer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Oligomeric state of the Escherichia coli metal transporter YiiP|journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date = 2004-09-17|issn = 0021-9258|pmid = 15258151|pages = 39251–39259|volume = 279|issue = 38|doi = 10.1074/jbc.M407044200|first = Yinan|last = Wei|first2 = Huilin|last2 = Li|first3 = Dax|last3 = Fu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Structure of the zinc transporter YiiP|journal = Science|date = 2007-09-21|issn = 1095-9203|pmid = 17717154|pages = 1746–1748|volume = 317|issue = 5845|doi = 10.1126/science.1143748|first = Min|last = Lu|first2 = Dax|last2 = Fu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coudray et al. (2013) used cryoelectron microscopy to determine a 13 Å resolution structure of a YiiP homolog from ''[[Shewanella oneidensis]]'' within a lipid bilayer in the absence of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Starting from the x-ray structure in the presence of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, they used molecular dynamic flexible fitting to build a model. Comparison of the structures suggested a conformational change that involves pivoting of a transmembrane, four-helix bundle (M1, M2, M4, and M5) relative to the M3-M6 helix pair. Although accessibility of transport sites in the x-ray model indicates that it represents an outward-facing state, their model was consistent with an inward-facing state, suggesting that the conformational change is relevant to the alternating access mechanism for transport. They speculated that the dimer may coordinate rearrangement of the transmembrane helices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Inward-facing conformation of the zinc transporter YiiP revealed by cryoelectron microscopy|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date = 2013-02-05|issn = 1091-6490|pmc = 3568326|pmid = 23341604|pages = 2140–2145|volume = 110|issue = 6|doi = 10.1073/pnas.1215455110|first = Nicolas|last = Coudray|first2 = Salvatore|last2 = Valvo|first3 = Minghui|last3 = Hu|first4 = Ralph|last4 = Lasala|first5 = Changki|last5 = Kim|first6 = Martin|last6 = Vink|first7 = Ming|last7 = Zhou|first8 = Davide|last8 = Provasi|first9 = Marta|last9 = Filizola}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Involved in metal tolerance/resistance by efflux, most CDF proteins share a two-modular architecture consisting of a [[transmembrane domain]] (TMD) and a [[C-terminus|C-terminal domain]] (CTD) that protrudes into the cytoplasm. A Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; CDF transporter from the marine bacterium, ''Maricaulis maris,'' that does not possess the CTD is a member of a new, CTD-lacking subfamily of CDFs.

=== Transport Reaction ===
The generalized transport reaction for CDF family members is:

Me&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (in) H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) ± K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) → Me&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in) ± K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in).

[[File:Shimmering bees drive hornet away.ogv|thumb|A population of bees shimmers in response to a predator.]]

'''Biological organization''' is the [[hierarchy]] of [[complex systems|complex]] [[biology|biological]] [[structures]] and [[systems]] that define [[life]] using a [[Reductionism|reductionistic]] approach.&lt;ref name="Solomon intro"&gt;{{harvnb|Solomon|Berg|Martin|2002|pp=9&amp;ndash;10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional hierarchy, as detailed below, extends from [[atom]]s to [[biosphere]]s. The higher levels of this scheme are often referred to as an '''ecological organization''' concept, or as the [[Branches of science|field]],  [[#Fundamentals|hierarchical ecology]].

Each level in the hierarchy represents an increase in organizational [[wikt:complexity|complexity]], with each "object" being primarily composed of the previous level's basic unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pavé|2006|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic principle behind the organization is the concept of ''[[emergence]]''—the properties and functions found at a hierarchical level are not present and irrelevant at the lower levels.

The biological organization of life is a fundamental premise for numerous areas of [[scientific research]], particularly in the [[Medicine|medical sciences]]. Without this necessary degree of organization, it would be much more difficult—and likely impossible—to apply the study of the effects of various [[physical phenomenon|physical]] and [[chemical phenomenon|chemical]] phenomena to [[diseases]] and [[physiology]] (body function). For example, fields such as [[cognitive neuroscience|cognitive]] and [[behavioral neuroscience]] could not exist if the brain was not composed of specific types of cells, and the basic concepts of [[pharmacology]] could not exist if it was not known that a change at the cellular level can affect an entire organism. These applications extend into the [[ecological]] levels as well. For example, [[DDT]]'s direct [[insecticide|insecticidal]] effect occurs at the [[subcellular]] level, but affects higher levels up to and including multiple [[ecosystem]]s. Theoretically, a change in one [[atom]] could change the entire [[biosphere]].

==Levels==
[[File:Levels of Organization.svg|thumb|The simplest unit of life is the atom, like oxygen. Two or more atoms is a molecule, like a dioxide. Many small molecules may combine in a chemical reaction to make up a macromolecule, such as a phospholipid. Multiple macromolecules form a cell, like a club cell. A group of cells functioning together as a tissue, for example, Epithelial tissue. Different tissues make up an organ, like a lung. Organs work together to form an organ system, such as the Respiratory System. All of the organ systems make a living organism, like a lion. A group of the same organism living together in an area is a population, such as a pride of lions. Two or more populations interacting with each other form a community, for example, lion and zebra populations interacting with each other.  Communities interacting not only with each other but also with the physical environment encompass an ecosystem, such as the Savanna ecosystem. All of the ecosystems make up the biosphere, the area of life on Earth.]]
The simple standard biological organization scheme, from the lowest level to the highest level, is as follows:&lt;ref name="Solomon intro"/&gt;

More complex schemes incorporate many more levels. For example, a molecule can be viewed as a grouping of [[chemical element|elements]], and an atom can be further divided into [[subatomic particle]]s (these levels are outside the scope of biological organization). Each level can also be broken down into its own hierarchy, and specific types of these biological objects can have their own hierarchical scheme. For example, [[genome]]s can be further subdivided into a hierarchy of [[gene]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pavé|2006|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each level in the hierarchy can be described by its lower levels. For example, the organism may be described at any of its component levels, including the atomic, molecular, cellular, histological (tissue), organ and organ system levels. Furthermore, at every level of the hierarchy, new functions necessary for the control of life appear. These new roles are not functions that the lower level components are capable of and are thus referred to as ''[[Emergence#Emergent properties and processes|emergent properties]]''.

Every organism is organised, though not necessarily to the same degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Postlethwait|Hopson|2006|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An organism can not be organised at the [[histological]] (tissue) level if it is not composed of tissues in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Witzany | first1 = G | year = 2014 | title = Biological Self-organization | url = | journal = International Journal of Signs and Semiotic Systems | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 1–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundamentals ==
Empirically, a large proportion of the (complex) biological systems we observe in nature exhibit hierarchic structure. On theoretical grounds we could expect complex systems to be hierarchies in a world in which complexity had to evolve from simplicity. [[Systems theory|System]] hierarchies analysis performed in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; laid the empirical foundations for a [[Branches of science|field]] that would be, from the 1980s, '''hierarchical ecology'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Margalef|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wicken|Ulanowicz|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pumain|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jordan|Jørgensen|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theoretical foundations are summarized by thermodynamics.
When [[biological systems]] are modeled as [[physical system]]s, in its most general abstraction, they are [[Thermodynamic system#Open system|thermodynamic open systems]] that exhibit [[self-organization|self-organised]] behavior, and the [[Set theory|set/subset]] relations between [[dissipative structures]] can be characterized in a hierarchy.

A simpler and more direct way to explain the fundamentals of the "hierarchical organization of life", was introduced in [[Ecology]] by [[Howard T. Odum|Odum]] and others as the "[[Herbert A. Simon|Simon]]'s hierarchical principle";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simon|1969|pp=192–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon&lt;ref&gt;Simon's texts at {{doi|10.1207/S15327809JLS1203_4}}, [http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/simon.html polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/simon]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705161014/http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/simon.html |date=July 5, 2015 }} or [http://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/08/29/hierarchical-organization-and-biological-evolution-part-1/ johncarlosbaez/2011/08/29 transcriptions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531145800/https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/08/29/hierarchical-organization-and-biological-evolution-part-1/ |date=2015-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized that hierarchy "''emerges almost inevitably through a wide variety of evolutionary processes, for the simple reason that &lt;u&gt;hierarchical structures are stable&lt;/u&gt;''".

To motivate this deep idea, he offered his "parable" about imaginary watchmakers.

:{|
!Parable of the Watchmakers
|-
|
There once were two watchmakers, named Hora and Tempus, who made very fine watches. The phones in their workshops rang frequently; new customers were constantly calling them. However, Hora prospered while Tempus became poorer and poorer. In the end, Tempus lost his shop. What was the reason behind this?

The watches consisted of about 1000 parts each. The watches that Tempus made were designed such that, when he had to put down a partly assembled watch (for instance, to answer the phone), it immediately fell into pieces and had to be reassembled from the basic elements.

Hora had designed his watches so that he could put together subassemblies of about ten components each. Ten of these subassemblies could be put together to make a larger sub-assembly. Finally, ten of the larger subassemblies constituted the whole watch. Each subassembly could be put down without falling apart.

A '''biologist''' is a [[scientist]] who has specialized knowledge in the field of [[biology]], the scientific study of [[life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/biology|title=the definition of biology|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologists involved in fundamental research attempt to explore and further explain the underlying mechanisms that govern the functioning of living matter. Biologists involved in applied research attempt to develop or improve more specific processes and understanding, in fields such as [[medicine]] and [[industry]].

Biologists are interested in understanding the underlying mechanisms that govern the functioning of living matter as well as the complex properties that emerge from the biophysical, biochemical, cellular and systemic interactions of [[Organism|living systems]]. Biologists conduct research using the [[scientific method]] to test the validity of a theory in a rational, unbiased and reproducible manner. This consists of [[hypothesis]] formation, [[experiment]]ation and [[data analysis]] to establish the validity or invalidity of a scientific theory.

There are different types of biologists. [[Theoretical Biology|Theoretical biologists]] use mathematical methods and develop [[Mathematical model|models]] to understand  phenomena and ideally predict future experimental results, while [[Experimental biology|experimental biologists]] conceive experiments to test those predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-12-07|title=On the origin of non-membrane-bound organelles, and their physiological function|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519317301546|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|language=en|volume=434|pages=42–49|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2017.04.006|pmid=28392184|pmc=5630510|issn=0022-5193|last1=Stroberg|first1=Wylie|last2=Schnell|first2=Santiago}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Molecular Biology, Principles of Genome Function|last=Craig|first=Nancy|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=9780199658572|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some biologists work on [[Microorganism|microorganisms]], while others study [[Multicellular organism|multicellular]] organisms (including [[Homo sapiens|humans]]). Some investigate the nano or micro-scale, others emergent properties such as [[Ecology|ecological interactions]] or [[Neuroscience|cognition]]. There is much overlap between different fields of biology (e.g. [[zoology]], [[microbiology]], [[genetics]] and [[evolutionary biology]]) and due to the interdisciplinary nature of the field it is often difficult to classify a life scientist as only one of them. Many biological scientists work in research and development. Some conduct fundamental research to advance human knowledge of life. Furthermore, applied biological research often aids the development of solutions to problems in areas such as human health and the natural environment. Biological scientists mostly work in government, university, and private industry [[Laboratory|laboratories]]. 

==Research==
[[File:Mwb in lab-2.jpg|thumb|[[Martinus Willem Beijerinck]], a botanist and microbiologist]]
Biologists who work in basic research formulates theories and devise experiments to advance human knowledge on life including topics such as [[evolution]], [[biochemistry]], [[Molecular biology|molecular biology,]] [[neuroscience]] and [[cell biology]].

Biological scientists who work in applied research use instead the accomplishments gained by basic research to further knowledge in particular fields or applications. For example, this applied research may be used to develop new [[pharmaceutical drug]]s, treatments and medical [[diagnostic test]]s. Biological scientists conducting applied research and product development in private industry may be required to describe their research plans or results to non-scientists who are in a position to veto or approve their ideas. These scientists must consider the business effects of their work.

While theoretical biologists usually works in "dry" labs, formulating mathematical models and running computer simulations, some experimental biologists conduct laboratory experiments involving [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[Microorganism|microorganisms]] or [[Biomolecule|biomolecules]]. However, a small part of experimental biological research also occurs outside the laboratory and may involve natural observation rather than experimentation. For example, a botanist may investigate the plant species present in a particular environment, while an ecologist might study how a forest area recovers after a fire.

Swift advances in knowledge of genetics and organic molecules spurred growth in the field of biotechnology, transforming the industries in which biological scientists work. Biological scientists can now manipulate the genetic material of animals and plants, attempting to make organisms (including humans) more productive or resistant to disease. Basic and applied research on biotechnological processes, such as recombining DNA, has led to the production of important substances, including human insulin and growth hormone. Many other substances not previously available in large quantities are now produced by biotechnological means. Some of these substances are useful in treating diseases.

Those working on various genome (chromosomes with their associated genes) projects isolate genes and determine their function. This work continues to lead to the discovery of genes associated with specific diseases and inherited health risks, such as sickle cell anemia. Advances in biotechnology have created research opportunities in almost all areas of biology, with commercial applications in areas such as medicine, agriculture, and [[environmental remediation]].

==Specialists==
Most biological scientists specialize in the study of a certain type of organism or in a specific activity, although recent advances have blurred some traditional classifications.{{why|provide explanation of this and sources|date=October 2013}}
* [[Geneticist]]s study [[genetics]], the science of [[genes]], [[heredity]], and [[Genetic variation|variation]] of [[organism]]s.
* [[Neuroscientist]]s study the [[nervous system]].
* [[Developmental biology|Developmental biologists]] study the process of development and growth of [[organism]]s
* [[Biochemistry|Biochemists]] study the chemical composition of living things. They analyze the complex chemical combinations and reactions involved in [[metabolism]], [[reproduction]], and growth.
* [[Molecular biology|Molecular biologists]] study the [[Biology|biological]] activity between [[biomolecule]]s.
* [[Microbiology|Microbiologists]] investigate the growth and characteristics of microscopic organisms such as [[bacteria]], [[algae]], or [[Fungus|fungi]].
* [[Physiology|Physiologists]] study life functions of plants and animals,  in the whole organism and at the cellular or molecular level, under normal and abnormal conditions. Physiologists often specialize in functions such as growth, reproduction, [[photosynthesis]], respiration, or movement, or in the physiology of a certain area or system of the organism.
* [[Biophysics|Biophysicists]] use experimental methods traditionally employed in [[physics]] to answer biological questions .
* [[Computational Biology|Computational Biologists]] apply the techniques of [[computer science]], [[applied mathematics]] and [[statistics]] to address biological problems. The main focus lies on developing [[mathematical modeling]] and computational simulation techniques. By these means it addresses scientific research topics with their theoretical and experimental questions without a laboratory.
* [[Zoology|Zoologists]] and wildlife biologists study animals and wildlife—their origin, behavior, diseases, and life processes. Some experiment with live animals in controlled or natural surroundings, while others dissect dead animals to study their structure. Zoologists and wildlife biologists also may collect and analyze biological data to determine the environmental effects of current and potential uses of land and water areas. Zoologists usually are identified by the animal group they study. For example, [[ornithology|ornithologists]] study [[bird]]s, [[mammalogy|mammalogists]] study [[mammal]]s, [[herpetology|herpetologists]] study [[reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s, [[ichthyology|ichthyologists]] study [[fish]], [[cnidariologist]]s study [[jellyfish]]es and [[entomologist]]s study insects.
* [[Botany|Botanists]] study plants and their environments. Some study all aspects of plant life, including [[algae]], [[lichen]]s, [[moss]]es, [[fern]]s, [[Pinophyta|conifers]], and [[flowering plant]]s; others specialize in areas such as identification and classification of plants, the structure and function of plant parts, the biochemistry of plant processes, the causes and cures of plant diseases, the interaction of plants with other organisms and the environment, the geological record of plants and their evolution.  [[Mycology|Mycologists]] study [[fungi]], such as [[yeasts]], [[mold]] and [[mushrooms]], which are a separate kingdom from plants.
* Aquatic biologists study micro-organisms, plants, and animals living in water. [[Marine Biology|Marine biologists]] study salt water organisms, and limnologists study [[Limnology|fresh water organisms]]. Much of the work of marine biology centers on [[molecular biology]], the study of the biochemical processes that take place inside living cells. Marine biology is a branch of [[oceanography]], which is the study of the biological, chemical, geological, and physical characteristics of oceans and the ocean floor. (See the Handbook statements on environmental scientists and hydrologists and on geoscientists.)
* [[Ecology|Ecologists]] investigate the relationships among organisms and between organisms and their environments, examining the effects of population size, pollutants, rainfall, temperature, and altitude. Using knowledge of various scientific disciplines, ecologists may collect, study, and report data on the quality of air, food, soil, and water.
* [[Evolutionary biology|Evolutionary biologists]] investigate the [[evolution|evolutionary processes]] that produced the [[Biodiversity|diversity of life]] on [[Earth]], starting from [[Last universal common ancestor|a single common ancestor]]. These processes include [[natural selection]], [[common descent]], and [[speciation]].

==Working conditions==
Biological scientists are not usually exposed to unsafe or unhealthy conditions. Those who work with dangerous organisms or [[Toxicity|toxic]] substances in the laboratory must follow strict [[safety]] procedures to avoid [[contamination]]. Many biological scientists, such as botanists, ecologists, and zoologists, conduct field studies that involve strenuous physical activity and primitive living conditions. Biological scientists in the field may work in warm or cold climates, in all kinds of [[weather]].

Marine biologists encounter a variety of working conditions. Some work in laboratories; others work on research ships, and those who work underwater must practice safe diving while working around sharp [[coral reef]]s and hazardous marine life. Although some marine biologists obtain their specimens from the sea, many still spend a good deal of their time in laboratories and offices, conducting tests, running experiments, recording results, and compiling data.

Many biological scientists depend on [[Grant (money)|grant money]] to fund their research. They may be under pressure to meet deadlines and to conform to rigid grant-writing specifications when preparing proposals to seek new or extended funding.

Biological scientists typically work regular hours. While the 40-hour workweek is common, longer hours are not uncommon. Researchers may be required to work odd hours in laboratories or other locations (especially while in the field), depending on the nature of their research.

==Honors and awards==
The highest honor awarded to biologists is the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]], awarded since 1901, by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Another significant award is the [[Crafoord Prize]] in Biosciences; established in 1980.

== Families ==
As of early 2016, there are three families belonging to the MACPF superfamily:
* [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.C.12 1.C.12] - [[Cholesterol-dependent cytolysin|The Thiol-activated Cholesterol-dependent Cytolysin (CDC) Family]]
* [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.C.39 1.C.39] - The Membrane Attack Complex/Perforin (MACPF) Family
* [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.C.97 1.C.97] - [[Pleurotolysin|The Pleurotolysin Pore-forming (Pleurotolysin) Family]]

=== Membrane Attack Complex/Perforin (MACPF) Family  ===
Proteins containing MACPF domains play key roles in vertebrate immunity, embryonic development, and neural-cell migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Disparate proteins use similar architectures to damage membranes|journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences|date = 2008-10-01|issn = 0968-0004|pmid = 18778941|pages = 482–490|volume = 33|issue = 10|doi = 10.1016/j.tibs.2008.07.004|first = Gregor|last = Anderluh|first2 = Jeremy H.|last2 = Lakey}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ninth component of complement and perforin form oligomeric pores that lyse bacteria and kill virus-infected cells, respectively. The crystal structure of a bacterial MACPF protein, Plu-MACPF from ''Photorhabdus luminescens'' was determined ({{PDB|2QP2}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A common fold mediates vertebrate defense and bacterial attack|journal = Science |date = 2007-09-14|issn = 1095-9203|pmid = 17717151|pages = 1548–1551|volume = 317|issue = 5844|doi = 10.1126/science.1144706|first = Carlos J.|last = Rosado|first2 = Ashley M.|last2 = Buckle|first3 = Ruby H.

A representative list of proteins belonging to the MACPF family can be found in the [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.C.39.9 Transporter Classification Database].

== Biological roles of MACPF domain containing proteins ==
Many proteins belonging to the MACPF superfamily play key roles in plant and animal immunity.

[[Complement system|Complement proteins]] C6-C9 all contain a MACPF domain and assemble into the membrane attack complex.  C6, C7 and C8β appear to be non-lytic and function as scaffold proteins within the MAC. In contrast both C8α and C9 are capable of lysing cells. The final stage of MAC formation involves polymerisation of C9 into a large pore that punches a hole in the outer membrane of [[gram-negative bacteria]].

[[Perforin]] is stored in granules within cytotoxic T-cells and is responsible for killing virally infected and transformed cells. Perforin functions via two distinct mechanisms. Firstly, like C9, high concentrations of perforin can form pores that lyse cells. Secondly, perforin permits delivery of the cytotoxic granzymes A and B into target cells. Once delivered, granzymes are able to induce apoptosis and cause target cell death.&lt;ref name="Voskoboinik I, Smyth MJ, Trapani JA 2006 940–52"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Kaiserman D, Bird CH, Sun J, etal |title=The major human and mouse granzymes are structurally and functionally divergent |journal=J.

The plant protein CAD1 ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.C.39.11.3 TC# 1.C.39.11.3]) functions in the plant immune response to bacterial infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Morita-Yamamuro C, Tsutsui T, Sato M, etal |title=The Arabidopsis gene CAD1 controls programmed cell death in the plant immune system and encodes a protein containing a MACPF domain |journal=Plant Cell Physiol. |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=902–12 |year=2005 |pmid=15799997 |doi=10.1093/pcp/pci095}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Salicylic acid and a chitin elicitor both control expression of the CAD1 gene involved in the plant immunity of Arabidopsis|journal = Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry|date = 2006-09-01|issn = 0916-8451|pmid = 16960394|pages = 2042–2048|volume = 70|issue = 9|doi = 10.1271/bbb.50700|first = Tomokazu|last = Tsutsui|first2 = Chizuko|last2 = Morita-Yamamuro|first3 = Yutaka|last3 = Asada|first4 = Eiichi|last4 = Minami|first5 = Naoto|last5 = Shibuya|first6 = Akira|last6 = Ikeda|first7 = Junji|last7 = Yamaguchi|hdl = 2115/14840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[sea anemone]] ''Actineria villosa'' uses a MACPF (AvTX-60A; [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.C.39.10.1 TC# 1.C.39.10.1])protein as a lethal toxin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Oshiro N, Kobayashi C, Iwanaga S, etal |title=A new membrane-attack complex/perforin (MACPF) domain lethal toxin from the nematocyst venom of the Okinawan sea anemone Actineria villosa |journal=Toxicon |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=225–8 |year=2004 |pmid=15019483 |doi=10.1016/j.toxicon.2003.11.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MACPF proteins are also important for the invasion of the [[Malarial]] parasite into the mosquito host and the liver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kadota K, Ishino T, Matsuyama T, Chinzei Y, Yuda M |title=Essential role of membrane-attack protein in malarial transmission to mosquito host |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=101 |issue=46 |pages=16310–5 |year=2004 |pmid=15520375 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0406187101 |pmc=524694}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ishino T, Chinzei Y, Yuda M |title=A Plasmodium sporozoite protein with a membrane attack complex domain is required for breaching the liver sinusoidal cell layer prior to hepatocyte infection |journal=Cell.

Not all MACPF proteins function in defence or attack.  For example, [[astrotactin|astrotactin-1]] ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=9.B.87.3.1 TC# 9.B.87.3.1]) is involved in neural cell migration in mammals and apextrin ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.C.39.7.4 TC# 1.C.39.7.4]) is involved in sea urchin (''[[Heliocidaris erythrogramma]]'') development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zheng C, Heintz N, Hatten ME |title=CNS gene encoding astrotactin, which supports neuronal migration along glial fibers |journal=Science |volume=272 |issue=5260 |pages=417–9 |year=1996 |pmid=8602532 |doi=10.1126/science.272.5260.417}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Haag ES, Sly BJ, Andrews ME, Raff RA |title=Apextrin, a novel extracellular protein associated with larval ectoderm evolution in Heliocidaris erythrogramma |journal=Dev.

Functionally uncharacterised MACPF proteins are sporadically distributed in bacteria. Several species of ''Chlamydia'' contain MACPF proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ponting CP |title=Chlamydial homologues of the MACPF (MAC/perforin) domain |journal=Curr. Biol. |volume=9 |issue=24 |pages=R911–3 |year=1999 |pmid=10608922 |doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(00)80102-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The insect pathogenic bacteria ''[[Photorhabdus luminescens]]'' also contains a MACPF protein, however, this molecule appears non-lytic.&lt;ref name="plumacpf"/&gt;

==Structure and mechanism==
The X-ray crystal structure of Plu-MACPF, a protein from the [[insect]] pathogenic [[enterobacteria]] ''[[Photorhabdus luminescens]]'' has been determined (figure 1).[http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=2QP2]  These data reveal that the MACPF domain is homologous to [[pore forming toxins|pore forming]] cholesterol dependent cytolysins (CDC's) from [[Gram positive|gram-positive]] pathogenic bacteria such as ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'' (which causes [[gas gangrene]]).  The [[amino acid]] sequence identity between the two families is extremely low, and the relationship is not detectable using conventional sequence based data mining techniques.&lt;ref name="plumacpf"/&gt;

It is suggested that MACPF proteins and CDCs form pores in the same way (figure 1).&lt;ref name="plumacpf"/&gt; Specifically it is hypothesised that MACPF proteins oligomerise to form a large circular pore (figure 2).   A concerted conformational change within each monomer then results in two [[Alpha helix|α-helical]] regions unwinding to form four [[amphipathic]] [[Beta sheet|β-strands]] that span the [[Cell membrane|membrane]] of the target cell.&lt;ref name="plumacpf"/&gt;  Like CDC's MACPF proteins are thus β-pore forming toxins that act like a molecular hole punch.

Other crystal structures for members of the MACPF superfamily can be found in RCSB: i.e., {{PDB2|3KK7}}, {{PDB2|3QOS}}, {{PDB2|3QQH}}, {{PDB2|3RD7}}, {{PDB2|3OJY}}

==Control of MACPF proteins==
Complement regulatory proteins such as [[CD59]] function as [[membrane attack complex|MAC]] inhibitors and prevent inappropriate activity of complement against self cells (Figure 3).  Biochemical studies have revealed the peptide sequences in C8α and C9 that bind to CD59.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Huang Y, Qiao F, Abagyan R, Hazard S, Tomlinson S |title=Defining the CD59-C9 binding interaction |journal=J. Biol. Chem. |volume=281 |issue=37 |pages=27398–404 |year=2006 |pmid=16844690 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M603690200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lockert DH, Kaufman KM, Chang CP, Hüsler T, Sodetz JM, Sims PJ |title=Identity of the segment of human complement C8 recognized by complement regulatory protein CD59 |journal=J.

It is therefore suggested that CD59 directly inhibits the MAC by interfering with conformational change in one of the membrane spanning regions.&lt;ref name="plumacpf"/&gt;

Other proteins that bind to the MAC include C8γ. This protein belongs to the [[lipocalin]] family and interacts with C8α. The binding site on C8α is known, however, the precise role of C8γ in the MAC remains to be understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Schreck SF, Plumb ME, Platteborze PL, etal |title=Expression and characterization of recombinant subunits of human complement component C8: further analysis of the function of C8 alpha and C8 gamma |journal=J.

==Role in human disease==
Deficiency of C9, or other components of the MAC results in an increased susceptibility to diseases caused by [[Gram negative|gram-negative]] bacteria such as [[meningococcal]] [[meningitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kira R, Ihara K, Takada H, Gondo K, Hara T |title=Nonsense mutation in exon 4 of human complement C9 gene is the major cause of Japanese complement C9 deficiency |journal=Hum.

When cells experience metabolic or environmental [[Stress (biology)|stresses]], mitochondrial fusion and [[mitochondrial fission|fission]] work to maintain functional mitochondria. An increase in fusion activity leads to mitochondrial elongation, whereas an increase in fission activity results in mitochondrial fragmentation.&lt;ref name=Chan2006&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chan | first1 = DC | year = 2006 | title = Mitochondrial fusion and fission in mammals | url = | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 22| pages = 79–99 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.22.010305.104638 | pmid = 16704336 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The components of this process can influence [[programmed cell death]] and lead to [[neurodegenerative disorder]]s such as [[Parkinson's disease]]. Such cell death can be caused by disruptions in the process of either fusion or fission.&lt;ref name=Youle2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Youle|first1=Richard J.|title=Mitochondrial Fission, Fusion, and Stress|journal=Science Magazine|date=31 August 2012|volume=337| issue =  6098|pages=1062–1065|doi=10.1126/science.1219855|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/337/6098/1062.full#ref-1|accessdate=23 November 2014|pmid=22936770|pmc=4762028}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The shapes of mitochondria in cells are continually changing via a combination of fission, fusion, and motility. Specifically, fusion assists in modifying stress by integrating the contents of slightly damaged mitochondria as a form of complementation. By enabling [[genetic complementation]], fusion of the mitochondria allows for two mitochondrial [[genome]]s with different defects within the same organelle to individually encode what the other lacks. In doing so, these mitochondrial genomes generate all of the necessary components for a functional mitochondrion.&lt;ref name="Hales2010" /&gt;

==With mitochondrial fission==

The combined effects of continuous fusion and fission give rise to mitochondrial networks. The mechanisms of mitochondrial fusion and fission are regulated by [[proteolysis]] and posttranslational modifications. The actions of fission, fusion and motility cause the shapes of these double membrane bound subcellular organelles we know as mitochondria to continually alter their shapes. 

The changes in balance between the rates of mitochondrial fission and fusion directly affect the wide range of mitochondrial lengths that can be observed in different cell types. Rapid fission and fusion of the mitochondria in cultured fibroblasts has been shown to promote the redistribution of mitochondrial [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) from one mitochondrion to all of the other mitochondria. This process can occur in a cell within a time period as short as an hour.&lt;ref name="Youle2012" /&gt;

The significance of mitochondrial fission and fusion is distinct for nonproliferating neurons, which are unable to survive without mitochondrial fission. Such nonproliferating neurons cause two human diseases known as [[Kjer's optic neuropathy|dominant optic atrophy]] and [[Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease|Charcot Marie Tooth disease]] type 2A, which are both caused by fusion defects. Though the importance of these processes is evident, it is still unclear why mitochondrial fission and fusion are necessary for nonproliferating cells.

==Regulation==

Many gene products that control mitochondrial fusion have been identified, and can be reduced to three core groups which also control mitochondrial fission. These groups of proteins include mitofusins, [[OPA1]]/Mgm1, and Drp1/[[DNM1|Dnm1]]. All of these molecules are GTP hydrolyzing proteins ([[GTPases]]) that belong to the [[dynamin]] family. Mitochondrial dynamics in different cells are understood by the way in which these proteins regulate and bind to each other.&lt;ref name=Hales2010/&gt; These GTPases in control of mitochondrial fusion are well conserved between mammals, flies, and yeast. Mitochondrial fusion mediators differ between the outer and inner membranes of the mitochondria. Specific membrane-anchored dynamin family members mediate fusion between mitochondrial outer membranes known as [[MFN1|Mfn1]] and [[MFN2|Mfn2]]. These two proteins are mitofusin contained within humans that can alter the morphology of affected mitochondria in over-expressed conditions. However, a single dynamin family member known as OPA1 in mammals mediates fusion between mitochondrial inner membranes. These regulating proteins of mitochondrial fusion are organism-dependent; therefore, in ''Drosophila'' (fruit flies) and yeasts, the process is controlled by the mitochondrial transmembrane GTPase, Fzo.  In ''Drosophila'', Fzo is found in postmeiotic spermatids and the dysfunction of this protein results in male sterility.  However, a deletion of Fzo1 in budding yeast results in smaller, spherical mitochondria due to the lack of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).

==Apoptosis==

The balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission in cells is dictated by the up-and-down regulation of mitofusins, OPA1/Mgm1, and Drp1/Dnm1. [[Apoptosis]], or [[programmed cell death]], begins with the breakdown of mitochondria into smaller pieces. This process results from up-regulation of Drp1/Dnm1 and down-regulation of mitofusins. Later in the apoptosis cycle, an alteration of OPA1/Mgm1 activity within the inner mitochondrial membrane occurs. The role of the OPA1 protein is to protect cells against apoptosis by inhibiting the release of [[cytochrome c]]. Once this protein is altered, there is a change in the cristae structure, release of cytochrome c, and the activation of the destructive caspase enzymes. These resulting changes indicate that inner mitochondrial membrane structure is linked with regulatory pathways in influencing cell life and death. OPA1 plays both a genetic and molecular role in mitochondrial fusion and in cristae remodeling during apoptosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frezza | first1 = C | last2 = Cipolat | first2 = S | last3 = Martins | first3 =  | last4 = de Brito | first4 = O | last5 = Micaroni | first5 = M | last6 = Benznoussenko | first6 = GV | last7 = Rudka | first7 = T | last8 = Bartoli | first8 = D | last9 = Polishuck | first9 = RS | last10 = Danial | first10 = NN | last11 = De Strooper | first11 = B | last12 = Scorrano | first12 = L | year = 2006 | title = OPA1 controls apoptotic cristae remodeling independently from mitochondrial fusion | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 126 | issue = 1| pages = 177–189 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2006.06.025 | pmid = 16839885 }}&lt;/ref&gt; OPA1 exists in two forms; the first being soluble and found in the intermembrane space, and the second as an integral inner membrane form, work together to restructure and shape the cristae during and after apoptosis. OPA1 blocks intramitochondrial cytochrome c redistribution which proceeds remodeling of the cristae.  OPA1 functions to protect cells with mitochondrial dysfunction due to Mfn deficiencies, doubly for those lacking Mfn1 and Mfn2, but it plays a greater role in cells with only Mfn1 deficiencies as opposed to Mfn2 deficiencies.  Therefore, it is supported that OPA1 function is dependent on the amount of Mfn1 present in the cell to promote mitochondrial elongation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cipolat | first1 = S | last2 = Martins | first2 =  | last3 = de Brito | first3 = O | last4 = Dal Zilio | first4 = B | last5 = Scorrano | first5 = L | year = 2004 | title = OPA1 requires mitofusin 1 to promote mitochondrial fusion | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 101 | issue = 45| pages = 15927–15932 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0407043101 | pmid = 15509649 | pmc=528769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In mammals==

Both proteins, Mfn1 and Mfn2, can act either together or separately during mitochondrial fusion.  Mfn1 and Mfn2 are 81% similar to each other and about 51% similar to the ''Drosophila'' protein Fzo.  Results published for a study to determine the impact of fusion on mitochondrial structure revealed that Mfn-deficient cells demonstrated either elongated cells (majority) or small, spherical cells upon observation.

The Mfn protein has three different methods of action:  Mfn1 homotypic [[oligomer]]s, Mfn2 homotypic oligomers and Mfn1-Mfn2 heterotypic oligomers.  It has been suggested that the type of cell determines the method of action but it has yet to be concluded whether or not Mfn1 and Mfn2 perform the same function in the process or if they are separate.  Cells lacking this protein are subject to severe cellular defects such as poor cell growth, heterogeneity of mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased [[cellular respiration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = H | last2 = Chomyn | first2 = A | last3 = Chan | first3 = DC | year = 2005 | title = Disruption of fusion results in mitochondrial heterogeneity and dysfunction | url = | journal = Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 280 | issue = 28| pages = 26185–26192 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M503062200 | pmid = 15899901 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitochondrial fusion plays an important role in the process of [[Embryogenesis|embroygenesis]], as shown through the Mfn1 and Mfn2 proteins. Using Mfn1 and Mfn2 [[gene knockout|knock-out]] mice, which die in utero at midgestation due to a placental deficiency, mitochondrial fusion was shown not to be essential for cell survival in vitro, but necessary for embryonic development and cell survival throughout later stages of development. Mfn1 Mfn2 double knock-out mice, which die even earlier in development, were distinguished from the "single" knock-out mice. Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) originated from the double knock-out mice, which do survive in culture even though there is a complete absence of fusion, but parts of their mitochondria show a reduced mitochondrial DNA ([[Mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]]) copy number and lose membrane potential. This series of events causes problems with [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) synthesis.

== The Mitochondrial Inner/Outer Membrane Fusion (MMF) Family ==
The Mitochondrial Inner/Outer Membrane Fusion (MMF) Family ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=9.B.25 TC# 9.B.25]) is a family of proteins that play a role in mitochondrial fusion events. This family belongs to the larger [[Mitochondrial carrier|Mitochondrial Carrier (MC) Superfamily]]. The dynamic nature of mitochondria is critical for function. Chen and Chan (2010) have discussed the molecular basis of mitochondrial fusion, its protective role in neurodegeneration, and its importance in cellular function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Physiological functions of mitochondrial fusion|journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date = 2010-07-01|issn = 1749-6632|pmid = 20649534|pages = 21–25|volume = 1201|doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05615.x|first = Hsiuchen|last = Chen|first2 = David C.|last2 = Chan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mammalian mitofusins Mfn1 and Mfn2, GTPases localized to the outer membrane, mediate outer-membrane fusion. OPA1, a GTPase associated with the inner membrane, mediates subsequent inner-membrane fusion. Mutations in Mfn2 or OPA1 cause [[Neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] diseases. Mitochondrial fusion enables content mixing within a mitochondrial population, thereby preventing permanent loss of essential components. Cells with reduced mitochondrial fusion show a subpopulation of mitochondria that lack mtDNA nucleoids. Such mtDNA defects lead to respiration-deficient mitochondria, and their accumulation in neurons leads to impaired outgrowth of cellular processes and consequent neurodegeneration.

=== Family members ===
A representative list of the proteins belonging to the MMF family is available in the [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=9.B.25.2 Transporter Classification Database].
* [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=9.B.25.1.1 9.B.25.1.1] - The mitochondrial inner/outer membrane fusion complex, Fzo/Mgm1/Ugo1. Only the Ugo1 protein is a member of the MC superfamily.
* [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=9.B.25.2.1 9.B.25.2.1] - The mammalian mitochondrial membrane fusion complex, Mitofusin 1 (Mfn1)/Mfn2/Optical Atrophy Protein 1 (OPA1) complex. This subfamily includes mitofusins 1 and 2.

=== Mitofusins: Mfn1 and Mfn2 ===
[[MFN1|Mfn1]] and [[MFN2|Mfn2]] ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=9.B.25.2.1 TC# 9.B.25.2.1]; [https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8IWA4 Q8IWA4] and [https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/O95140 O95140], respectively), in mammalian cells are required for mitochondrial fusion, Mfn1 and Mfn2 possess functional distinctions. For instance, the formation of tethered structures ''in vitro'' occurs more readily when mitochondria are isolated from cells overexpressing Mfn1 than Mfn2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mitofusin 1 and 2 play distinct roles in mitochondrial fusion reactions via GTPase activity|journal = Journal of Cell Science|date = 2004-12-15|issn = 0021-9533|pmid = 15572413|pages = 6535–6546|volume = 117|issue = Pt 26|doi = 10.1242/jcs.01565|first = Naotada|last = Ishihara|first2 = Yuka|last2 = Eura|first3 = Katsuyoshi|last3 = Mihara}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Mfn2 specifically has been shown to associate with Bax and Bak (Bcl-2 family, [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.a.21 TC#1.A.21]), resulting in altered Mfn2 activity, indicating that the mitofusins possess unique functional characteristics. Lipidic holes may open on opposing bilayers as intermediates, and fusion in cardiac [[myocyte]]s is coupled with outer mitochondrial membrane destabilization that is opportunistically employed during the  mitochondrial permeability transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mitofusins and the mitochondrial permeability transition: the potential downside of mitochondrial fusion|journal = American Journal of Physiology.

Mutations in Mfn2 (but not Mfn1) result in the neurological disorder [[Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease|Charcot-Marie-Tooth]] syndrome. These mutations can be complemented by the formation of Mfn1–Mfn2&lt;sup&gt;CMT2A&lt;/sup&gt; hetero-oligomers but not homo-oligomers of Mfn2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;–Mfn2&lt;sup&gt;CMT2A&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Complementation between mouse Mfn1 and Mfn2 protects mitochondrial fusion defects caused by CMT2A disease mutations|journal = The Journal of Cell Biology|date = 2007-02-12|issn = 0021-9525|pmc = 2063976|pmid = 17296794|pages = 405–414|volume = 176|issue = 4|doi = 10.1083/jcb.200611080|first = Scott A.|last = Detmer|first2 = David C.|last2 = Chan}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that within the Mfn1–Mfn2 hetero-oligomeric complex, each molecule is functionally distinct.  This suggests that control of the expression levels of each protein likely represents the most basic form of regulation to alter mitochondrial dynamics in mammalian tissues. Indeed, the expression levels of Mfn1 and Mfn2 vary according to cell or tissue type as does the mitochondrial morphology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Two mitofusin proteins, mammalian homologues of FZO, with distinct functions are both required for mitochondrial fusion|journal = Journal of Biochemistry|date = 2003-09-01|issn = 0021-924X|pmid = 14561718|pages = 333–344|volume = 134|issue = 3|first = Yuka|last = Eura|first2 = Naotada|last2 = Ishihara|first3 = Sadaki|last3 = Yokota|first4 = Katsuyoshi|last4 = Mihara|doi=10.1093/jb/mvg150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Yeast mitochondrial fusion proteins ===
In yeast, three proteins are essential for mitochondrial fusion. Fzo1 ([https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P38297 P38297]) and Mgm1 ([https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P32266 P32266]) are conserved guanosine triphosphatases that reside in the outer and inner membranes, respectively. At each membrane, these conserved proteins are required for the distinct steps of membrane tethering and lipid mixing. The third essential component is Ugo1, an outer membrane protein with a region homologous to but distantly related to a region in the Mitochondrial Carrier (MC) family. Hoppins ''et al.'', 2009 showed that Ugo1 is a modified member of this family, containing three transmembrane domains and existing as a dimer, a structure that is critical for the fusion function of Ugo1.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The molecular mechanism of mitochondrial fusion|journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta|date = 2009-01-01|issn = 0006-3002|pmid = 18691613|pages = 20–26|volume = 1793|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2008.07.005|first = Suzanne|last = Hoppins|first2 = Jodi|last2 = Nunnari}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their analyses of Ugo1 indicate that it is required for both outer and inner membrane fusion after membrane tethering, indicating that it operates at the lipid-mixing step of fusion. This role is distinct from the fusion dynamin-related proteins and thus demonstrates that at each membrane, a single fusion protein is not sufficient to drive the lipid-mixing step. Instead, this step requires a more complex assembly of proteins. The formation of a fusion pore has not yet been demonstrated.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mitochondrial outer and inner membrane fusion requires a modified carrier protein|journal = The Journal of Cell Biology|date = 2009-02-23|issn = 1540-8140|pmc = 2654124|pmid = 19237599|pages = 569–581|volume = 184|issue = 4|doi = 10.1083/jcb.200809099|first = Suzanne|last = Hoppins|first2 = Jennifer|last2 = Horner|first3 = Cheng|last3 = Song|first4 = J.

== Homology ==
[[Homologous protein|Homologues]] of the NicO family have differing predicted topologies: 6, 7 and 8 TMSs. One such homologue, RcnA (YohM; [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.113.1.1 TC# 2.A.113.1.1]) of ''E. coli'' (274 aas) has 6 putative transmembrane segments (TMSs) in a 3 + 3 arrangement with a large hydrophilic loop between putativeTMSs 3 and 4.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Several homologues of RcnA (e.g., RcnA homologue from ''[[Ralstonia solanacearum]]''; [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.113.1.3 TC# 2.A.113.1.3]; CAD17703) have 7 putative TMSs (4 + 3). Still another homologue, UreH of ''Methanocaldococcus janaschii'' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.113.1.4 TC# 2.A.113.1.4]) has 6 putative TMSs in a more characteristic 3 + 3 TMS arrangement. The NicO family within the [[Lysine Exporter|LysE superfamily]] may have a common origin with the [[TOG Superfamily|TOG superfamily]], having lost TMSs 1 and 4 in the 8 TMS TOG superfamily topology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Function ==
This protein is believed to catalyze Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; efflux.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal

The overall reaction catalyzed by proteins of the NicO family is probably:

[Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] (in) → [Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] (out).

The '''''p''-aminobenzoyl-glutamate transporter''' '''(AbgT) family''' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.68 TC# 2.A.68]) is a family of transporter proteins belonging to the [[Ion transporter|ion transporter (IT) superfamily]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prakash S, Cooper G, Singhi S, Saier MH | title = The ion transporter superfamily | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1618 | issue = 1 | pages = 79–92 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14643936 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbamem.2003.10.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rabus R, Jack DL, Kelly DJ, Saier MH | title = TRAP transporters: an ancient family of extracytoplasmic solute-receptor-dependent secondary active transporters | journal = Microbiology | volume = 145 ( Pt 12) | issue = 12 | pages = 3431–45 | date = December 1999 | pmid = 10627041 | doi = 10.1099/00221287-145-12-3431 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The AbgT family consists of the AbgT (YdaH; [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.68.1.1 TC# 2.A.68.1.1]) protein of ''E. coli'' and the MtrF drug exporter ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.68.1.2 TC# 2.A.68.1.2]) of ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hussein MJ, Green JM, Nichols BP | title = Characterization of mutations that allow p-aminobenzoyl-glutamate utilization by Escherichia coli | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 180 | issue = 23 | pages = 6260–8 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 9829935 | pmc = 107711 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Folster JP, Shafer WM | title = Regulation of mtrF expression in Neisseria gonorrhoeae and its role in high-level antimicrobial resistance | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 187 | issue = 11 | pages = 3713–20 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15901695 | pmc = 1112036 | doi = 10.1128/JB.187.11.3713-3720.2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The former protein is apparently cryptic in wild-type cells, but when expressed on a high copy number plasmid, or when expressed at higher levels due to mutation, it appeared to allow uptake (''K''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;123&amp;nbsp;nM; see [[Michaelis–Menten kinetics]]) and subsequent utilization of ''p''-aminobenzoyl-glutamate as a source of [[P aminobenzoate|''p''-aminobenzoate]] for ''p''-aminobenzoate [[Auxotrophy|auxotrophs]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carter EL, Jager L, Gardner L, Hall CC, Willis S, Green JM | title = Escherichia coli abg genes enable uptake and cleavage of the folate catabolite p-aminobenzoyl-glutamate | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 189 | issue = 9 | pages = 3329–34 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17307853 | pmc = 1855889 | doi = 10.1128/JB.01940-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''p''-Aminobenzoate is a constituent of and a precursor for the biosynthesis of [[folic acid]]. MtrF was annotated as a putative [[Efflux (microbiology)|drug efflux pump]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Structure ==
AbgT is 510 amino acyl residues long and has 12-13 putative transmembrane α-helical spanners (TMSs). MtrF is 522 aas long and has 11 or 12 putative TMSs. The 3-d structures of MtrF and a YdaH homologue have been solved, and functional studies show that it is a drug exporter.  The 3-d structure shows that it has 9 TMSs with hairpin entry loops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Su CC, Bolla JR, Kumar N, Radhakrishnan A, Long F, Delmar JA, Chou TH, Rajashankar KR, Shafer WM, Yu EW | title = Structure and function of Neisseria gonorrhoeae MtrF illuminates a class of antimetabolite efflux pumps | journal = Cell Reports | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–70 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25818299 | pmc = 4410016 | doi = 10.1016/j.celrep.2015.03.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crystal Structures:

== Genetics ==
The ''abgT'' gene is preceded by two genes, ''abgA'' and ''abgB,'' which code for homologous amino acyl amino hydrolases and hydrolyze ''p''-aminobenzoyl glutamate to ''p''-aminobenzoate and glutamate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Because of the structural similarity of ''p''-aminobenzoyl-glutatmate to peptides, and the enzymatic activities of the ''abgA'' and ''abgB'' gene products, it has been suggested that AbgT is also a peptide transporter.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Demonstration of an energy requirement suggested an H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent mechanism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Expression of these genes is regulated by AbgR and an unknown effector.

== Function ==
As noted above, the AbgT family of transporters has been thought to contribute to bacterial [[Folic acid|folate biosynthesis]] by importing the catabolite ''p''-aminobenzoyl-glutamate for producing folate. Approximately 13,000 putative family members were identified in 2015.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Delmar JA, Yu EW | title = The AbgT family: A novel class of antimetabolite transporters | journal = Protein Science | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 322–37 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26443496 | pmc = 4815354 | doi = 10.1002/pro.2820 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The X-ray structures of the full-length ''[[Alcanivorax borkumensis]]'' YdaH (AbgT) and ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]'' MtrF proteins. The structures revealed that these two transporters assemble as dimers with architectures distinct from all other families of transporters for which 3-d structures were available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bolla JR, Su CC, Delmar JA, Radhakrishnan A, Kumar N, Chou TH, Long F, Rajashankar KR, Yu EW | title = Crystal structure of the Alcanivorax borkumensis YdaH transporter reveals an unusual topology | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 6 | pages = 6874 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25892120 | pmc = 4410182 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms7874 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both YdaH and MtrF are bowl-shaped dimers with a solvent-filled basin extending from the cytoplasm halfway across the [[Lipid bilayer|membrane bilayer]]. The protomers of YdaH and MtrF contain nine transmembrane helices and two hairpins which suggested a plausible pathway for substrate transport.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A combination of the crystal structure, genetic analyses and substrate accumulation assays indicated that both YdaH and MtrF behave as exporters, capable of removing the folate metabolite ''p''-aminobenzoic acid from bacterial cells. In fact, it was shown that both YdaH and MtrF participate as [[Antibiotics|antibiotic]] efflux pumps, mediating bacterial resistance to [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide antimetabolite drugs]]. Possibly, many AbgT-family transporters act as exporters, conferring resistance to [[Sulfadiazine|sulfonamides]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Transport reaction ===
The generalized transport reaction initially proposed for AbgT is:&lt;blockquote&gt;''p''-aminobenzoyl-glutamate (out) + nH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) → ''p''-aminobenzoyl-glutamate (in) + nH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in)&lt;/blockquote&gt;but the more recently proposed transport reaction is:&lt;blockquote&gt;Sulfonamide drugs (in) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) → Sulfonamide drugs (out) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

2) Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-preferring, and

3) Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-preferring.

A representative list of proteins belonging to the CitMHS family can be found in the [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.11.2 Transporter Classification Database].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.a.11|title=2.A.11.

== CitM and CitH ==
Two of the characterized members of the CitMHS family, both [[Citric acid|citrate]] uptake permeases from ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'', are CitM ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.11.1.1 TC# 2.A.11.1.1]) and CitH ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.11.1.2 TC# 2.A.11.1.2])''.''

NhaB homologues are usually about 500 amino acyl residues (aas) in length and possess about 12 transmembrane α-helical spanners (TMSs), although some members differ in their number of TMSs. NhaB homologues also exhibit a region with limited sequence similarity to a 46 kDa membrane protein of unknown function from ''[[Mycobacterium leprae]]'' (spP46838) which is also homologous to a member of arsenate resistance pumps of bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=3.a.4 TC# 3.A.4]). Only [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] bacterial proteins have been functionally characterized.

The ''E. coli'' NhaB is 58% identical to the orthologous ''[[Vibrio alginolyticus]]'' Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiporter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pinner|first=E.|last2=Padan|first2=E.|last3=Schuldiner|first3=S.|date=1992-06-05|title=Cloning, sequencing, and expression of the nhaB gene, encoding a Na+/H+ antiporter in Escherichia coli|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=267|issue=16|pages=11064–11068|issn=0021-9258|pmid=1317851}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the latter protein is predicted to exhibit 10 TMSs, construction of ''NhaB-phoA'' fusions led to evidence for a 9 TMS model with the N-terminus in the cytoplasm and the C-terminus in the [[periplasm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Enomoto|first=H.|last2=Unemoto|first2=T.|last3=Nishibuchi|first3=M.|last4=Padan|first4=E.|last5=Nakamura|first5=T.|date=1998-03-06|title=Topological study of Vibrio alginolyticus NhaB Na+/H+ antiporter using gene fusions in Escherichia coli cells|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta|volume=1370|issue=1|pages=77–86|issn=0006-3002|pmid=9518558|doi=10.1016/s0005-2736(97)00245-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A centrally located aspartyl residue in the 3rd TMS is conserved in all members of the family and important for activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nakamura|first=T.|last2=Fujisaki|first2=Y.|last3=Enomoto|first3=H.|last4=Nakayama|first4=Y.|last5=Takabe|first5=T.|last6=Yamaguchi|first6=N.|last7=Uozumi|first7=N.|date=2001-10-01|title=Residue aspartate-147 from the third transmembrane region of Na(+)/H(+) antiporter NhaB of Vibrio alginolyticus plays a role in its activity|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|volume=183|issue=19|pages=5762–5767|doi=10.1128/JB.183.19.5762-5767.2001|issn=0021-9193|pmc=95471|pmid=11544242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' lacks such a homologue. ''[[Pyrococcus]]'' species also have at least one homologue each. Thus, members of the NhaC family are found in both [[Gram-negative bacteria]] and [[Gram-positive bacteria]] as well as archaea. NhaC of ''B. firmus'' is 462 amino acyl residues long and possesses 12 putative transmembrane α-helical segments. MleN of ''B. subtilis'' (468 aas; [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.35.1.2 TC# 2.A.35.1.2]) also exhibits 12 putative TMSs.

The transport reaction catalyzed by NhaC is probably:&lt;blockquote&gt;Na+ (in) + nH+ (out) ⇌ Na+ (out) + nH+ (in). (n &gt; 1)&lt;/blockquote&gt;That catalyzed by MleN is probably:&lt;blockquote&gt;Malate (out) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) + Lactate (in) + Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in) ⇌ Malate (in) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in) + Lactate (out) + Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Monovalent Cation:Proton Antiporter-1 (CPA1) Family''' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.36 TC# 2.A.36]) is a large family of proteins derived from [[Gram-positive bacteria|Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] bacteria, [[Cyanobacteria|blue-green bacteria]], [[archaea]], [[yeast]], [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s. The CPA1 family belongs to the VIC superfamily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chang AB, Lin R, Keith Studley W, Tran CV, Saier MH | title = Phylogeny as a guide to structure and function of membrane transport proteins | journal = Molecular Membrane Biology | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 171–81 | date = 2004-06-01 | pmid = 15204625 | doi = 10.1080/09687680410001720830 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Saier MH, Eng BH, Fard S, Garg J, Haggerty DA, Hutchinson WJ, Jack DL, Lai EC, Liu HJ, Nusinew DP, Omar AM, Pao SS, Paulsen IT, Quan JA, Sliwinski M, Tseng TT, Wachi S, Young GB | title = Phylogenetic characterization of novel transport protein families revealed by genome analyses | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1422 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–56 | date = February 1999 | pmid = 10082980 | doi = 10.1016/s0304-4157(98)00023-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transporters from eukaryotes have been functionally characterized to catalyze Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; exchange. Their primary physiological functions are thought to be in (1) cytoplasmic pH regulation, extruding the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; generated during metabolism, and (2) salt tolerance (in plants), due to Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake into vacuoles. Bacterial homologues have also been found to facilitate Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; [[Antiporter|antiport]], but some also catalyze Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiport or Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiport under certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Waditee R, Hibino T, Tanaka Y, Nakamura T, Incharoensakdi A, Takabe T | title = Halotolerant cyanobacterium Aphanothece halophytica contains an Na(+)/H(+) antiporter, homologous to eukaryotic ones, with novel ion specificity affected by C-terminal tail | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 276 | issue = 40 | pages = 36931–8 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11479290 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M103650200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phylogeny ==
The [[phylogenetic tree]] for the CPA1 family shows three principal clusters. The first cluster includes proteins derived exclusively from animals, and all of the functionally characterized members of the family belong to this cluster. Of the two remaining clusters, one includes all bacterial homologues while the other includes one from ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]],'' one from ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' and two from yeast (''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|S. cerevisiae]]'' and ''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe|S. pombe]]''). Several organisms possess multiple paralogues; for example, seven paralogues are found in ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]],'' and five are known in humans. Most of these paralogues are very similar in sequence, and they belong to the animal specific cluster.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A representative list of proteins belonging to the CPA1 family can be found in the [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.36.8 Transporter Classification Database].

== Structure ==
Numerous members of the CPA1 family have been sequenced, and these proteins vary substantially in size. The bacterial proteins have 520-550 amino acyl residues (aas) while eukaryotic proteins are generally larger, varying in size from 540-900 residues. They exhibit 10-12 putative transmembrane α-helical spanners (TMSs). A proposed [[Topology|topological]] model suggests that in addition to 12 TMSs, a region between TMSs 9 and 10 dips into the membrane to line the pore. However, one homologue, Nhx1 of ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|S. cerevisiae]]'' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.36.1.12 TC# 2.A.36.1.12])'','' has an extracellular glycosylated C-terminus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wakabayashi S, Pang T, Su X, Shigekawa M | title = A novel topology model of the human Na(+)/H(+) exchanger isoform 1 | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 275 | issue = 11 | pages = 7942–9 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10713111 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.275.11.7942 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wells KM, Rao R | title = The yeast Na+/H+ exchanger Nhx1 is an N-linked glycoprotein.

== Function ==
Using the mammalian NHE1 ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.36.1.1 TC# 2.A.36.1.1]), it has been found that TMSs 4 and 9 as well as the extracellular loop between TMSs 3 and 4 are important for drug ([[amiloride]]- and [[benzoyl]] [[Guanidine|guanidinium]]-based derivatives) sensitivities. Mutations in these regions also affect transport activities. M4 and M9 therefore contain critical sites for both drug and [[cation]] recognition.

The CPA3 family consists of bacterial multicomponent K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; [[antiporter]]s. The best characterized systems are the PhaABCDEFG system of ''[[Sinorhizobium meliloti]]'' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.63.1.1 TC# 2.A.63.1.1]) that functions in pH adaptation and as a K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; efflux system, and the MnhABCDEFG system of ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.63.1.3 TC# 2.A.63.1.3]) that functions as a Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; efflux Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiporter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.63|title=2.A.63 The Monovalent Cation (K+ or Na+):Proton Antiporter-3 (CPA3) Family|website=Transporter Classification Databse|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Homology ==
A homologous, but only partially sequenced, system was earlier reported to catalyze Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiport in an alkalophilic ''[[Bacillus]]'' strain. PhaA and PhaD are respectively homologous to the ND5 and ND4 subunits of the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-pumping [[NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase]] ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=3.d.1 TC #3.D.1]). Homologous protein subunits from ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' NADH:quinone oxidoreductase can functionally replace MrpA and MrpD in ''[[Bacillus subtilis]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moparthi VK, Kumar B, Mathiesen C, Hägerhäll C | title = Homologous protein subunits from Escherichia coli NADH:quinone oxidoreductase can functionally replace MrpA and MrpD in Bacillus subtilis | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1807 | issue = 4 | pages = 427–36 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21236240 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbabio.2011.01.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homologues of PhaA, B, C and D and Nha1, 2, 3 and 4 of an alkalophilic ''Bacillus'' strain are the Yuf(Mrp)T, U, V and D genes of ''Bacillus subtilis''. In this system, YufT is believed to be responsible for Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiporter activity, but it does not have activity in the absence of other constituents of the operon.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kosono S, Morotomi S, Kitada M, Kudo T | title = Analyses of a Bacillus subtilis homologue of the Na+/H+ antiporter gene which is important for pH homeostasis of alkaliphilic Bacillus sp.

== Structure ==
The seven Pha proteins are of the following sizes (in #aas) and exhibit the following putative numbers of transmembrane α-helical spanners (TMSs): 
* PhaA - 725 and 17
* PhaB - 257 and 5
* PhaC - 115 and 3 
* PhaD - 547 and 13 
* PhaE - 161 and 3 
* PhaF - 92 and 3 
* PhaG - 120 and 3 
All are predicted to be integral membrane proteins.

Corresponding values for the ''[[Staphylococcus aureus|S. aureus]]'' Mnh system are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hiramatsu T, Kodama K, Kuroda T, Mizushima T, Tsuchiya T | title = A putative multisubunit Na+/H+ antiporter from Staphylococcus aureus | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 180 | issue = 24 | pages = 6642–8 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 9852009 | pmc = 107768 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* MnhA - 801 and 18 
* MnhB - 142 and 4
* MnhC - 113 and 3 
* MnhD - 498 and 13
* MnhE - 159 and 4
* MnhF - 97 and 3 
* MnhG - 118 and 3 
In view of the complexity of the system, large variation in subunit structure, and the homology with NDH family protein constituents, a complicated energy coupling mechanism, possibly involving a redox reaction, cannot be ruled out.

== Function ==
Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; does, but K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; do not, support significant [[Antiporter|antiport]] by the [[Gram-positive bacteria]]l systems (TC# 2.A.6.3.1.2 and TC# 2.A.6.3.1.3).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Swartz TH, Ito M, Ohira T, Natsui S, Hicks DB, Krulwich TA | title = Catalytic properties of Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus members of the secondary cation/proton antiporter-3 (Mrp) family are revealed by an optimized assay in an Escherichia coli host | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 189 | issue = 8 | pages = 3081–90 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17293423 | pmc = 1855852 | doi = 10.1128/JB.00021-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiporters have alkaline pH optima and apparent K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; values for Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; that are among the lowest reported for bacterial Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiporters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2902">In [[comparative genomics]], a '''sequence graph''', also called an '''alignment graph''', '''breakpoint graph''', or '''adjacency graph''', is a [[bidirected graph]] in which the vertices represent segments of [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] and the edges represent adjacency between segments in a genome. &lt;ref&gt;Alekseyev, Max A., and Pavel A. Pevzner. “Breakpoint Graphs and Ancestral Genome Reconstructions.” Genome Research 19.5 (2009): 943–957. PMC. Web. 20 Mar. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The segments are labeled by the DNA string they represent, and each edge connects the tail end of one segment with the head end of another segment. Each adjacency edge is labelled by a (possibly empty) string of DNA. Traversing a connected component of segments and adjacency edges (called a ''thread'') yields a sequence, which typically represents a genome or a section of a genome. The segments can be thought of as synteny blocks, with the edges dictating how to arrange these blocks in a particular genome, and the labelling of the adjacency edges representing bases that are not contained in synteny blocks. 

==Applications==
===Multiple sequence alignment===
Sequence graphs can be used to represent [[multiple sequence alignment|multiple sequence alignments]] with the addition of a new kind of edge representing [[homology (biology)|homology]] between segments. &lt;ref&gt;Paten B, Zerbino DR, Hickey G, Haussler D. A unifying model of genome evolution under parsimony. BMC Bioinformatics. 2014;15:206. doi:10.1186/1471-2105-15-206. &lt;/ref&gt; For a set of genomes, one can create an acyclic breakpoint graph with a thread for each genome. For two segments &lt;math&gt;(a, b)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(c,d)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; represent the endpoints of the two segments, homology edges can be created from &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; or from &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; - representing the two possible orientations of the homology. The advantage of representing a multiple sequence alignment this way is that it is possible to include inversions and other structural rearrangements that wouldn't be allowable in a matrix representation.
===Representing variation===
If there are multiple possible paths when traversing a thread in a sequence graph, multiple sequences can be represented by the same thread. This means it is possible to create a sequence graph that represents a population of individuals with slightly different genomes - with each genome corresponding to one path through the graph. These graphs have been proposed as a replacement for the reference human genome. &lt;ref&gt;Paten, B., Novak, A., Haussler, D. 2014, arXiv:1404.5010&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-translocating pyrophosphatase family}}
Members of the '''H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-translocating Pyrophosphatase (M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''-PPase)'' Family''' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=3.a.10 TC# 3.A.10]) are found in the vacuolar ([[Vacuole|tonoplast]]) membranes of higher plants, [[algae]], and [[protozoa]], and in both bacteria and [[archaea]]. They are therefore ancient enzymes.

== Classification ==
Full-length members of the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPase family have been sequenced from numerous bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. These H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; pumping enzymes, which are probably homodimeric, have been reported to fall into two phylogenetic subfamilies.&lt;ref name="Belogurov_2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Belogurov GA, Turkina MV, Penttinen A, Huopalahti S, Baykov AA, Lahti R | title = H+-pyrophosphatase of Rhodospirillum rubrum.

Those from respiratory and photosynthetic bacteria as well as archaea are less dependent upon K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. However, exceptions may exist.&lt;ref name="Belogurov_2002" /&gt; It is not sure whether K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is transported.

The archaeon, ''[[Methanosarcina]]'' ''mazei'' Gö1, encodes within its genome two H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-translocating [[pyrophosphatase]]s (PPases), Mvp1 and Mvp2. Mvp1 resembles bacterial PPases while Mvp2 resembles plant PPases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bäumer S, Lentes S, Gottschalk G, Deppenmeier U | title = Identification and analysis of proton-translocating pyrophosphatases in the methanogenic archaeon Methansarcina mazei | journal = Archaea | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–7 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 15803653 | pmc = 2685546 | doi = 10.1155/2002/371325 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mvp2 was shown to translocate 1 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; per pyrophosphate hydrolyzed.

Some PPases from ''[[Anaerostipes caccae]]'', ''Chlorobium limicola'', ''[[Clostridium tetani]]'', and ''[[Desulfuromonas acetoxidans]]'' have been identified as K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transporters.&lt;ref name="Luoto_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luoto HH, Belogurov GA, Baykov AA, Lahti R, Malinen AM | title = Na+-translocating membrane pyrophosphatases are widespread in the microbial world and evolutionarily precede H+-translocating pyrophosphatases | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 286 | issue = 24 | pages = 21633–42 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21527638 | pmc = 3283130 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M111.244483 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phylogenetic analysis led to the identification of a monophyletic clade comprising characterized and predicted Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-transporting PPases (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPases) within the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent subfamily. H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-transporting PPases (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPases) are more heterogeneous and form at least three independent clades in both subfamilies.&lt;ref name="Luoto_2011" /&gt;

== Function ==
The plant enzymes probably pump one H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; upon hydrolysis of pyrophosphate, thereby generating a [[proton motive force]], positive and acidic in the tonoplast lumen. They establish a pmf of similar magnitude to that generated by the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-translocating ATPases in the same vacuolar membrane. The bacterial and archaeal proteins may catalyze fully reversible reactions, thus being able to synthesize pyrophosphate when the pmf is sufficient. The enzyme from ''R. rubrum'' contributes to the pmf when light intensity is insufficient to generate a pmf sufficient in magnitude to support rapid ATP synthesis. Both C-termini of the [[Protein dimer|dimeric]] subunits of V-PPase are on the same side of the membrane, and they are close to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu TH, Hsu SH, Huang YT, Lin SM, Huang TW, Chuang TH, Fan SK, Fu CC, Tseng FG, Pan RL | title = The proximity between C-termini of dimeric vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase determined using atomic force microscopy and a gold nanoparticle technique | journal = The FEBS Journal | volume = 276 | issue = 16 | pages = 4381–94 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19614743 | doi = 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07146.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transmembrane domain 6 of vacuolar H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-[[pyrophosphatase]] appears to mediate both protein targeting and proton transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pan YJ, Lee CH, Hsu SH, Huang YT, Lee CH, Liu TH, Chen YW, Lin SM, Pan RL | title = The transmembrane domain 6 of vacuolar H(+)-pyrophosphatase mediates protein targeting and proton transport | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1807 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–67 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 20937245 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbabio.2010.10.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The generalized transport reaction catalyzed by H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPases is:&lt;blockquote&gt;pyrophosphate (P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (cytoplasm) → inorganic phosphate (2 P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (external milieu or vacuolar lumen).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Structure ==
Eukaryotic members of the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPase family are large proteins of about 770 amino acyl residues (aas) with fifteen or sixteen putative transmembrane α-helical spanners (TMSs). The N-termini are predicted to be in the vacuolar lumen while the C-termini are thought to be in the cytoplasm. These proteins exhibit a region that shows convincing sequence similarity to the regions surrounding the DCCD-sensitive glutamate in the C-terminal regions of the c-subunits of F-type ATPases ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=3.A.2 TC #3.A.2]). The H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-pyrophosphatase of ''[[Streptomyces coelicolor]]'' has been shown to have a 17 TMS topology with the substrate binding domain exposed to the cytoplasm. The C-terminus is hydrophilic with a single C-terminal TMS. The basic structure is believed to have 16 TMSs with several large cytoplasmic loops containing functional motifs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mimura H, Nakanishi Y, Hirono M, Maeshima M | title = Membrane topology of the H+-pyrophosphatase of Streptomyces coelicolor determined by cysteine-scanning mutagenesis | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 279 | issue = 33 | pages = 35106–12 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15187077 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M406264200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several acidic residues in the ''[[Arabidopsis]]'' H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPase have been shown to be important for function. Some plants possess closely related H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPase isoforms. These enzymes have the enzyme commission number [[EC 3.6.1.1]].

(2012) reported the crystal structure of a ''[[Vigna radiata]]'' H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPase (VrH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPase) in complex with a non-hydrolysable substrate analogue, imidodiphosphate (IDP), at 2.35 Å resolution.

A previously undescribed proton translocation pathway is formed by six core transmembrane helices. Proton pumping can be initialized by PP(i) hydrolysis, and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is then transported into the vacuolar lumen through a pathway consisting of Arg 242, Asp 294, Lys 742 and Glu 301. Lin et al. (2012) proposed a working model of the mechanism for the coupling between proton pumping and PP(i) hydrolysis by H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPases.

'''Sessility''' is the [[biology|biological]] property of an [[organism]] describing its lack of a means of self-locomotion.  Absent natural ''[[motility]]'' sessile organisms are normally immobile. This is distinct from the [[sessility (botany)|botanical]] meaning of sessility, which refers to an organism or biological structure attached directly by its base without a stalk.

Sessile organisms can move via external forces (such as water currents), but are usually permanently attached to something. Organisms such as [[coral]]s lay down their own [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] from which they grow.  Other sessile organisms grow from a solid such as a rock, dead tree trunk, or a manmade object such as a buoy or ship's hull.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=Biology of the Invertebrates|last=Pechenik|first=Jan|date=2016|ISBN=9781497006515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobility==
Sessile animals typically have a motile phase in their development. [[Sponge]]s have a motile [[larval]] stage, which becomes sessile at maturity. In contrast, many [[jellyfish]] develop as sessile [[polyp]]s early in their life cycle. In the case of the [[cochineal]], it is in the nymph stage (also called the crawler stage) that the cochineal disperses. The juveniles move to a feeding spot and produce long wax filaments. Later they move to the edge of the cactus pad where the wind catches the wax filaments and carries the tiny larval cochineals to a new host.

==Reproduction==
Many sessile animals, including sponges, [[coral]]s and [[hydra (genus)|hydra]], are capable of [[asexual reproduction]] ''[[in situ]]'' by the process of [[budding]].  Sessile organisms such as [[barnacle]]s and [[tunicate]]s need some mechanism to move their young into new territory. This is why the most widely accepted theory explaining the [[evolution]] of a [[larva]]l stage is the need for long-distance dispersal ability. Biologist [[Wayne Sousa]]'s 1979 study in intertidal disturbance added support for the theory of nonequilibrium community structure, “suggesting that open space is necessary for the maintenance of diversity in most communities of sessile organisms.”&lt;ref&gt;WP. Ecology. 1979. Disturbance in Marine Intertidal Boulder Fields: The Nonequilibrium maintenance of species diversity. http://bio.classes.ucsc.edu/bio170/Readings/sousa%201979.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clumping==
{{Main Article|Clumping (biology)}}
[[File:Blue mussel clump.jpg|thumb|280px|Blue mussels, ''[[Mytilus edulis]]'', are sessile and exhibit clumping]]

'''Clumping''' is a behavior in sessile organisms, in which individuals of a particular species group closely to one another for beneficial purposes, and can be seen in [[coral reef]]s and cochineal populations. This allows for faster reproduction and better protection from predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecology and Classification of North American Freshwater Invertebrates|author=James H. Thorp|author2=Alan P. Covich |publisher=[[Academic Press]]|page=213|date=2001|isbn=0-12-690647-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aj2ZMSekmHEC&amp;dq=Sessile+Limnology&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predominance in coastal environments==
The [[littoral zone|circalittoral zone]] of [[coast]]al environments and [[biome]]s are dominated by sessile organisms such as [[oyster]]s. [[Carbonate platform]]s grow due to the buildup of skeletal remains of sessile organisms, usually [[microorganism]]s, which induce carbonate precipitation through their metabolism.

==Botanical sessility==
In anatomy and botany, ''sessility'' refers to an organism or biological structure that has no ''peduncle'' or stalk. See [[peduncle (anatomy)]], [[peduncle (botany)]] and [[sessility (botany)]]. A sessile structure has no stalk.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7824">'''Phylogenetic inertia''' or phylogenetic constraint refers to the limitations on the future [[evolution]]ary pathways that have been imposed by previous [[adaptation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=K|last2=McKinney|first2=F|last3=Sorenson|first3=M|date=1999|title=Phylogenetic constraint on male parental care in the dabbling ducks.|url=|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B|volume=266|issue=1421|pages=759–763|doi=10.1098/rspb.1999.0702|pmid=|pmc=1689901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Darwin]] first recognized this phenomenon, though the term was later coined by Huber in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huber|first=B|date=1939|title=Siebrohrensystem unserer Baume und seine jahreszeitlichen Veranderungen.|url=|journal=Jahrbücher für Wissenschaftliche Botanik|volume=88|pages=176–242|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin explained the idea of phylogenetic inertia based on his observations; he spoke about it when explaining the "Law of Conditions of Existence".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Darwin also suggested that, after [[speciation]], the [[organism]]s do not start over from scratch, but have characteristics that are built upon already existing ones that were inherited from their ancestors; and these characteristics likely limit the amount of evolution seen in that new [[Taxon|taxa]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shanahan|first=Timothy|date=2011|title=Phylogenetic Inertia and Darwin's Higher Law|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49816525|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the main concept of phylogenetic inertia.

[[Richard Dawkins]] also explained these constraints by likening [[natural selection]] to a river in his 1982 book ''[[The Extended Phenotype]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Extended Phenotype: The Gene as a Unit of Selection|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1982|isbn=|location=|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of phylogenetic inertia ==

=== Body plan ===

*[[File:Fishapod evolution.jpg|alt=Sown here is a cladogram of the best known transitional fossils. From bottom to top: Eusthenopteron, Panderichthys, Tiktaalik, Acanthostega, Ichthyostega, Pederpes.|thumb|229x229px|Evolution of fish to tetrapods.  The basic body plan has been phylogenetically constrained.]]Most terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s have a [[body plan]] that consist of four limbs. The phylogenetic inertia hypothesis suggests that this body plan is observed, not because it happens to be optimal, but because [[Evolution of tetrapods|tetrapods]] are derived from a [[clade]] of [[fish]]es ([[Sarcopterygii]]) which also have four limbs. Four limbs happened to be suitable means of locomotion, and so this body plan has not been selected against.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewin|first=Roger|date=1980|title=Evolutionary Theory Under Fire|url=|journal=Science|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Human]]s do not have optimal structure for [[bipedalism]], because much of the human body plan originally evolved under [[Quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]] locomotion, and has since been constrained because of phylogenetic inertia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gould|first=S. J.|last2=Lewontin|first2=R. C.|date=1979-09-21|title=The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/205/1161/581|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|volume=205|issue=1161|pages=581–598|doi=10.1098/rspb.1979.0086|issn=0962-8452|pmid=42062|bibcode=1979RSPSB.205..581G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modes of reproduction ===

[[Bird]]s are the only speciose group of vertebrates that are exclusively [[Oviparity|oviparous]], or egg laying. It has been suggested that birds are phylogenetically constrained, as being derived from [[reptile]]s, and likely have not overcome this constraint or diverged far enough away to develop [[viviparity]], or live birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKitrick|first=Mary|date=1993|title=Phylogenetic Constraint in Evolutionary Theory: Has it any Explanatory Power?|url=|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|volume=24|pages=307–330|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.24.110193.001515}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blackburn|first=Daniel|last2=Evans|first2=Howard|date=1986|title=Why are there no Viviparous Birds?|url=|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=128|issue=2|pages=165–190|doi=10.1086/284552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Homologous structures ===

* More specifically than the similarity in body plan, there are [[homology (biology)|homologous]] bones across [[mammal]]ian taxa. For example, the [[pentadactyl limb]] bone structure observed in the arms of [[primate]]s, front legs of equestrians, in the wings of [[bat]]s, and the flippers of [[Seal (animal)|seals]]. The fact that they are homologous is further evidence for phylogenetic inertia; these structures have been modified over time, but they are constrained by common ancestry.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Origin of Species|last=Darwin|first=Charles|publisher=|year=1859|isbn=|location=|pages=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Homology vertebrates-en.svg|thumb|Homologous bone structure in forelimbs of four vertebrates.|159x159px]]
* All vertebrates share a homologous eye structure that effectively have a [[Blind spot (vision)|blind spot]] in them where the [[optic nerve]] attaches to the [[retina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Blind Watchmaker|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=|year=1986|isbn=978-0-393-31570-7|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tests for phylogenetic inertia in study systems ==
There have been several studies that have been able to effectively test for phylogenetic inertia when looking into shared traits; predominantly with a comparative methods approach.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diniz-Filho|first=Jose Alexandre Felizola|last2=Sant'Ana|first2=Carlos Eduardo Ramos de|last3=Bini|first3=Luis Mauricio|date=1998-01-01|title=An Eigenvector Method for Estimating Phylogenetic Inertia|jstor=2411294|journal=Evolution|volume=52|issue=5|pages=1247–1262|doi=10.2307/2411294|pmid=28565378}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pienaar|first=Jason|last2=Ilany|first2=Amiyaal|last3=Geffen|first3=Eli|last4=Yom-Tov|first4=Yoram|date=2013-05-01|title=Macroevolution of life-history traits in passerine birds: adaptation and phylogenetic inertia|journal=Ecology Letters|volume=16|issue=5|pages=571–576|doi=10.1111/ele.12077|pmid=23489254|issn=1461-0248}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morales|first=Eduardo|date=2000-04-01|title=Estimating Phylogenetic Inertia in Tithonia (asteraceae): A Comparative Approach|journal=Evolution|volume=54|issue=2|pages=475–484|doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2000.tb00050.x|issn=1558-5646}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have used comparative methods and found evidence for certain traits attributed to adaptation, and some to phylogeny; there were also numerous traits that could be attributed to both.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Another study developed a new method of comparative examination that showed to be a powerful predictor of phylogenetic inertia in a variety of situations. It was called Phylogenetic [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|Eigenvector]] Regression (PVR), which runs [[Principal component analysis|principal component analyses]] between species on a pairwise [[Distance matrices in phylogeny|phylogenetic distance matrix]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In another, different study, the authors described methods for measuring phylogenetic inertia, looked at effectiveness of various comparative methods, and found that different methods can reveal different aspects of drivers. [[Autoregression]] and PVR showed good results with morphological traits.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The EMBO Journal, 30(22), 4523–4538. http://doi.org/10.1038/emboj.2011.326&lt;/ref&gt; Variant a of the protein also contains a hydrophobic stretch of alanine from 567 to 574 and a mixed charge sequence from residue 598 to 617.&lt;ref name="sdsc.edu"/&gt; FAM63B protein may contain a signal sequence specifying return to the endoplasmic reticulum (KDEL) from residue 607 to 621 in variant a.

==== Secondary Structure ====
The secondary structure of FAM63B is a combination of coils, some [[α-helices]], and few [[β-sheets]].&lt;ref name="sdsc.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ic.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2/phyre2_output/af64ab84316a975b/summary.html|title=Phyre 2 Results for Undefined|work=ic.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/|title=I-TASSER server for protein structure and function prediction|work=umich.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Phyre 2 program predicts α-helices in 23% of the protein, β-strands in 9% of the protein, and the remaining 59% of the protein as disordered.&lt;ref name="ic.ac.uk"/&gt; The disordered regions coincide with the coiled regions predicted by other programs, and this results in the long stretch of coiled protein beginning at the N-terminus. According to the SOUSI program, there is a 16-amino acid-long span from residues 265 to 280 of FAM63B that could be a transmembrane sequence.&lt;ref name="expasy.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expasy.org/proteomics/post-translational_modification|title=ExPASy: SIB Bioinformatics Resource Portal - Categories|work=expasy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, transmembrane sequences generally need to be at least 20 amino acids long in order to be stable in the membrane, so a transmembrane sequence is unlikely. Therefore, FAM63B is not fixed in the membrane of any organelle and is free to move through the cell and between organelles.

==== Tertiary Structure ====
Not much is known about the tertiary structure of FAM63B. A predicted folding is shown.

=== Subcellular Location ===
FAM63B has predicted NES ([[nuclear export signals]]) at Val274 and Leu277.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/cgi-bin/webface2.fcgi?jobid=5716AACA000019874EC1B1F0&amp;wait=20|title=5716AACA000019874EC1B1F0 expired|work=dtu.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a NLS ([[nuclear localization signal]]) is predicted for FAM63B at RKRK at residue 599.&lt;ref name="expasy.org" /&gt; In agreement, Reinhardt's method for cytoplasmic/nuclear discrimination predicts FAM63B to be located in the nucleus with a reliability of 76.7%. The presence of both NLS and NES signals and [[O-GlcNAc]] post-translational modification of FAM63B supports the protein's location in both the nucleus and cytoplasm and the discovered protein function as a shuttle for vaccinia virus between the nucleus and the cell periphery.

== Expression ==

=== Expression Level ===
FAM63B has moderately-high to high expression and is constitutively expressed. FAM63B is likely [[ubiquitously]] expressed in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/clust.cgi?UGID=2060133&amp;TAXID=9606&amp;SEARCH=FAM63B|title=Family with sequence similarity 63, member B (FAM63B)|work=nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differential Expression ===
Expression of FAM63B is high in the embryonic stem cells and differentiated tissues but low or off in [[Embryoid body|embryoid bodies]] and other [[Progenitor cell|progenitor]] cells, such as the [[multipotent]] [[mesenchymal stem cells]]. It is likely that FAM63B is expressed during [[pluripotency]] and [[unipotency]] but is not important for differentiation, as is occurring in embryoid bodies, mesenchymal stem cells, and other progenitor cells.

=== Regulation of Expression ===

==== Transcriptional Regulation ====
The promoter of FAM63B is GXP_5885, located on the positive strand of chromosome 15 from (58770692, 58771462) and is 711 base pairs long.&lt;ref name="genomatix.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genomatix.de/cgi-bin//eldorado/eldorado.pl?s=40f88fb88bb64f3f83263645b98dcf85;SHOW_ANNOTATION=FAM63B;ELDORADO_VERSION=E30R1410|title=Genomatix: Annotation &amp; Analysis|work=genomatix.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interacting Proteins ==
FAM63B is shown to interact with one protein, [[KLC1|KLC-1]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Dodding, M. P., Mitter, R., Humphries, A. C., &amp; Way, M. (2011). A kinesin-1 binding motif in vaccinia virus that is widespread throughout the human genome. The EMBO Journal, 30(22), 4523–4538. http://doi.org/10.1038/emboj.2011.326&lt;/ref&gt; KLC-1, kinesin light chain 1, is a protein which recruits kinesin-1 via its cargo binding light chain and contains a bipartite tryptophan binding motif.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; This motif is present in a vaccinia virus integral membrane protein, A36, that is required for transport of the virus from the perinuclear space to the cell periphery.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In the absence of A36, proteins with a bipartite tryptophan binding motif can interact with the kinesin light chain, recruit KLC-1, and promote virus transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Function ==
The discovered function of FAM63B protein is a transporter of vaccinia virus in the human genome. FAM63B contains a bipartite tryptophan binding motif between W476 and W533.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The motif also contains a [[Glutamine|Q residue]] at the +2 position, which was found to be a frequent occurrence in proteins that bind KLC-1 or KLC-2.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; FAM63B is among proteins studied that can rescue virus transport to the cell periphery when expressed in A36-deficient cells, successfully replacing the cytoplasmic domain A36 of vaccinia.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Clinical Significance ==

=== Pathology ===
The specific pathology of FAM63B is unknown.

=== Disease Association ===
FAM63B is part of four networks regulated by miRNA, three of which are linked to neuronal differentiation and [[dopaminergic]] gene expression.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Aberg, K. A., et al. (2014). Methylome-Wide Association Study of Schizophrenia. JAMA Psychiatry, 71(3), 255–264. http://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2013.3730&lt;/ref&gt; These findings indicate that FAM63B could be used as a biomarker for the detection and treatment of [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Furthermore, aberrant methylation of FAM63B may play a role in the development of schizophrenia.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; FAM63B has also been ranked 13 of 25 on a list of associated genes relevant to [[arthritis]].&lt;ref&gt;Li, C., et al. (2008). A systematic method for mapping multiple loci: An application to construct a genetic network for rheumatoid arthritis. Gene, 408(1–2), 104–111. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2007.10.028&lt;/ref&gt;

== Homology ==

=== Paralogs ===
FAM63B has one paralog, [[FAM63A]], which is a gene of unknown function. FAM63A gene encodes a protein that is 469 amino acids long and 76% similar to FAM63B.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/55793|title=FAM63A family with sequence similarity 63 member A [Homo sapiens (human)] - Gene - NCBI|work=nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Orthologs ===
FAM63B has been found in all multicellular and unicellular eukaryotes, including plants but excluding protists and fungi. The gene has also been found in archaea but not bacteria.&lt;ref name="nih.gov1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi|title=BLAST: Basic Local Alignment Search Tool|work=nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distant Homologs ===
The most distant homolog of FAM63B is found in ''Thermoplasmatales archaeon'', an [[archaea]] that diverged from the human gene 4.25 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="nih.gov1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timetree.org/search/pairwise/9606/215775?|title=TimeTree|work=timetree.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Homologous Domains ===
FAM63B is a member of the Pfam super family, and contains a domain of unknown function (DUF544) homologous within the protein family.&lt;ref name="nih.gov1"/&gt; This region of the protein is highly conserved through FAM63B homologs, as is the bipartite tryptophan binding motif of FAM63B and the C-terminus signal sequence.

=== Phylogeny ===
The phylogenetic tree below shows a time calibration for the evolution of FAM63B.
[[File:FAM63B phylogenic tree.jpg|thumb|none|The phylogenetic tree from TimeTree shows a time calibration for the evolution of FAM63B among humans (Has), prairie voles (Moc), polar bears (Uma), Western clawed frogs (Xtr), and Western Indian Ocean coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae, Lch). The fish is the most diverged, followed by the amphibian, and the mammals, especially humans, are the least diverged. This is as expected in accordance with the evolutionary history of organisms on Earth, and FAM63B shows no great exception to the rule.]]

A '''Merodiploid''' is a partially diploid bacterium, which has its own [[chromosome]] complement and a chromosome fragment introduced by [[Conjugation (acid-base theory)|conjugation]], transformation or [[transduction (genetics)|transduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=merodiploid|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/merodiploid|journal=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be defined as an essentially haploid [[organism]] that carries a second copy of a part of its genome. The term is derived from the Greek, meros = part, and was originally used to describe both unstable partial diploidy, such as that which occurs briefly in recipients after mating with an Hfr strain (1), and the stable state, exemplified by F-prime strains (see Hfr'S And F-Primes). Over time the usage has tended to confine the term to descriptions of stable genetic states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://what-when-how.com/molecular-biology/merodiploids-molecular-biology/|title=Merodiploids (Molecular Biology)|website=What-when-how.com|accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Merodiploidy''' refers to the partial duplication of chromosomes in a haploid organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Natural Genetic Transformation Generates a Population of Merodiploids in Streptococcus pneumoniae|first1=Calum |last1= Johnston |first2=Stéphanie |last2=Caymaris |first3=Aldert |last3=Zomer|first4=Hester J. |last4=Bootsma|first5=Marc |last5=Prudhomme|first6=Chantal |last6=Granadel|first7= Peter W.

A '''biological rule''' or '''biological law''' is a generalized [[law (science)|law]], [[principle]], or [[rule of thumb]] formulated to describe patterns observed in living organisms. Biological rules and laws are often developed as succinct, broadly applicable ways to explain complex phenomena or salient observations about the [[ecology]] and [[biogeography|biogeographical]] distributions of plant and animal [[species]] around the world, though they have been proposed for or extended to all types of organisms. Many of these regularities of ecology and biogeography are named after the biologists who first described them.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jørgensen |first1=Sven Erik |title=Explanation of ecological rules and observation by application of ecosystem theory and ecological models|journal=Ecological Modelling |volume=158 |issue=3 |year=2002 |pages=241–248 |doi=10.1016/S0304-3800(02)00236-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Allee |first=W.C. |last2=Schmidt |first2=K.P. |date=1951 |title=Ecological Animal Geography |edition=2nd |pages=457, 460–472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the birth of their science, biologists have sought to explain apparent regularities in observational data. In [[Aristotle's biology|his biology]], [[Aristotle]] inferred rules governing differences between live-bearing [[tetrapod]]s (in modern terms, terrestrial placental [[mammal]]s). Among his rules were that [[brood size]] decreases with adult body mass, while [[life expectancy|lifespan]] increases with [[gestation period]] and with body mass, and [[fecundity]] decreases with lifespan. Thus, for example, elephants have smaller and fewer broods than mice, but longer lifespan and gestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leroi |first=Armand Marie |authorlink=Armand Marie Leroi |title=The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science |titlelink=Aristotle's Lagoon |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=2014 |isbn=978-1-4088-3622-4 |page=408}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rules like these concisely organized the sum of knowledge obtained by early scientific measurements of the natural world, and could be used as [[scientific model|models]] to predict future observations. Among the earliest biological rules in modern times are those of [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] (from 1828 onwards) on [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]],&lt;ref name=Lovtrup/&gt; and of [[Constantin Wilhelm Lambert Gloger]] on animal pigmentation, in 1833.&lt;ref name=Gloger/&gt;
There is some [[scepticism]] among biogeographers about the usefulness of general rules. For example, J.C. Briggs, in his 1987 book ''Biogeography and Plate Tectonics'', comments that while [[Willi Hennig]]'s rules on [[cladistics]] "have generally been helpful", his progression rule is "suspect".&lt;ref name="Briggs1987"&gt;{{cite book |last=Briggs |first=J.C. |title=Biogeography and Plate Tectonics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vCNG2e5K-YgC&amp;pg=PA11 |year=1987 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-08-086851-6 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Allen's rule]]''' states that the body shapes and proportions of endotherms vary by climatic temperature by either minimizing exposed surface area to minimize heat loss in cold climates or maximizing exposed surface area to maximize heat loss in hot climates. It is named after [[Joel Asaph Allen]] who described it in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Joel Asaph |last=Allen |title=The influence of Physical conditions in the genesis of species |journal=Radical Review |year=1877 |volume=1 |pages=108–140 |url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/biogeog/ALLE1877.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Barry Holstun |last=Lopez |year=1986 |title=Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape |publisher=Scribner |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y-WxJYMD5HsC |isbn=978-0-684-18578-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HUMARA Assay''' is one of the most widely used methods to determine the clonal origin of a tumor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parsons|first=Barbara L.|date=2008-10-01|title=Many different tumor types have polyclonal tumor origin: evidence and implications|journal=Mutation Research|volume=659|issue=3|pages=232–247|doi=10.1016/j.mrrev.2008.05.004|issn=0027-5107|pmid=18614394}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Comertpay|first=Sabahattin|last2=Pastorino|first2=Sandra|last3=Tanji|first3=Mika|last4=Mezzapelle|first4=Rosanna|last5=Strianese|first5=Oriana|last6=Napolitano|first6=Andrea|last7=Baumann|first7=Francine|last8=Weigel|first8=Tracey|last9=Friedberg|first9=Joseph|date=2014-01-01|title=Evaluation of clonal origin of malignant mesothelioma|journal=Journal of Translational Medicine|volume=12|pages=301|doi=10.1186/s12967-014-0301-3|issn=1479-5876|pmc=4255423|pmid=25471750}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method is based on [[X chromosome inactivation]] and it takes the advantage of having different [[methylation]] status of a gene called HUMARA (short for Human [[Androgen receptor]]) that is located on [[X chromosome]]. Considering the fact that once one X chromosome is inactivated in a cell,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gartler|first=S. M.|last2=Riggs|first2=A. D.|date=1983-01-01|title=Mammalian X-chromosome inactivation|journal=Annual Review of Genetics|volume=17|pages=155–190|doi=10.1146/annurev.ge.17.120183.001103|issn=0066-4197|pmid=6364959}}&lt;/ref&gt; all other cells derived from it will have the same X chromosome inactivated, this approach becomes a great tool to differentiate a monoclonal population from a polyclonal  one in a female tissue. HUMARA gene, in particular, has three important features that make it highly convenient for the purpose.

1-) The gene is located on X chromosome and it goes through inactivation by methylation in normal [[embryogenesis]] of a female infant.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The fact that most-but not all-genes on X chromosome undergo inactivation, this feature becomes an important one.

2-) Human Androgen Receptor gene [[allele]]s have varying numbers of CAG repeats.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=R. C.|last2=Zoghbi|first2=H. Y.|last3=Moseley|first3=A. B.|last4=Rosenblatt|first4=H. M.|last5=Belmont|first5=J. W.|date=1992-12-01|title=Methylation of HpaII and HhaI sites near the polymorphic CAG repeat in the human androgen-receptor gene correlates with X chromosome inactivation|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=51|issue=6|pages=1229–1239|issn=0002-9297|pmc=1682906|pmid=1281384}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when [[DNA]] from a healthy female tissue is amplified by [[PCR]] for a specific region of the gene, two separated bands can be seen on the gel.

3-) The region that is amplified by PCR also has certain base orders that make it susceptible to be digested by [[HpaII]] (or HhaI) enzyme when it is not methylated.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This detail gives the opportunity to researchers to differentiate a methylated allele from the unmethylated one.

Thanks to these qualities of HUMARA gene, clonal origin of any tissue from a female mammalian organism can be determined.

The basic process is performed as the following :

1-) DNA from the tissue is isolated.

2-) The isolated DNA is treated with the suitable enzyme (such as HpaII) in optimal conditions for a suggested amount of time (i.e. overnight).

3-) DNA is cleaned and the certain region of HUMARA gene is amplified by PCR using "suitable" primers (as an example, please see:Ref.2)

4-) After running PCR products through a gel, the gel is visualized and the results are analyzed accordingly. If two bands are apparent, the tissue studied is most likely of polyclonal origin. If a single band is observed, the tissue is monoclonal unless two alleles have exactly the same numbers of CAG repeats or different cells with the same inactivated initiated the tumor; so, seemingly monoclonal although it is actually polyclonal.

In order to make a conclusion about the clonality of a tumor, it is best to use the DNA from a normal tissue of the same person, and a sample without enzyme treatment must also be amplified as a control. If, even in normal tissues without enzyme treatment, a single band is observed, it may be explained as follows; this person has the genetic pattern as XO (this possibility can be excluded to see a band after enzyme treatment because, if indeed XO is the genetic pattern of the sample, then, there will be NO methylation, therefore no band should be visible after digesting with the enzyme. In the case of seeing a band after enzyme treatment, the observation is most likely to mean that the person has two X chromosomes with exact CAG repeats.) When you see two bands for normal tissue (both enzyme treated and untreated), and you see two bands for enzyme treated tumor sample but two bands for untreated tumor DNA, then you are surely looking at a polyclonal tumor. However, if you see the same number of bands only with a single band after enzyme treatment, there is a rather high chance for the tumor of your interest to be monoclonal. In this last case, monoclonality is not for sure because, as stated earlier, there is the possibility of having exact same -CAG- repeats on both alleles.

Beta-adrenergic agonists, or  β-agonists, are non-hormonal growth promotants that help animals put on muscle instead of fat. Ractopamine (brand names include Optaflexx and Paylean) and zilpaterol (brand name Zilmax) received FDA approval in 1999 and 2003, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beta-agonists: What are they and should I be concerned?|url=http://newsroom.unl.edu/announce/beef/2563/14863|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also approved in Mexico, South Africa, and Canada. 160 countries restrict the importation of beef which has been raised with β-agonists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beta agonists in cattle debate beefs up|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-11-01/beta-agonist-debate/5063004|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temple Grandin was one of the first to describe the potential problems with the supplement. Cattle may arrive at the plant with a stiff gait, acting like they have both stiff muscles and sore feet. The problem could be muscle fatigue. Zilpateral enhances the growth of “fast-twitch” fibers, a type of muscle fiber that fatigues more easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Temple Grandin Explains Animal Welfare Problems With Beta-Agonists|url=http://www.beefmagazine.com/processors/temple-grandin-explains-animal-welfare-problems-beta-agonists|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 16, 2013 Merck and Co., the makers of Zilmax, suspended the sale of the product in the US and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Use of Beta-Agonists in Cattle Feed|url=http://extension.psu.edu/animals/beef/nutrition/articles/use-of-beta-agonists-in-cattle-feed|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; But problems may exist with all β-agonists supplementation, and not just for animals.

==Introduction==
The family of β-agonists includes β1-, β2-, and β3-agonists such as clenbuterol, ractopamine, cimaterol, zilpaterol and salbutamol. They possess similar chemical structures with different substituent groups on the phenyl ethanolamines. Due to their significant nutrition redistribution function, β-agonists have been applied in the livestock industry such as pigs and ruminants to reduce carcass fat and increase muscle mass while improving growth rate and feed conversion (Bareille and Faverdin, 1996, Bergen et al., 1989, Byrem et al., 1998, Cardoso and Taveira, 2002, Shook et al., 2009 and Williams et al., 1987). Unfortunately, β-agonists deposited in animal tissues can cause acute poisoning when consumed by humans, particularly in people with symptoms of muscular tremors, cardiac palpitation, nervousness, headache, muscular pain, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, fever and chills (Brambilla et al., 2000). Therefore, the use of β-agonists in animal feeds has been banned in many countries such as the EU and China (Mitchell and Dunnavan, 1998 and Prezelj et al., 2003). There are still illicit usages of β-agonists in animal feeds in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814615009966 | doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.06.104 | volume=192 | title=Broad screening and identification of β-agonists in feed and animal body fluid and tissues using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry combined with spectra library search | journal=Food Chemistry | pages=188–196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broad screening and identification of β-agonists in feed, serum, urine, muscle and liver samples was achieved in a quick and highly sensitive manner using ultra high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS) combined with a spectra library search. Solid-phase extraction technology was employed for sample purification and enrichment. After extraction and purification, the samples were analyzed using a Q-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometer under full-scan and data-dependent MS/MS mode. The acquired mass spectra were compared with an in-house library (compound library and MS/MS mass spectral library) built with TraceFinder Software which contained the M/Z of the precursor ion, chemical formula, retention time, character fragment ions and the entire MS/MS spectra of 32 β-agonist standards. Screening was achieved by comparing 5 key mass spectral results and positive matches were marked. Using the developed method, the identification results from 10 spiked samples and 238 actual samples indicated that only 2% of acquired mass spectra produced false identities. The method validation results showed that the limit of detection ranged from 0.021–3.854 μg kg−1and 0.015–1.198&amp;nbsp;ng mL−1 for solid and liquid samples, respectively.

The '''Lorquin Entomological Society''' is a century-old association of professional and amateur entomologists, biologists and naturalists that meet regularly to study and promote entomology and natural history, especially about wildlife in and near Southern California.

==History==
The '''Lorquin Natural History Club''' was started in June 1913 by [[Fordyce Grinnell Jr.]] A constitution committee was formed in July, and a constitution adopted at the August meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c8jm2bvs/admin/ |title=Finding aid to the Fordyce Grinnell, Jr. Papers MS.202 |website=Online Archive of California}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lorquiniaSep1916"&gt;{{cite journal |date=September 1916 |title=The Lorquin Natural History Club |url=https://archive.org/details/lorquinia112619161918lorq |journal=Lorquinia |volume=1 |issue=2 |publisher=Lorquin Natural History Club |pages=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named after French entomologist [[Pierre Joseph Michel Lorquin]], who collected specimens in California during the [[California Gold Rush]].&lt;ref name="lat13Sep2013"&gt;{{cite news |last=Balukjian |first=Brad |date=13 September 2013 |title=A grounded view of the empire of insects |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-sci-lorquin-20130915-story.html |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early members included not only entomologists like Grinnell, but herpetologists, botanists, an ornithologist, a conchologist, a geologist, and seismologist [[Charles F. Richter]], whose specialty at the time was astronomy.&lt;ref name="lat13Sep2013" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1916 |title=Cover |url=https://archive.org/details/lorquinia112619161918lorq |journal=Lorquinia |volume=1 |issue=1 |publisher=Lorquin Natural History Club |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="richter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oralhistories.library.caltech.edu/17/1/OH_Richter_C.pdf |title=Interview with Charles F.

The group was renamed the '''Lorquin Entomological Club''' in 1917 and its meetings moved to the [[Los Angeles Public Library]]. In 1919 the club began meeting in the [[Southwest Museum]] in [[Highland Park, Los Angeles|Highland Park]].&lt;ref name="Martin1972"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=Lloyd M. |date=October 20, 1972 |title=John Adams Comstock, 1883-1970 |url=https://archive.org/stream/bulletin7073sout#page/n218/mode/1up |journal=Bulletin |publisher=Southern California Academy of Sciences |volume=71 |issue=2 |pages=57–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early club activities included field trips into the hills and canyons beyond the termini of the Red Cars of the [[Pacific Electric]] and the Yellow Cars of the [[Los Angeles Railway]].&lt;ref name="richter" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1916 |title=In the Santa Susanna Mountains |url=https://archive.org/details/lorquinia112619161918lorq |journal=Lorquinia |volume=1 |issue=1 |publisher=Lorquin Natural History Club |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1916 |title=Announcements |url=https://archive.org/details/lorquinia112619161918lorq |journal=Lorquinia |volume=1 |issue=1 |publisher=Lorquin Natural History Club |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an era when a butterfly collector could net over 500 in a single day and take over 100 species in the Los Angeles area.&lt;ref name="Drummond1990"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Drummond |first=Boyce A. |date=1990 |title=Review of ''Butterflies of California'' reprint |url=http://images.peabody.yale.edu/lepsoc/jls/1990s/1990/1990-44(3)206-Drummond.pdf |journal=Journal of the Lepidopterists' Society |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=206–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club held their first Butterfly Show February 24–26, 1921, at the Southwest Museum. Among other things it featured a lecture on butterfly hunting, illustrated by [[stereopticon]] slides, by museum director [[John Adams Comstock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1921 |title=Unique Exhibit to be Given |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GjAdAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA536 |journal=Los Angeles School Journal |volume=5 |pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Butterfly Show became an annual, month-long event, sponsored by the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County|Museum of History, Science, and Art]].&lt;ref name="EvansHogue2004"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Arthur V. |last2=Hogue |first2=James N. |date=2004 |title=Introduction to California Beetles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8e_zG9ujZ60C&amp;pg=PA10 |publisher=University of California Press  |pages=10–11 |isbn=978-0-520-24035-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, the Southwest Museum narrowed its scope. Natural history exhibits and specimens were transferred to the Museum of History, Science, and Art.&lt;ref name="Martin1972" /&gt; In January 1927, the club moved its meetings there as well, and changed its name to the Lorquin Entomological Society.&lt;ref name="lat13Sep2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin1972" /&gt; Comstock, who had been director of the Southwest Museum from 1921 to 1926, published his landmark ''Butterflies of California'' in 1927. Early in 1928 he became Acting Director of the Museum of History, Science, and Art.&lt;ref name="Martin1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Drummond1990" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bigham |first=Will |date=February 5, 2005 |title=This Room is Bugged |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-11026149.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120005513/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-11026149.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 20, 2018 |newspaper=Whittier Daily News |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served several terms as president of the society. Under his influence, and that of his colleague Charles Montagu Dammers, the society's emphasis evolved from collecting to life history studies. Members in the late 1920s and early 1930s included biologists John Shrader Garth, Jeane Daniel Gunder, Lloyd M. Martin, and [[Don Meadows]].&lt;ref name="GarthTilden1986"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Garth |first1=John Shrader |last2=Tilden |first2=James Wilson |date=1986 |title=California Butterflies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KhGC9dO3jNsC&amp;pg=PA47 |publisher=University of California Press |pages=47–48 |isbn=978-0-520-05249-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, the society decided that California should name a state insect. They prepared ballots listing three butterfly candidates and sent them to entomologists throughout the state. The nominees were the [[Lorquin's admiral]] (''Limenitis lorquini''), the [[Heterochroa californica|California sister]] (''Heterochroa californica''), and the [[Zerene eurydice|California dog head]] or Flying pansy (''Zerene eurydice''). The California dog head won handily, with 77 votes out of 88 cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Berenbaum |first=May R. |date=1 April 1993 |title='Politically Correct' Insects |url=http://ae.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/2/68 |journal=American Entomologist |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=68–69 |doi=10.1093/ae/39.2.68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Garvey |first=Kathy Keatley |date=July 22, 2007 |title=Tracking the 'Dogface' |url=http://www.dailydemocrat.com/article/ZZ/20070722/NEWS/707229769 |newspaper=[[Daily Democrat]] |location=Woodland, California}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state legislature took note, and the Bureau of Entomology in the California Department of Agriculture began to use a likeness of the California dog head, labeled "California State Insect" on its documents. No further action took place, however, until 1972, when Assemblyman [[Kenneth L. Maddy]] introduced Assembly Bill No. 1843 to make what was by then known as the California dogface the official state insect. Governor [[Ronald Reagan]] signed the bill into law on July 28, 1972, making California the first in the nation to have a state insect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netstate.com/states/symb/insects/ca_insect.htm |title=California State Insect |website=netstate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, [[Steven R. Kutcher]], a member of the society, organized the first annual Insect Fair at the [[Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden]]. It featured exhibits by the society and others, demonstrations, and lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pool |first=Bob |date=March 23, 1991 |title=Insect Aficionados Show and Tell at Arboretum |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-03-23/local/me-541_1_insect-fair |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the fair outgrew the Arboretum, it was moved in 1989 to the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County (the erstwhile Museum of History, Science, and Art). Eventually the Natural History Museum took over organizing the fair and has done so since.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} What is now known as Bug Fair, and bills itself as "the biggest bug festival in North America", draws 20,000 visitors to its interactive exhibits, vendor tables, and insect menus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ng  |first=David |date=May 13, 2009 |title=Tarantula tempura?

The society has counted as members many academics, authors, and museum curators in the field of entomology, such as brothers John F. and Thomas C. Emmel, Cristopher Henne, [[Charles L. Hogue]] and son James N. 'Jim' Hogue, Noel McFarland, and Rudolf H. T. Mattioni.&lt;ref name="GarthTilden1986" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lorquinentomological.weebly.com/ |title=Home |website=Lorquin Entomological Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members are active in research, environmental protection, habitat restoration, species surveys, entomological outreach, and natural history education. As of 2013, membership stood at just over 100. Regular meetings with speakers are held on the fourth Friday of every month, at BioQuip (a biological supply house in Rancho Dominguez)&lt;ref name="lat13Sep2013" /&gt; since remodeling ousted the society from the Natural History Museum in 2009.

==Publications==
The club published eighteen monthly issues of ''Lorquinia'' between August 1916 and January 1919. They contained botanical and entomological papers and notes. Since about 1955, it has published a newsletter (10 issues per year),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=dos Passos |first=Cyril F. |date=1981 |title=Some Little-Known U.S. Publications of Lepidoptera II |url=http://lepidopteraresearchfoundation.org/journals/20/PDF20/20-111.pdf |journal=Journal of Research on the Lepidoptera |volume=20 |issue=2 |publisher= |pages=116–117 |issn=0022-4324}}&lt;/ref&gt; most recently called ''NetWork''. In 1999, it published a book by Robert Lee Allen, ''Stalking the wild arthropod: The Lorquin Entomological Society's guide to photographing arthropods''.

'''Biostasis''' is the ability of an [[organism]] to tolerate environmental changes without having to actively adapt to them. Biostasis is found in organisms that live in habitats that likely encounter unfavorable living conditions, such as drought, freezing temperatures, change in pH levels, pressure, or temperature. Insects undergo a type of dormancy to survive these conditions, called [[diapause]]. Diapause may be obligatory for these insects to survive. The insect may also be able to undergo change prior to the arrival of the initiating event.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.iwu.edu/~tardisdp/tardigrade_facts.html | title=Tardigrade Facts | author=Karen Lindahl and Susie Balser | date=2 October 1999 | publisher=Illinois Wesleyan University | access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biostasis is also used as a synonym for the terms [[Cryopreservation|cryostasis]] or [[cryonics]]. Cryonics is a  medical procedure concept that is a well established trope in [[Suspended animation in fiction|Science Fiction]], that may at some point in the future become a possible option for individuals who are terminally ill. The patients would be frozen in what is known as cryonic suspension. The patients are frozen so that when technology advances both to enable them to be unfrozen and brought back to life but also for their illness to be treated, they can be re-animated and their disease can be cured or treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merkle|first=R.C.|date=September 1992|title=The technical feasibility of cryonics|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030698779290133W|journal=Medical Hypotheses|volume=39|issue=1|pages=6–16|doi=10.1016/0306-9877(92)90133-w|pmid=1435395}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable medical source|date=November 2017}}

==Microorganisms==
Biostasis is also synonymous for '''viable but nonculturable state'''. In the past{{when|date=December 2018}} when bacteria were no longer growing on culture media it was assumed that they were dead. Now we can understand that there are many instances where bacteria cells may go into biostasis or suspended animation, fail to grow on media, and on resuscitation are again culturable. It should be noted that VBNC state differs from 'starvation survival state' (where a cell just reduces metabolism significantly). Bacteria cells may enter the VBNC state as a result of some outside stressor such as "starvation, incubation outside the temperature range of growth, elevated osmotic concentrations (seawater), oxygen concentrations, or exposure to white light" (9). Any of these instances could very easily mean death for the bacteria if it was not able to enter this state of dormancy. It has also been observed that in may instances where it was thought that bacteria had been destroyed (pasteurization of milk) and later caused spoilage or harmful effects to consumers because the bacteria had entered the VBNC state.

Effects on cells entering the VBNC state include "dwarfing, changes in metabolic activity, reduced nutrient transport, respiration rates and macromolecular synthesis". (9) Yet biosynthesis continues, and shock proteins are made. Most importantly has been observed that ATP levels and generation remain high, completely contrary to dying cells which show rapid decreases in generation and retention. Changes to the cell walls of bacteria in the VBNC state have also been observed. In E.coli a large amount of cross-linking was observed in the peptidoglycan. The autolytic capability was also observed to be much higher in VBNC cells than those who where in the growth state.

It should be noted that is far easier to induce bacteria to the VBNC state and once bacteria cells have entered the VBNC state it is very hard to return them to a culturable state. "They examined nonculturability and resuscitation in &lt;u&gt;Legionella Pneumophila&lt;/u&gt; and while entry into this state was easily induced by nutrient starvation, resuscitation could only be demonstrated following co-incubation of the VBNC cells with the amoeba, &lt;u&gt;Acanthamoeba Castellani&lt;/u&gt;" (9)

'''Fugistasis''' or mycostasis a naturally occurring VBNC (viable but nonculturable) state found in fungi in soil. Watson and Ford defined fungistasis as "when viable fungal propagules, which are not subject to endogenous or constitutive dormancy do not germinate in soil at their favorable temperature or moisture conditions or growth of fungal hyphae is retarded or terminated by conditions of the soil environment other than temperature or moisture." (10). Essentially (and mostly observed naturally occurring in soil) several types of fungi have been found to enter the VBNC state resulting from outside stressors (temperature, available nutrients, oxygen availability ect.) or from no observable stressors at all.

== Current research ==
On March 1, 2018, the [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) announced their new Biostasis program under the direction of Dr. Tristan McClure-Begley. The aim of the Biostasis program is to develop new possibilities for extending the [[Golden hour (medicine)|golden hour]] in patients who suffered a traumatic injury by slowing down the human body at the cellular level, addressing the need for additional time in continuously operating biological systems faced with catastrophic, life-threatening events. By leveraging molecular biology, the program aims to control the speed at which living systems operate and figure out a way to "slow life to save life."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2018-03-01|title=Slowing Biological Time to Extend the Golden Hour for Lifesaving Treatment|website=www.darpa.mil|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 20, 2018, the Biostasis team held a [[Webinar]] which, along with a [[Broad Agency Announcement]] (BAA), solicited five-year research proposals from outside organizations. The full proposals were due on May 22, 2018.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.darpa.mil/attachments/Biostasis%20Webinar_Full%20Deck_For%20Posting.pdf|title=Rapid Threat Assessment (RTA)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.darpa.mil|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Possible approaches ===
In their [[Web conferencing|Webinar]], [[DARPA]] outlined a number of possible research approaches for the Biostasis project. These approaches are based on research into [[diapause]] in [[tardigrade]]s and [[wood frog]]s which suggests that selective stabilization of intracellular machinery occurs at the [[protein]] level.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Protein chaperoning ====
In molecular biology, [[Chaperone (protein)|molecular chaperones]] are proteins that assist in the folding, unfolding, assembly, or disassembly of other [[Macromolecule|macromolecular]] structures. Under typical conditions, [[Chaperone (protein)|molecular chaperones]] facilitate changes in shape ([[conformational change]]) of [[macromolecule]]s in response to changes in environmental factors like [[temperature]], [[pH]], and [[voltage]]. By reducing conformational flexibility, scientists can constrain the function of certain proteins.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Recent research has shown that proteins are promiscuous, or able to do jobs in addition to the ones they evolved to carry out.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencealert.com/the-apromiscuousa-protein|title=The 'Promiscuous' Protein|last=University|first=Massey|work=ScienceAlert|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, protein promiscuity plays a key role in the adaptation of species to new environments.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is possible that finding a way to control [[conformational change]] in promiscuous proteins could allow scientists to induce biostasis in living organisms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Intracellular crowding ====
The crowdedness of cells is a critical aspect of biological systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/10/how-intracellular-crowding-changes-everything/|title=How Intracellular Crowding Changes Everything|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intracellular crowding refers to the fact that protein function and interaction with water is constrained when the interior of the cell is overcrowded.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Intracellular [[organelle]]s are either membrane-bound vesicles or membrane-less compartments that compartmentalize the cell and enable [[Spatiotemporal pattern|spatiotemporal]] control of biological reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brangwynne|first=Clifford P.|last2=Tompa|first2=Peter|last3=Pappu|first3=Rohit V.|date=2015-11-03|title=Polymer physics of intracellular phase transitions|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys3532|journal=Nature Physics|language=En|volume=11|issue=11|pages=899–904|doi=10.1038/nphys3532|issn=1745-2473|bibcode=2015NatPh..11..899B}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By introducing these intracellular [[polymer]]s to a biological system and manipulating the crowdedness of a cell, scientists may be able to slow down the rate of biological reactions in the system.

==== Tardigrade-disordered proteins ====
[[Tardigrade]]s are [[Micro-animal|microscopic animals]] that are able to enter a state of [[diapause]] and survive a remarkable array of environmental stressors, including [[freezing]] and [[desiccation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Research has shown that [[intrinsically disordered proteins]] in these organisms may work to stabilize cell function and protect against these extreme environmental stressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boothby|first=Thomas C.|last2=Tapia|first2=Hugo|last3=Brozena|first3=Alexandra H.|last4=Piszkiewicz|first4=Samantha|last5=Smith|first5=Austin E.|last6=Giovannini|first6=Ilaria|last7=Rebecchi|first7=Lorena|last8=Pielak|first8=Gary J.|last9=Koshland|first9=Doug|date=2017|title=Tardigrades Use Intrinsically Disordered Proteins to Survive Desiccation|url=https://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/fulltext/S1097-2765(17)30133-8|journal=Molecular Cell|language=English|volume=65|issue=6|pages=975–984.e5|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2017.02.018|pmid=28306513|pmc=5987194|issn=1097-2765|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By using [[peptide]] engineering, it is possible that scientists may be able to introduce [[intrinsically disordered proteins]] to the biological systems of larger animal organisms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This could allow larger animals to enter a state of biostasis similar to that of [[tardigrade]]s under extreme biological stress.

'''''Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches''''' is a book on human [[kinship]] and social behavior by Maximilian Holland, published in 2012. The work synthesizes the perspectives of [[evolutionary biology]], [[psychology]] and [[sociocultural anthropology]] towards understanding human social bonding and cooperative behavior. It presents a theoretical treatment that many consider to have resolved longstanding questions about the proper place of genetic (or 'blood') connections in human kinship and social relations, and a synthesis that ''"should inspire more nuanced ventures in applying Darwinian approaches to sociocultural anthropology"''.&lt;ref name="amazon.com"&gt;Philip Kitcher comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been called ''"A landmark in the field of evolutionary biology"''&lt;ref name=AV2014&gt;{{cite journal | first = Augusto | last = Vitale | title = Review of ''Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship'' | journal = Folia Primatologica | volume = 85 | year = 2014 | pages = 215 | url = http://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/365178}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ''"gets to the heart of the matter concerning the contentious relationship between kinship categories, genetic relatedness and the prediction of behavior"'',&lt;ref name=RF2012&gt;Robin Fox comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt; ''"places genetic determinism in the correct perspective"''&lt;ref name=AV2014 /&gt; and serves as ''"a shining example of what can be achieved when excellent scholars engage fully across disciplinary boundaries."''&lt;ref name=SS2015&gt;{{cite journal | first = Stuart | last = Semple| title = Review of: Holland, M (2012) Social bonding and nurture kinship: compatibility between cultural and biological approaches. | journal = Acta Ethologica | volume = 19| year = 2016| pages = 101–102| doi = 10.1007/s10211-015-0225-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of the book is to show that ''"properly interpreted,  cultural anthropology approaches (and ethnographic data)  and biological approaches are perfectly compatible regarding processes of social bonding in humans."''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Pages 283-284&lt;/ref&gt; Holland's position is based on demonstrating that the dominant biological theory of social behavior ([[inclusive fitness]] theory) is typically misunderstood to predict that genetic ties are necessary for the ''expression'' of social behaviors, whereas in fact the theory only implicates genetic associations as necessary for the ''evolution'' of social behaviors. Whilst rigorous evolutionary biologists have long understood the distinction between these levels of analysis (see [[Tinbergen's four questions]]), past attempts to apply inclusive fitness theory to humans have often overlooked the distinction between ''evolution'' and ''expression''.&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond its central argument, the broader philosophical implications of Holland's work are considered by commentators to be that it both ''"helps to untangle a long-standing disciplinary muddle"''&lt;ref name="RF2012"/&gt; and ''"clarifies the relationship between biological and sociocultural approaches to human kinship."''&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Hrdy comment (book description), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt;  It is claimed that the book ''"demonstrates that an alternative non-deterministic interpretation of evolutionary biology is more compatible with actual human social behavior and with the frameworks that sociocultural anthropology employs"''&lt;ref&gt;Kirk Endicott comment (book description), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt; and as a consequence, delivers ''"a convincing, solid and informed blow to the residual genetic determinism that still influences the interpretation of social behaviour."''&lt;ref name=AV2014 /&gt;

==Synopsis==

The book's form consists of a cumulative argument (using a wide range of supporting evidence) made over nine chapters, with each chapter ending in a brief retrospective summary, and the final chapter containing a recapitulation and summary of the whole,&lt;ref&gt;This synopsis is based mainly on the book's chapter summaries and concluding chapter&lt;/ref&gt; and drawing some wider conclusions.

===Continuing debate over 'blood kinship'===
{{See also|Kinship}}

Holland begins by tracing transitions in the history of anthropological theories of social behavior and [[kinship]], noting the varying importance with which 'blood ties' have been understood to be a necessary element of human kinship and social relations. He suggests that whilst the mounting [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] evidence has led to a move away from the 'blood kinship' concept in recent decades, many sociocultural anthropologists still query the connection between kinship and blood, reproduction or some other apparently biological functions. Meanwhile, many biologists, [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologists]] and [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] have persisted in viewing human kinship and cooperative behavior as necessarily associated with genetic relationships and 'blood ties'. The current situation has been characterized as "''a clash between incommensurate paradigms, holding as they may, completely incompatible ideas about human nature.''"&lt;ref&gt;Philip Thomas comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt; Holland argues that a clear resolution to these questions is still outstanding, and would therefore be of value. In closing the introduction, Holland writes; "The approach  is not reductive. The claim is rather that a thorough investigation of the ‘biological facts’ can be useful mainly though allowing a change in focus... away from confusion about the place of genealogy in social ties, and onto a reformulated baseline, built around varied ''processual aspects of social bonding.''"&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary biology theory of social behavior===
{{See also|Inclusive fitness}}

The book reviews the background and key elements of [[W.D.Hamilton|Hamilton's]] [[inclusive fitness]] theory from the 1960s onwards, setting out its significant conceptual and heuristic value. Holland notes that Hamilton acknowledged that his earliest and most widely known account (1964)&lt;ref name="Hamilton, William D 1964"&gt;Hamilton, William D. 1964. The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour. Journal of Theoretical Biology 7:1-52. 1964&lt;/ref&gt; contained technical inaccuracies. He also notes Hamilton's early speculations about possible proximate mechanisms of the expression of social behavior (''supergenes''&lt;ref name="Hamilton, William D 1964"/&gt; as a possible alternative to ''behaviour-evoking-situations''&lt;ref name="Hamilton, William D 1964"/&gt;) contained errors that have nevertheless remained very influential in popular accounts. Specifically, the supergenes notion (sometimes called the ''[[Green-beard effect]]'') - that organisms may evolve genes that are able to identify identical copies in others and preferentially direct social behaviours towards them - was theoretically clarified and withdrawn by Hamilton in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, William D. 1987. Discriminating nepotism: expectable, common and overlooked. In Kin recognition in animals, edited by D. J. C. Fletcher and C. D. Michener. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the intervening years, the notion that supergenes (or more often, simply individual organisms) have evolved ''to identify genetic relatives and preferentially cooperate with them'' took hold, and became the way many biologists came to understand the theory. This persisted, despite Hamilton's 1987 correction. In Holland's view it is the pervasiveness of this longstanding but erroneous perspective, and the suppression of the alternative 'behaviour-evoking-situations' perspective regarding social expression mechanisms, that is largely responsible for the ongoing clash between biological and sociocultural approaches to human kinship.

===Sociobiology and kinship===

Holland shows that, in the 1970s and 80s, the first wave of attempts (known as ''human [[sociobiology]]'' or ''[[Darwinian anthropology]]'') to apply inclusive fitness theory to human social behavior relied on, and further reinforced, this same misinterpretation (above section) about the theory's predictions and the proximate mechanisms of social behavior. Holland also shows that this period of research was burdened with many misplaced assumptions about ''universal'' attributes of the human sexes, [[sexuality]] and [[gender]] roles, apparently projected from the ''specific cultural values'' of the researchers themselves. Holland also shows that, following the perceived failures of this early wave, and particularly its methodological agnosticism regarding proximate mechanisms of social behavior, the [[evolutionary psychology]] school grew up in its place. Although this latter school typically avoided engaging with the ethnographic data on human kinship, Holland argues that in the few cases where it did so, it repeated the misinterpretation of inclusive fitness theory that characterized the first wave. Holland also notes that [[Philip Kitcher|Kitcher]], in his&lt;ref&gt;Kitcher, Philip. 1985. Vaulting Ambition: Sociobiology and the Quest for Human Nature. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; critique of the sociobiological position, suggested that perhaps the expression of social behaviors in humans might quite simply be based on cues of context and familiarity, rather than genetic relatedness ''per se''.

===Proximate mechanisms and 'kin recognition'===
{{See also| Kin recognition}}

Chapters four and five investigate further the theory and evidence surrounding the ''proximate mechanisms'' of social behavior; specifically the question of whether social behaviors are expressed by organisms via ''behaviour-evoking-situations'' or via direct detection of actual genetic relatedness. Related questions have been the domain of [[kin recognition]] theory. Holland notes that the name 'kin recognition' itself suggests some expectation that a positive identification of genetic relatedness is a prediction of inclusive fitness theory, and is thus expected. Similar points have been made by others; "many behavioural ecologists seem to implicitly assume that specialised mechanisms allowing individuals to distinguish their kin from non-kin must have evolved.&lt;ref&gt;Tang-Martinez, Z. 2001. The mechanisms of kin discrimination and the evolution of kin recognition in vertebrates: a critical re-evaluation. Behavioural Processes 53:21-40. Page 21)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grafen, A. 1990. Do animals really recognize kin? Animal Behaviour 39:42-54.&lt;/ref&gt;" Again, the possibility that ''behaviour-evoking-situations'' might be the more parsimonious&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, William D. 1987. Discriminating nepotism: expectable, common and overlooked. In Kin recognition in animals, edited by D. J. C. Fletcher and C. D. Michener. New York: Wiley. On page 420, Hamilton clearly states that ''"Altruistic or selfish acts are only possible when a suitable social object is available. In this sense behaviours are conditional from the start.''"&lt;/ref&gt; mechanism of the expression of social behavior, and fully compatible with inclusive fitness theory, has often been underemphasized. However, Holland's review of the evidence notes that field studies in this area quickly established that ''behaviour-evoking-situations'' do in fact overwhelmingly mediate social behaviours in those species studied, and that, particularly in mammal species, social bonding and familiarity formed in early developmental contexts (e.g. in burrows or nesting sites) are a common mediating mechanism for social behaviors, independently of genetic relatedness ''per se''. On the basis of the preceding theoretical analysis and review of evidence, at the end of chapter five, Holland argues that;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is entirely erroneous, both in reference to theory and in reference to the evidence, to claim or suggest that 'the facts of biology' support the claim that organisms have evolved to cooperate with genetic relatives ''per se''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Primate social bonding and attachment theory===
{{See also| Attachment theory}}

Having argued for the above position on the lack of necessity for genetic relatedness ''per se'' to mediate social bonding and behavior, Holland suggests that "The further question then is; can we uncover in any greater detail how familiarity and other context-dependent cues operate?"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;. To discover the extent to which the variety of human kinship behaviors may nevertheless be compatible with this (less deterministic) interpretation of biological theory of social behavior, Holland suggests that a survey of [[primate|primates']] most fundamental social patterns may give clues, especially those of species most closely connected with humans. The variety of primate [[mating system]]s, group-membership ('[[philopatry]]') patterns, and life-cycle patterns are reviewed. Holland finds that;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like other mammals, Catarrhini primate demographics are strongly influenced by ecological conditions, particularly density and distribution of food sources... Cohesive social groups and delayed natal dispersal mean that maternally related individuals, including maternal siblings, face a statistically reliable context of interaction in all Catarrhini primates. This reliable context of interaction with maternally related individuals is extended amongst those species with female philopatry (especially Cercopithecinae).&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As with other social mammals, evidence suggest that the reliability of 'behaviour-evoking-situations' this social context provides has shaped the mechanisms of proximate expression of social bonding and behavior;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Adoption of infants by females (and sometimes males) demonstrates that care-giving and bonding to infants is not mediated by positive powers of discrimination. From the infant's perspective, it will bond with any responsive carer. If not necessarily the actual mother, in natural conditions this will often be a maternal relative (particularly an older sibling), but the context is primary, not the actual relatedness. Similarly, social bonding and social behaviours between maternal siblings (and occasionally between other maternal relatives) is context-driven in primates, and mediated via the care-giver.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Holland also notes how [[John Bowlby|Bowlby]] and colleagues' [[attachment theory]] was strongly informed by primate bonding patterns and mechanisms, and that in Bowlby's later writing the then emerging [[inclusive fitness]] theory was explicitly linked to. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Bowlby's] work demonstrated that social attachments form on the basis of provision of care, and responsiveness to elicitations for care. The social context of living together and the familiarity this brings, provides the circumstance within which social bonds can form...&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the basis of combining more recent primate research with the findings of attachment theory, Holland proposes that "In attempting to define more specific forms of ''the giving of care and nurture'' which may mediate social bonding we [find] that provision of food is likely to play a part, as well as the more intangible provision of warmth and comfort, and a safe base for sleeping.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;"

===Processual and nurture kinship in humans===
{{See also|Nurture kinship}}

Holland claims that, while biological theory of social behavior is not [[determinism|deterministic]] in respect of genetic relatedness vis-a-vis the formation of social bonds and expression of social behaviors, evidence does point to compatibility between a [[reductionism|non-reductive]] interpretation of the theory and how such bonds and behaviors operate in social mammals, primates and in humans. In the final part of the book, Holland explores the extent to which this perspective is also compatible with sociocultural anthropology's ethnographic accounts of human kinship and social behavior, both occasional accounts from the past, as well as more contemporary accounts that have explicitly eschewed the earlier 'blood ties' assumption. Holland finds that;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many contemporary accounts focus on social bonds formed in childhood and the importance of the performance of acts of care, including food provision, in mediating these bonds. In all cases it is this performance of care which is considered the overriding factor in
mediating social bonds, notwithstanding 'blood ties'. In short, there is strong compatibility between the perspectives on social bonding that emerge from a proper account of biological theory and those documented by ethnographers.&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 282&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Conclusion===

Holland's concluding chapter gives a summary of his fundamental position;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A crucial implication of this argument taken as a whole is that ''the expression of the kinds of social behaviours treated by inclusive fitness theory does not require genetic relatedness.'' Sociobiology and evolutionary psychology's claims that biological science predicts that organisms ''will'' direct social behaviour towards relatives are thus both ''theoretically'' and ''empirically'' erroneous. Such claims and their supporting arguments also give a highly misleading and reductive account of basic biological theory. Properly interpreted, ''cultural anthropology approaches (and ethnographic data) and biological approaches are perfectly compatible'' regarding processes of social bonding in humans. Most of all, this requires a focus on the circumstances and processes which lead to social bonding.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book notes that, as an outcome of the analysis, [[David M. Schneider|Schneider's]] sociocultural perspective on human kinship is vindicated;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Do the biological facts have some priority or are they but one of the conditions, like ecology, economy, demography, etc., to which kinship systems must adapt? Take note: if the latter is the case, then kinship must be as much rooted in these other conditions as in the biological facts.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, David M. 1984. A critique of the study of kinship. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press. Page 139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The author supplies several examples of the insight that Schneider's broad approach can provide. The book closes with an example of a clash of cultural perspectives on kinship and family norms, and makes the suggestion that;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Constructing from narrow cultural particulars (Euro-American or otherwise) an essentialised model of 'human nature' does not constitute science; it is closer to cultural colonialism. In any analysis intended to shed light on proposed universals of the human condition, reflexivity is essential, and cultural and biological approaches both surely necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 292&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception and reviews==

===General===
Kinship theorist and member of the [[national academy of science]], [[Robin Fox]] wrote of the work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;An excellent and constructive discussion of matters in kinship and its cultural and biological components, handsomely reconciling what have been held to be incompatible positions.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Fox commentary, Fox's Website, http://robin-fox.com/books.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max Holland gets to the heart of the matter concerning the contentious relationship between kinship categories, genetic relatedness and the prediction of behavior. If he had been in the debate in the 1980s then a lot of subsequent confusion could have been avoided"&lt;ref name="RF2012"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Irwin Bernstein, distinguished research professor in the university of Georgia's ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences Program'' made the following comment on Holland's book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Max Holland has demonstrated extraordinarily thorough scholarship in his exhaustive review of the often contentious discussions of kinship.  He has produced a balanced synthesis melding the two approaches exemplified in the biological and sociocultural behavioral positions. His work in reconciling opposing views clearly demonstrates the value of interdisciplinary approaches.  This should be the definitive word on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin Bernstein comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Philip Kitcher]], John Dewey Professor of Philosophy, and James R. Barker Professorship of Contemporary Civilization at [[Columbia University]], past president of the [[American Philosophical Association]] and inaugural winner of the Prometheus Prize, stated of the book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Max Holland has provided a wide-ranging and deeply-probing analysis of the influence of genetic relatedness and social context on human kinship. He argues that while genetic relatedness may play a role in the evolution of social behavior, it does not determine the forms of such behavior. His discussion is exemplary for its thoroughness, and should inspire more nuanced ventures in applying Darwinian approaches to sociocultural anthropology.&lt;ref name="amazon.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Sociocultural anthropology===
Kirk Endicott, professor emeritus of [[anthropology]] at the university of Dartmouth, wrote that Holland's book was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A brilliant discussion of the relationship between kinship and social bonding as understood in evolutionary biology and in sociocultural anthropology. Among other contributions, it debunks the common misconception that biological evolution involves individual organisms actively pursuing the goal of increasing the numbers of their genes in successive generations, the measure of their so-called ‘individual inclusive fitness’. Holland demonstrates that an alternative non-deterministic interpretation of evolutionary biology is more compatible with actual human social behavior and with the frameworks that sociocultural anthropology employs.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk Endicott comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Janet Carsten, kinship theorist and professor of anthropology at the university of Edinburgh stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This book is a scholarly attempt to get beyond the often sterile oppositions between evolutionary and culturalist approaches to kinship. In bringing together two sides of the debate, it constitutes a valuable contribution to kinship studies.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Carsten comment, Author's website, |url=https://maximilianholland.com/2013/04/25/social-bonding-and-nurture-kinship-synopsis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a review for the journal [[Critique of Anthropology]], Nicholas Malone concluded that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lucid and effective... Holland has produced a significant work of scholarship that will be of interest to a wide swath of the anthropological community.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Malone Review, Critique of Anthropology, DOI: 10.1177/0308275X15594535&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Commenting on the book for the journal [[Social Analysis]], Anni Kajanus found that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Holland has done an excellent and thorough job in reviewing the disciplinary and interdisciplinary histories of approaches to kinship and social bonds in anthropology, biology, and psychology. Most importantly, he clarifies the different levels of analysis when looking at human behavior in real time and in the evolutionary time frame. This makes the book essential reading for anyone who acknowledges that human relatedness and social bonds are shaped by the
evolved dispositions of our species, their development through the life-course of an individual, and our specific cultural-historical environments... Holland’s book goes a long way toward clarifying and therefore advancing these theoretical debates&lt;ref&gt;Anni Kajanus Review, Social Analysis, web: http://www.berghahnjournals.com/abstract/journals/social-analysis/60/3/sa600308.xml, DOI: 10.3167/sa.2016.600308&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Biology===
An in-depth review of the book by [[primatology|primatologist]] Augusto Vitale, in the journal ''[[Folia Primatologica]]'', found that:
                                                                                                                                                                      &lt;blockquote&gt;This is, without a doubt, a very significant and important contribution to the on-going discussion about the determinants of sociality in humans as well as in other animals... A painstaking analysis of inclusive fitness, attachment theory and non-human primate social relationships, through a fascinating journey which ends with an anthropological account of social bonds in different cultures... It is a landmark in the field of evolutionary biology, which places genetic determinism in the correct perspective.&lt;ref name=AV2014 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stuart Semple, evolutionary anthropologist, reviewing the book in the journal ''[[Acta Ethologica]]'' stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As someone who teaches behavioural ecology to biologists, and primate biology to social and biological anthropologists, I will be strongly recommending this book to all of my advanced undergraduates, masters and PhD students, as well as to my colleagues. Not only does it help to resolve debates that have run for many years, but it is also an outstanding example of what can be achieved by immersing oneself in literature from different fields, while retaining an intellectual openness and exercising incisive analysis. Many of us talk enthusiastically about inter- and multi-disciplinarity, but often this is not much more than lip service. This book is a shining example of what can be achieved when excellent scholars engage fully across disciplinary boundaries. There should be more texts like this.&lt;ref name=SS2015 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Published debate and criticism of the book==
{{Expand section|1=examples and additional citations|date=September 2014}}

In addition to praise for the book's significance, the [[Folia Primatologica]] review noted that the book is at times too dense and requires close reading;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The argument here and there becomes too detailed and tortuous, but it is absolutely captivating... [Colleagues] who are less used to extremely detailed theoretical reasoning, will find it difficult at the beginning...&lt;ref name=AV2014 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Tactoids''' are [[liquid crystal]] [[wiktionary:microdomain|microdomains]] nucleated in [[isotropic]] phases, which can be distinguished as spherical or spindle-shaped [[birefringence|birefringent]] microdroplets under [[polarized light microscopy]]. Tactoids are a transition state between [[isotropic]] and [[macroscopic]] liquid crystalline phases.

'''293T''' (or HEK293T) is a human cell line, derived from the [[HEK 293]] cell line, that expresses a mutant version of the [[SV40 large T antigen]].  It is very commonly used in biology for protein expression and production of recombinant [[retroviruses]].

== Origin ==
293T was created in Michele Calos's lab at Stanford by [[transfection#Stable and transient transfection|stable transfection]] of the HEK 293 cell line with a plasmid encoding a temperature-sensitive mutant of the SV40 large T antigen; it was originally referred to as 293/''tsA1609neo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=DuBridge RB, Tang P, Hsia HC, Leong PM, Miller JH, Calos MP |title=Analysis of mutation in human cells by using an Epstein-Barr virus shuttle system |journal=Mol. Cell. Biol. |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=379–387 |date=Jan 1987 |pmid=3031469 |pmc=365079 |doi=10.1128/MCB.7.1.379 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first reference to the cell line as "293T" may be its use to create the [[BOSC23]] packaging cell line for producing retroviral particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pear WS, Nolan GP, Scott ML, Baltimore D |title=Production of high-titer helper-free retroviruses by transient transfection |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA |volume=90 |issue=18 |pages=8392–8396 |date=15 Sep 1993 |pmid=7690960 |pmc=47362 |doi=10.1073/pnas.90.18.8392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
The transfection used to create 293T (involving plasmid pRSV-1609) conferred [[neomycin]]/[[G418]] resistance and expression of the tsA1609 allele of SV40 large T antigen; this allele is fully active at 33&amp;nbsp;°C (its [[permissive temperature]]), has substantial function at 37&amp;nbsp;°C, and is inactive at 40&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rio DC, Clark SG, Tjian R |title=A mammalian host-vector system that regulates expression and amplification of transfected genes by temperature induction |journal=Science |volume=227 |issue=4682 |pages=23–28 |date=4 Jan 1985 |pmid=2981116 |doi=10.1126/science.2981116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  293T is very efficiently transfectable with DNA (like its parent HEK 293).  Due to the expression of SV40 large T antigen, transfected plasmid DNAs that carry the SV40 [[origin of replication]] can replicate in 293T and will transiently maintain a high copy number; this can greatly increase the amount of recombinant protein or retrovirus that can be produced from the cells.

== Genome ==
The full genome sequences of three different isolates of 293T have been determined.  They are quite similar to each other but show detectable divergence from the parental HEK 293 cell line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lin YC, Boone M, Meuris L, Lemmens I, Van Roy N, Soete A, Reumers J, Moisse M, Plaisance S, Drmanac R, Chen J, Speleman F, Lambrechts D, Van de Peer Y, Tavernier J, Callewaert N |title=Genome dynamics of the human embryonic kidney 293 lineage in response to cell biology manipulations |journal=Nat.

'''Macrobiology''' is the branch of [[biology]] that studies large living organisms (termed Macro organisms) that can be seen by the naked eye. Macrobiology is the opposite of [[Microbiology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reference.com/science/macro-biology-bfdffb44d78aa221|title=What is macro biology?|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Macrocosm and Microcosm'''

Macrocosm and Microcosm is an important concept in Macrobiology. It refers to a vision of [[cosmos]] where the part reflects the whole (macrocosm) and vice versa. It is a feature "present in all esoteric schools of thinking", according to scholar [[Pierre A. Riffard]]. It underlies practices such as [[astrology]], [[alchemy]] and [[sacred geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shekpvar.net/~dna/Publications/Cosmos/cosmos.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412094332/http://www.shekpvar.net/~dna/Publications/Cosmos/cosmos.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-04-12 |title=Cosmos - an Illustrated Dimensional Journey from microcosmos to macrocosmos |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=2016-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A transboundary [[breed]] is a breed which is present in several countries.&lt;ref&gt;FAO. August 2012. Intergovernmental Technical Working Group on Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, Seventh Session. http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/026/me588e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Transboundary [[species]] of the five significant [[livestock]] types (cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and chickens), have been developed for a hundred years or more in intensive manufacturing systems, which has led to global availability.  A relatively small number of worldwide transboundary breeds compose the ever-increasing share of total global animal products. However, only in [[North America]] and the [[Southwest Pacific]] do the number of transboundary breeds surpass that of local breeds.&lt;ref&gt;Sep. 2013. AgriCultures Network. Livestock breeding and small-scale keepers. http://www.agriculturesnetwork.org/resources/learning/mod4-online/learning-block-2/2.3/2.3.1 accessed Nov. 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

There can be both regional and international types of transboundary breeds. Regional breeds are breeds that are reported to only be found in one "region", which may include several countries, and an international transboundary breed is one that is reported to be found in multiple regions. For example, the Holstein Fresian cattle is an international transboundary breed, because it is found in several different continents and regions.

In [[biology]], '''solenocytes''' are [[flagellate]]d [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s associated with [[excretion]], [[osmoregulation]] and [[ionoregulation]] in many non-chordates and in some [[chordate]]s under the sub-phylum [[Cephalochordate|Cephalochordata]] of the sub-group [[Protochordata]].

These are the cells which form subtypes of [[Protonephridium]] along with the other type i.e. [[Flame cell|Flame Cells]]. Flame cells can be distinguished from solenocytes as the former is usually [[ciliate]]d whereas the latter is flagellated.

An example of organisms in which excretion is performed by Solenocytic protonephridia is Genus ''[[Branchiostoma]].''

[[Image:Microscope with stained slide.jpg|right|thumb|A stained histologic specimen, sandwiched between a glass [[microscope slide]] and coverslip, mounted on the stage of a light microscope.]]

'''Staining''' is an auxiliary technique  used in [[microscopy]] to enhance contrast in the [[Microscope|microscopic]] image. Stains and [[dye]]s are frequently used in [[biology]] and [[medicine]] to highlight structures in [[biological tissue]]s for viewing, often with the aid of different [[microscope]]s. Stains may be used to define and examine bulk tissues (highlighting, for example, [[muscle fiber]]s or [[connective tissue]]), [[cell (biology)|cell]] populations (classifying different [[blood cell]]s, for instance), or [[organelle]]s within individual cells.

In [[biochemistry]] it involves adding a class-specific ([[DNA]], [[protein]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s) dye to a substrate to qualify or quantify the presence of a specific compound. Staining and [[fluorescent tag]]ging can serve similar purposes. Biological staining is also used to mark cells in [[flow cytometry]], and to flag [[protein]]s or [[nucleic acid]]s in [[gel electrophoresis]].

Simple staining is staining with only one stain/dye. There are various kinds of multiple staining, many of which are examples of [[counterstain]]ing, [[differential staining]], or both, including double staining and triple staining.

Staining is not limited to biological materials, it can also be used to study the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of other materials for example the lamellar structures of semi-crystalline [[polymer]]s or the domain structures of [[block copolymer]]s.

{{TOClimit|limit=2}}

== ''In vivo'' vs ''In vitro'' ==
''[[In vivo]]'' staining (also called vital staining or intravital staining) is the process of dyeing living tissues—''in vivo'' means "in life" (compare with ''[[in vitro]]'' staining).  By causing certain cells or structures to take on contrasting colour(s), their form (morphology) or position within a cell or tissue can be readily seen and studied. The usual purpose is to reveal cytological details that might otherwise not be apparent; however, staining can also reveal where certain chemicals or specific chemical reactions are taking place within cells or tissues.

''[[In vitro]]'' staining involves colouring cells or structures that have been removed from their biological context. Certain stains are often combined to reveal more details and features than a single stain alone.  Combined with specific protocols for [[fixation (histology)|fixation]] and sample preparation, scientists and physicians can use these standard techniques as consistent, repeatable diagnostic tools. A [[counterstain]] is stain that makes cells or structures more visible, when not completely visible with the principal stain.
* For example, [[crystal violet]] stains only [[Gram-positive]] bacteria in [[Gram staining]]. A [[safranin]] counterstain is applied that stains all cells, allowing identification of Gram-negative bacteria.

While ex vivo, many cells continue to live and metabolize until they are "fixed". Some staining methods are based on this property. Those stains excluded by the living cells but taken up by the  already dead cells are called [[vital stain]]s (e.g. [[trypan blue]] or [[propidium iodide]] for eukaryotic cells). Those that enter and stain living cells are called [[supravital stain]]s (e.g. [[New Methylene Blue]] and [[brilliant cresyl blue]] for [[reticulocyte]] staining). However, these stains are eventually toxic to the organism, some more so than others.  Partly due to their toxic interaction inside a living cell, when supravital stains enter a living cell, they might produce a characteristic pattern of staining different from the staining of an already fixed cell (e.g. "reticulocyte" look versus diffuse "polychromasia"). To achieve desired effects, the stains are used in very dilute solutions ranging from {{gaps|1|:|5|000}} to {{gaps|1|:|500|000}} (Howey, 2000). Note that many stains may be used in both living and fixed cells.

=== In vitro methods ===

==== Preparation ====
The preparatory steps involved depend on the type of analysis planned; some or all of the following procedures may be required.

'''[[Fixation (histology)|Fixation]]'''–which may itself consist of several steps–aims to preserve the shape of the cells or tissue involved as much as possible.  Sometimes [[heat fixation]] is used to kill, adhere, and alter the specimen so it accepts stains. Most chemical fixatives (chemicals causing fixation) generate [[chemical bond]]s between [[protein]]s and other substances within the sample, increasing their rigidity.  Common fixatives  include [[formaldehyde]], [[ethanol]], [[methanol]], and/or [[picric acid]].  Pieces of tissue may be embedded in [[paraffin wax]] to increase their mechanical strength and stability and to make them easier to cut into thin slices.

'''Permeabilization''' involves treatment of cells with (usually) a mild [[surfactant]].  This treatment dissolves [[cell membrane]]s, and allows larger dye molecules into the cell's interior.

'''[[Microscope slide#Mounting|Mounting]]''' usually involves attaching the samples to a glass microscope slide for observation and analysis.  In some cases, cells may be grown directly on a slide.  For samples of loose cells (as with a blood smear or a [[pap smear]]) the sample can be directly applied to a slide.  For larger pieces of tissue, thin sections (slices) are made using a [[microtome]]; these slices can then be mounted and inspected.

==== Standardization ====

Most of the dyes commonly used in microscopy are available as '''BSC-certified stains'''. This means that samples of the manufacturer's batch have been tested by an independent body, the [[Biological Stain Commission]] ('''BSC'''), and found to meet or exceed certain standards of purity, dye content and performance in staining techniques. These standards are published in the Commission's journal [[Biotechnic &amp; Histochemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Penney DP, Powers JM, Frank M, Churukian C |title=Analysis and testing of biological stains—the Biological Stain Commission Procedures |pmid=12564600| journal=Biotechnic &amp; Histochemistry |year= 2002 |volume=77|issue=5–6|pages=237–275 |doi=10.1080/714028210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many dyes are inconsistent in composition from one supplier to another. The use of BSC-certified stains eliminates a source of unexpected results.&lt;ref name="HorobinKiernan" /&gt;

Some vendors sell stains "certified" by themselves rather than by the Biological Stain Commission. Such products may or may not be suitable for diagnostic and other applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biologicalstaincommission.org/vendors-list/|title=Vendors List - The Biological Stain Commission|author=|date=|website=biologicalstaincommission.org|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Negative staining ====
A simple staining method for bacteria that is usually successful, even when the "positive staining" methods detailed below fail, is to use a [[negative stain]]. This can be achieved by smearing the sample onto the slide and then applying [[nigrosin]] (a black synthetic dye) or [[India ink]] (an aqueous suspension of carbon particles). After drying, the microorganisms may be viewed in bright field microscopy as lighter inclusions well-contrasted against the dark environment surrounding them.&lt;ref&gt;Clark G (1981) ''Staining Procedures'', 4th ed., Baltimore: Williams &amp; Wilkins, p. 412, {{ISBN|0683017071}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Note: negative staining is a mild technique that may not destroy the microorganisms, and is therefore unsuitable for studying pathogens.

=== Specific techniques ===

==== Gram staining ====
{{main|Gram staining}}
[[Gram staining]] is used to determine gram status to classify bacteria broadly. It is based on the composition of their [[cell wall]]. Gram staining uses [[Gentian violet|crystal violet]] to stain cell walls, [[iodine]] as a mordant, and a [[fuchsin]] or [[safranin]] counterstain to mark all bacteria. Gram status is important in medicine; the presence or absence of a cell wall changes the bacterium's susceptibility to some [[antibiotic]]s.

[[Gram-positive]] bacteria stain dark blue or violet. Their [[cell wall]] is typically &lt;!-- but not always !! --&gt; rich with [[peptidoglycan]] and lacks the secondary membrane and [[lipopolysaccharide]] layer found in Gram-negative bacteria.

On most Gram-stained preparations, [[Gram-negative]] organisms appear red or pink because they are counterstained. Because of presence of higher lipid content, after alcohol-treatment, the porosity of the cell wall increases, hence the CVI complex (crystal violet – iodine) can pass through. Thus, the primary stain is not retained. Also, in contrast to most Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria have only a few layers of peptidoglycan and a secondary cell membrane made primarily of lipopolysaccharide.

==== Endospore staining ====
{{main|Endospore staining}}
[[Endospore staining]] is used to identify the presence or absence of [[endospore]]s, which make bacteria very difficult to kill. This is particularly useful for identifying endospore-forming bacterial [[pathogen]]s such as ''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]]''.

==== Ziehl-Neelsen stain ====
[[Ziehl-Neelsen stain]]ing is used to stain species of ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' that do not stain with the standard laboratory staining procedures such as Gram staining.

The stains used are the red coloured [[Carbol fuchsin]] that stains the bacteria and a counter stain such as [[Methylene blue]]

==== Haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining ====
[[Image:Emphysema H and E.jpg|right|thumb|Microscopic view of a histologic specimen of human [[lung]] tissue stained with [[hematoxylin]] and [[eosin]].]]
[[H&amp;E stain|Haematoxylin and eosin stain]]ing protocol is used frequently in [[histology]] to examine thin sections of tissue.  [[Haematoxylin]] stains cell nuclei blue, while [[eosin]] stains cytoplasm, connective tissue and other extracellular substances pink or red.  Eosin is strongly absorbed by [[red blood cell]]s, colouring them bright red. In a skilfully made H &amp; E preparation the red blood cells are almost orange, and collagen and cytoplasm (especially muscle) acquire different shades of pink. When the staining is done by a machine, the subtle differences in eosinophilia are often lost. Hematoxylin stains the cell nucleus and other acidic structures (such as RNA-rich portions of the cytoplasm and the matrix of hyaline cartilage) blue. In contrast, eosin stains the cytoplasm and collagen pink.

==== Papanicolaou staining ====
[[Papanicolaou stain]]ing, or Pap staining, is a frequently used method for examining cell samples from various bodily secretions. It is frequently used to stain [[Pap smear]] specimens. It uses a combination of [[haematoxylin]], [[Orange G]], [[eosin Y]], [[Light Green SF yellowish]], and sometimes [[Bismarck Brown Y]].

==== PAS staining ====
[[Image:Histoplasma pas-d small.jpg|thumb|right|[[PAS diastase]] showing the fungus [[Histoplasma]].]]
[[Periodic acid-Schiff]] staining is used to mark [[carbohydrate]]s ([[glycogen]], [[glycoprotein]], [[proteoglycan]]s). It is used to distinguish different types of glycogen storage diseases.

==== Masson's trichrome ====
[[Masson's trichrome]] is (as the name implies) a three-colour staining protocol.  The recipe has evolved from Masson's original technique for different specific applications, but all are well-suited to distinguish cells from surrounding [[connective tissue]].  Most recipes produce red [[keratin]] and muscle fibers, blue or green staining of [[collagen]] and [[bone]], light red or pink staining of [[cytoplasm]], and black [[cell nucleus|cell nuclei]].

==== Romanowsky stains ====
The [[Romanowsky stain]]s are all based on a combination of eosinate (chemically [[reduction (chemistry)|reduced]] [[eosin]]) and [[methylene blue]] (sometimes with its oxidation products [[azure A]] and [[azure B]]).  Common variants include [[Wright's stain]], [[Jenner's stain]], May-Grunwald stain, [[Leishman stain]] and [[Giemsa stain]].

All are used to examine [[blood]] or [[bone marrow]] samples.  They are preferred over H&amp;E for inspection of blood cells because different types of [[white blood cells|leukocytes]] (white blood cells) can be readily distinguished.  All are also suited to examination of blood to detect blood-borne parasites such as [[malaria]].

==== Silver staining ====
[[Image:Histoplasma in granuloma gms.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gömöri methenamine silver stain]] demonstrating [[histoplasma]] (black round balls).]]
[[Silver stain]]ing is the use of [[silver]] to stain [[histologic section]]s. This kind of staining is important especially to show [[protein]]s (for example type III [[collagen]]) and [[DNA]]. It is used to show both substances inside and outside [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. Silver staining is also used in [[temperature gradient gel electrophoresis]].

Some cells are ''argentaffin''. These [[Redox|reduce]] silver solution to metallic silver after [[formalin]] [[fixation (histology)|fixation]]. This method was discovered by Italian [[Camillo Golgi]], by using a reaction between [[silver nitrate]] and [[potassium dichromate]], thus precipitating silver chromate in some cells (see [[Golgi's method]]). Other cells are ''argyrophilic''. These reduce silver solution to metallic silver after being exposed to the stain that contains a [[Reducing agent|reductant]], for example [[hydroquinone]] or formalin.

==== Sudan staining ====
[[Sudan stain]]ing is the use of Sudan dyes to stain sudanophilic substances, usually [[lipid]]s. [[Sudan III]], [[Sudan IV]], [[Oil Red O]], [[Osmium tetroxide]], and [[Sudan Black B]] are often used. Sudan staining is often used to determine the level of [[fecal fat]] to diagnose [[steatorrhea]].

==== Conklin's staining ====
Special technique designed for staining true endospores with the use of malachite green dye, once stained, they do not decolourize.

== Common biological stains ==
Different stains react or concentrate in different parts of a cell or tissue, and these properties are used to advantage to reveal specific parts or areas.  Some of the most common biological stains are listed below.  Unless otherwise marked, all of these dyes may be used with fixed cells and tissues; vital dyes (suitable for use with living organisms) are noted.

=== Acridine orange ===
[[Acridine orange]] (AO) is a nucleic acid selective fluorescent cationic dye useful for cell cycle determination. It is cell-permeable, and interacts with DNA and RNA by intercalation or electrostatic attractions. When bound to DNA, it is very similar spectrally to fluorescein. Like fluorescein, it is also useful as a non-specific stain for backlighting conventionally stained cells on the surface of a solid sample of tissue (fluorescence backlighted staining&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wells | first1 = J | year = 1988 | title = A Technique for Staining the Superficial Cells of Plucked Hair Follicles and Other Solid Tissues | url = | journal = Stain Technology | volume = 63 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Bismarck brown ===
[[Bismarck brown Y|Bismarck brown]] (also Bismarck brown Y or Manchester brown) imparts a yellow colour to acid [[mucin]]s.

=== Carmine ===
[[Image:Pseudorhabdosynochus morrhua.jpg|thumb|[[Carmine]] staining of a parasitic flatworm.]]
[[Carmine]] is an intensely red dye used to stain [[glycogen]], while Carmine alum is a nuclear stain.  Carmine stains require the use of a mordant, usually [[aluminum]].

=== Coomassie blue ===
[[Coomassie Brilliant Blue|Coomassie blue]] (also brilliant blue) nonspecifically stains proteins a strong blue colour.  It is often used in gel electrophoresis.

===Cresyl violet===

[[Cresyl violet stain|Cresyl violet]] stains the acidic components of the neuronal cytoplasm a violet colour, specifically [[Nissl body|nissl]] bodies. Often used in brain research.

=== Crystal violet ===
[[Crystal violet]], when combined with a suitable mordant, stains [[cell wall]]s purple.  Crystal violet is the stain used in Gram staining.

=== DAPI ===
[[DAPI]] is a [[fluorescent]] nuclear stain, excited by [[ultraviolet]] light and showing strong blue fluorescence when bound to [[DNA]].  DAPI binds with A=T rich repeats of chromosomes. DAPI is also not visible with regular transmission microscopy. It may be used in living or fixed cells. DAPI-stained cells are especially appropriate for cell counting.&lt;ref&gt;Levenfus, I.: ''An efficient method for counting DAPI-stained cells using Fiji''. Grin: Munich. 2011. {{ISBN|978-3-640-86284-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eosin ===
[[Eosin]] is most often used as a counterstain to haematoxylin, imparting a pink or red colour to [[cytoplasm]]ic material, [[cell membrane]]s, and some extracellular structures.  It also imparts a strong red colour to [[red blood cell]]s.  Eosin may also be used as a counterstain in some variants of Gram staining, and in many other protocols.  There are actually two very closely related compounds commonly referred to as eosin.  Most often used is eosin Y (also known as eosin Y ws or eosin yellowish); it has a very slightly yellowish cast.  The other eosin compound is eosin B (eosin bluish or imperial red); it has a very faint bluish cast.  The two dyes are interchangeable, and the use of one or the other is more a matter of preference and tradition.

=== Ethidium bromide ===
[[Ethidium bromide]] [[intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalates]] and stains DNA, providing a fluorescent red-orange stain. Although it will not stain healthy cells, it can be used to identify cells that are in the final stages of [[apoptosis]] – such cells have much more permeable [[biological membrane|membranes]]. Consequently, ethidium bromide is often used as a marker for apoptosis in cells populations and to locate bands of DNA in [[gel electrophoresis]]. The stain may also be used in conjunction with [[acridine orange]] (AO) in viable cell counting. This EB/AO combined stain causes live cells to fluoresce green whilst apoptotic cells retain the distinctive red-orange fluorescence.

=== Acid fuchsine ===
[[Fuchsine|Acid fuchsine]] may be used to stain collagen, smooth muscle, or [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]].
Acid fuchsine is used as the nuclear and cytoplasmic stain in Mallory's trichrome method. Acid fuchsine stains cytoplasm in some variants of Masson's trichrome.  In Van Gieson's picro-fuchsine, acid fuchsine imparts its red colour to collagen fibres. Acid fuchsine is also a traditional stain for mitochondria (Altmann's method).

=== Haematoxylin ===
[[Haematoxylin]] (hematoxylin in North America) is a nuclear stain.  Used with a mordant, haematoxylin stains nuclei blue-violet or brown.  It is most often used with eosin in H&amp;E (haematoxylin and eosin) staining—one of the most common procedures in [[histology]].

=== Hoechst stains ===
[[Hoechst stain|Hoechst]] is a ''bis''-benzimidazole derivative compound that binds to the ''minor groove'' of [[DNA]]. Often used in fluorescence microscopy for DNA staining, Hoechst stains appear yellow when dissolved in aqueous solutions and emit blue light under UV excitation. There are two major types of [[Hoechst stain|Hoechst]]: ''Hoechst 33258'' and ''Hoechst 33342''. The two compounds are functionally similar, but with a little difference in structure. Hoechst 33258 contains a terminal [[hydroxyl]] group and is thus more soluble in aqueous solution, however this characteristics reduces its ability to penetrate the [[plasma membrane]]. Hoechst 33342 contains an [[ethyl group|ethyl]] substitution on the terminal hydroxyl group (i.e. an ethylether group) making it more hydrophobic for easier plasma membrane passage

=== Iodine ===
[[Iodine]] is used in [[chemistry]] as an indicator for [[starch]]. When starch is mixed with iodine in solution, an intensely dark blue colour develops, representing a starch/iodine complex. Starch is a substance common to most plant cells and so a weak iodine solution will stain starch present in the cells. Iodine is one component in the staining technique known as [[Gram staining]], used in [[microbiology]]. Used as a [[mordant]] in Gram's staining, iodine enhances the entrance of the dye through the pores present in the cell wall/membrane.

[[Lugol's iodine|Lugol's solution]] or Lugol's iodine (IKI) is a brown solution that turns black in the presence of starches and can be used as a cell stain, making the cell [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] more visible. 

Used with common vinegar (acetic acid), Lugol's solution is used to identify [[Cervical_cancer#Diagnosis|pre-cancerous and cancerous changes]] in cervical and vaginal tissues during "Pap smear" follow up examinations in preparation for biopsy. The acetic acid causes the abnormal cells to blanch white, while the normal tissues stain a mahogany brown from the iodine.&lt;ref&gt;Colposcopy and treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: a beginners’ manual, Edited by J.W. Sellors and R. Sankaranarayanan http://screening.iarc.fr/colpochap.php?lang=1&amp;chap=4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malachite green ===
[[Malachite green]] (also known as diamond green B or victoria green B) can be used as a blue-green counterstain to safranin in the [[Gimenez stain|Gimenez staining technique]] for bacteria.  It can also be used to directly stain [[endospore|spores]].

=== Methyl green ===
[[Methyl green]] is used commonly with bright-field, as well as fluorescence microscopes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prieto|first1=Daniel|last2=Aparicio|first2=Gonzalo|last3=Morande|first3=Pablo E.|last4=Zolessi|first4=Flavio R.|title=A fast, low cost, and highly efficient fluorescent DNA labeling method using methyl green|journal=Histochemistry and Cell Biology|date=27 March 2014|volume=142|issue=3|pages=335–345|doi=10.1007/s00418-014-1215-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; to dye the chromatin of cells so that they are more easily viewed.

=== Methylene blue ===
[[Methylene blue]] is used to stain animal cells, such as human cheek cells, to make their nuclei more observable. Also used to stain the blood film and used in cytology.

=== Neutral red ===
[[Neutral red]] (or toluylene red) stains [[Nissl body|Nissl substance]] red.  It is usually used as a counterstain in combination with other dyes.

=== Nile blue ===
[[Nile blue]] (or Nile blue A) stains nuclei blue.  It may be used with living cells.

=== Nile red ===
[[Nile red]] (also known as Nile blue oxazone) is formed by boiling Nile blue with [[sulfuric acid]].  This produces a mix of Nile red and Nile blue.  Nile red is a [[lipophilic]] stain; it will accumulate in [[lipid]] globules inside cells, staining them red.  Nile red can be used with living cells. It fluoresces strongly when partitioned into lipids, but practically not at all in aqueous solution.

=== Osmium tetroxide (formal name: osmium tetraoxide) ===
[[Osmium tetraoxide]] is used in optical microscopy to stain [[lipid]]s. It dissolves in fats, and is reduced by organic materials to elemental osmium, an easily visible black substance.

=== Propidium Iodide ===
[[Propidium iodide]] is a fluorescent intercalating agent that can be used to stain cells. Propidium iodide is used as a DNA stain in flow cytometry to evaluate cell viability or DNA content in cell cycle analysis, or in microscopy to visualise the nucleus and other DNA-containing organelles. Propidium Iodide cannot cross the membrane of live cells, making it useful to differentiate necrotic, apoptotic and healthy cells. PI also binds to RNA, necessitating treatment with nucleases to distinguish between RNA and DNA staining

=== Rhodamine ===
[[Rhodamine]] is a protein specific fluorescent stain commonly used in fluorescence microscopy.

=== Safranine ===
[[Safranine]] (or Safranine O) is a red cationic dye.  It binds to nuclei (DNA) and other tissue polyanions, including glycosaminoglycans in cartilage and mast cells, and components of lignin and plastids in plant tissues.&lt;ref&gt;Berlyn GP, Miksche JP (1976). ''Botanical Microtechnique and Cytochemistry''. Iowa State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Safranine should not be confused with saffron, an expensive natural dye that is used in some methods to impart a yellow colour to collagen, to contrast with blue and red colours imparted by other dyes to nuclei and cytoplasm in animal (including human) tissues.

The incorrect spelling "safranin" is in common use. The -ine ending is appropriate  
for safranine O because this dye is an amine,&lt;ref&gt;Baker JR (1958). ''Principles of Biological Microtechnique''. pp. 329 ff. London: Methuen.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=11871748|year=2001|author1=Kiernan|first1=J. A.|title=Classification and naming of dyes, stains and fluorochromes|journal=Biotechnic &amp; Histochemistry|volume=76|issue=5–6|pages=261–78|doi=10.1080/bih.76.5-6.261.278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HorobinKiernan"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=1859960995|title=Conn's Biological Stains: A Handbook of Dyes, Stains and Fluorochromes for Use in Biology and Medicine |year=2002|editor1=Horobin, Richard|editor2=Kiernan, John |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stainability of tissues==
Tissues which take up stains are called '''chromatic'''.  Chromosomes were so named because of their ability to absorb a violet stain.

Positive affinity for a specific stain may be designated by the suffix ''-philic''. For example, tissues that stain with an [[azure stain]] may be referred to as [[azurophil]]ic. This may also be used for more generalized staining properties, such as [[Acidophile (histology)|acidophilic]] for tissues that stain by [[acidic]] stains (most notably [[eosin]]), [[basophilic]] when staining in [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] dyes, and ''amphophilic''&lt;ref&gt;[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/amphophilic thefreedictionary.com &gt; amphophilic] Citing: ''Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary'', 3 ed. 2007 Elsevier, Inc&lt;/ref&gt; when staining with either acid or basic dyes. In contrast, [[chromophobe|chromophobic]] tissues do not take up coloured dye readily.

== Electron microscopy ==
As in light microscopy, stains can be used to enhance contrast in [[transmission electron microscopy]]. Electron-dense compounds of heavy metals are typically used.

===Phosphotungstic acid===
[[Phosphotungstic acid]] is a common [[negative stain]] for [[virus]]es, [[nerve]]s, [[polysaccharide]]s, and other biological tissue materials.

=== Osmium tetroxide ===
[[Osmium tetroxide]] is used in optical microscopy to stain [[lipid]]s. It dissolves in fats, and is reduced by organic materials to elemental osmium, an easily visible black substance.  Because it is a heavy metal that absorbs electrons, it is perhaps the most common stain used for morphology in biological electron microscopy. It is also used for the staining of various polymers for the study of their morphology by TEM. {{chem|OsO|4}} is very volatile and extremely toxic. It is a strong oxidizing agent as the osmium has an oxidation number of +8. It aggressively oxidizes many materials, leaving behind a deposit of non-volatile osmium in a lower oxidation state.

=== Ruthenium tetroxide ===
[[Ruthenium tetroxide]] is equally volatile and even more aggressive than osmium tetraoxide and able to stain even materials that resist the osmium stain, e.g. polyethylene.

Other chemicals used in electron microscopy staining include:
[[ammonium molybdate]], [[cadmium iodide]], [[carbohydrazide]], [[ferric chloride]], [[hexamine]], [[indium trichloride]], [[lanthanum nitrate]], [[lead acetate]], [[lead citrate]], [[lead(II) nitrate]], [[periodic acid]], [[phosphomolybdic acid]], [[potassium ferricyanide]], [[potassium ferrocyanide]], [[ruthenium red]], [[silver nitrate]], [[silver proteinate]], [[sodium chloroaurate]], [[thallium nitrate]], [[thiosemicarbazide]], [[uranyl acetate]], [[uranyl nitrate]], and [[vanadyl sulfate]].

'''Thermophyte''' ([[ancient Greek|Greek]] ''thérmos'' = warmth, heat + ''phyton'' = plant)  is a [[plant]] which is tolerant or thriving  at high temperatures. These plants are categorized according to [[ecological valence]]s at high temperatures, including biological extremely.

Darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', overcoming scientific rejection of earlier concepts of [[transmutation of species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why Evolution is True |last = Coyne |first=Jerry A. |authorlink=Jerry Coyne |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location= Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-923084-6 |page=17 |quote=In ''The Origin'', Darwin provided an alternative hypothesis for the development, diversification, and design of life.

However, many favoured [[The eclipse of Darwinism|competing explanations]] and it was not until the emergence of the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]] from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution.&lt;ref name=JvW&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b3847&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=178–179, 338, 347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the [[life sciences]], explaining the [[diversity of life]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://darwin-online.org.uk/biography.html The Complete Works of Darwin Online&amp;nbsp;– Biography.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107165048/http://darwin-online.org.uk/biography.html |date=7 January 2007 }} ''darwin-online.org.uk''.

It is one of the two or three most significant works of all time—one of those works that fundamentally and permanently alter our vision of the world...It is argued with a singularly rigorous consistency but it is also eloquent, imaginatively evocative, and rhetorically compelling." {{cite book |title=On the origin of species by means of natural selection |editor=Carroll, Joseph |year=2003 |publisher=Broadview |location= Peterborough, Ontario|isbn= 978-1-55111-337-1|page=15 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's early interest in nature led him to neglect his medical education at the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School|University of Edinburgh]]; instead, he helped to investigate [[marine invertebrates]]. Studies at the [[University of Cambridge]] ([[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]]) encouraged his passion for [[natural science]].&lt;ref name=whowas&gt;{{Harvnb|Leff|2000|loc=[http://www.aboutdarwin.com/darwin/WhoWas.html About Charles Darwin]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|five-year voyage]] on {{HMS|Beagle}} established him as an eminent geologist whose observations and theories supported [[Charles Lyell]]'s [[uniformitarian]] ideas, and publication of his [[The Voyage of the Beagle|journal of the voyage]] made him famous as a popular author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 210, 284–285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Puzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and fossils he collected on the voyage, Darwin began detailed investigations, and in 1838 conceived his theory of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=263–274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2007|pp=184, 187}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was writing up his theory in 1858 when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him an essay that described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of [[On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection|both of their theories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Beddall | first1 = B.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
{{See also|Charles Darwin's education|Darwin-Wedgwood family}}
Charles Robert Darwin was born in [[Shrewsbury]], Shropshire, on 12 February 1809, at his family's home, [[The Mount, Shrewsbury|The Mount]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Desmond|first=Adrian J.|title=Charles Darwin|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=13 September 2002|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Darwin|access-date=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://darwin.baruch.cuny.edu/biography/shrewsbury/mount/|title= The Mount House, Shrewsbury, England (Charles Darwin)|author= John H. Wahlert|date= 11 June 2001|work= Darwin and Darwinism|publisher= [[Baruch College]]|accessdate= 26 November 2008|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/68brqWXRx?url=http://faculty.baruch.cuny.edu/naturalscience/biology/darwin/|archivedate= 22 June 2012|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the fifth of six children of wealthy society doctor and financier [[Robert Darwin]] and [[Susannah Darwin]] (''née'' Wedgwood). He was the grandson of two prominent [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionists]]: [[Erasmus Darwin]] on his father's side, and [[Josiah Wedgwood]] on his mother's side.

[[File:Charles Darwin 1816.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Three quarter length portrait of seated boy smiling and looking at the viewer. He has straight mid-brown hair, and wears dark clothes with a large frilly white collar. In his lap he holds a pot of flowering plants|Painting of the seven-year-old Charles Darwin in 1816, by [[Ellen Sharples]].]]
Both families were largely [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], though the Wedgwoods were adopting [[Anglicanism]]. Robert Darwin, himself quietly a [[Freethought#England and France|freethinker]], had baby Charles [[baptism|baptised]] in November 1809 in the Anglican [[St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury]], but Charles and his siblings attended the Unitarian chapel with their mother. The eight-year-old Charles already had a taste for natural history and collecting when he joined the day school run by its preacher in 1817. That July, his mother died. From September 1818, he joined his older brother [[Erasmus Alvey Darwin|Erasmus]] attending the nearby Anglican [[Shrewsbury School]] as a [[boarding school|boarder]].&lt;ref name=skool&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 12–15}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=21 21–25]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin spent the summer of 1825 as an apprentice doctor, helping his father treat the poor of Shropshire, before going to the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]] (at the time the best medical school in the UK) with his brother Erasmus in October 1825. Darwin found lectures dull and surgery distressing, so he neglected his studies. He learned [[taxidermy]] in around 40 daily hour-long sessions from [[John Edmonstone]], a freed black slave who had accompanied [[Charles Waterton]] in the South American [[rainforest]].&lt;ref name=eddy&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=48 47–51]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb | Desmond |Moore | 2009 | pp=18–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Darwin's second year at the university he joined the [[Plinian Society]], a student [[natural history|natural-history]] group featuring lively debates in which [[radicalism (historical)#Popular agitation|radical democratic]] students with [[materialism|materialistic]] views challenged orthodox religious concepts of science.{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=31–34}} He assisted [[Robert Edmond Grant]]'s investigations of the anatomy and life cycle of [[marine invertebrates]] in the [[Firth of Forth]], and on 27 March 1827 presented at the Plinian his own discovery that black spores found in [[oyster]] shells were the eggs of a skate [[leech]]. One day, Grant praised [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarck]]'s [[Lamarckism|evolutionary ideas]]. Darwin was astonished by Grant's audacity, but had recently read similar ideas in his grandfather Erasmus' journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=72–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin was rather bored by [[Robert Jameson]]'s natural-history course, which covered geology—including the debate between [[Neptunism]] and [[Plutonism]]. He learned the [[alpha taxonomy|classification]] of plants, and assisted with work on the collections of the [[Royal Museum|University Museum]], one of the largest museums in Europe at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's neglect of medical studies annoyed his father, who shrewdly sent him to [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], to study for a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree as the first step towards becoming an Anglican country [[parson]]. As Darwin was unqualified for the ''[[Tripos]]'', he joined the ''ordinary'' degree course in January 1828.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=47–48, 89–91}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb | Desmond |Moore | 2009 | pp=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; He preferred [[equestrianism|riding]] and [[shooting sports|shooting]] to studying. His cousin [[William Darwin Fox]] introduced him to the popular craze for [[beetle]] collecting; Darwin pursued this zealously, getting some of his finds published in [[James Francis Stephens]]' ''Illustrations of British entomology''. He became a close friend and follower of botany professor [[John Stevens Henslow]] and met other leading [[parson-naturalist]]s who saw scientific work as religious [[natural theology]], becoming known to these [[University don|dons]] as "the man who walks with Henslow". When his own exams drew near, Darwin applied himself to his studies and was delighted by the language and logic of [[William Paley]]'s ''Evidences of Christianity''&lt;ref name=dar57&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 73–79}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=59 57–67]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1794). In his final examination in January 1831 Darwin did well, coming tenth out of 178 candidates for the ''ordinary'' degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin had to stay at Cambridge until June 1831. He studied Paley's ''[[Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity]]'' (first published in 1802), which made an [[teleological argument|argument for divine design in nature]], explaining [[adaptation]] as God acting through [[Physical law|laws of nature]].&lt;ref name="syd5-7"&gt;{{Harvnb|von Sydow|2005|pp=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He read [[John Herschel]]'s new book, ''Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy'' (1831), which described the highest aim of [[natural philosophy]] as understanding such laws through [[inductive reasoning]] based on observation, and [[Alexander von Humboldt]]'s ''Personal Narrative'' of scientific travels in 1799–1804. Inspired with "a burning zeal" to contribute, Darwin planned to visit [[Tenerife]] with some classmates after graduation to study natural history in the [[tropics]]. In preparation, he joined [[Adam Sedgwick]]'s [[geology]] course, then on 4 August travelled with him to spend a fortnight mapping [[strata]] in [[Wales]].&lt;ref name=db&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=69 67–68]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=128–129, 133–141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Survey voyage on HMS ''Beagle''===
{{details|Second voyage of HMS Beagle}}
[[File:Voyage of the Beagle-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|alt=Route from Plymouth, England, south to Cape Verde then southwest across the Atlantic to Bahia, Brazil, south to Rio de Janeiro, Montevideo, the Falkland Islands, round the tip of South America then north to Valparaiso and Callao.

After leaving Sedgwick in Wales, Darwin spent a week with student friends at [[Barmouth]], then returned home on 29 August to find a letter from Henslow proposing him as a suitable (if unfinished) [[natural history|naturalist]] for a self-funded [[wikt:supernumerary|supernumerary]] place on {{HMS|Beagle}} with captain [[Robert FitzRoy]], emphasising that this was a position for a [[gentleman]] rather than "a mere collector". The ship was to leave in four weeks on an expedition to chart the coastline of South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-105.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 105&amp;nbsp;– Henslow, J.

After delays, the voyage began on 27 December 1831; it lasted almost five years. As FitzRoy had intended, Darwin spent most of that time on land investigating geology and making natural history collections, while HMS ''Beagle'' [[hydrography|surveyed and charted]] coasts.&lt;ref name=JvW /&gt;&lt;ref name=kix&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2000|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1840&amp;pageseq=12 ix–xi]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept careful notes of his observations and theoretical speculations, and at intervals during the voyage his specimens were sent to Cambridge together with letters including a copy of [[The Voyage of the Beagle|his journal]] for his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008b|pp=18–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had some expertise in geology, beetle collecting and dissecting [[marine invertebrates]], but in all other areas was a novice and ably collected specimens for expert appraisal.&lt;ref name=fnGal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_Keynes_Galapagos.html|title=Darwin's field notes on the Galapagos: 'A little world within itself'|author=Gordon Chancellor|author2=[[Randal Keynes]]|date=October 2006|publisher=[[Darwin Online]]|accessdate=16 September 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/617qybOGZ?url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_Keynes_Galapagos.html|archivedate=22 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite suffering badly from seasickness, Darwin wrote copious notes while on board the ship. Most of his zoology notes are about marine invertebrates, starting with [[plankton]] collected in a calm spell.&lt;ref name=kix /&gt;&lt;ref name=plankton&gt;{{Harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1925&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=53 21–22]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On their first stop ashore at [[Santiago, Cape Verde|St Jago]] in [[Cape Verde]], Darwin found that a white band high in the [[volcanic rock]] cliffs included seashells. FitzRoy had given him the first volume of [[Charles Lyell]]'s ''Principles of Geology'', which set out [[uniformitarian]] concepts of land slowly rising or falling over immense periods,{{Ref label|B|II|none}} and Darwin saw things Lyell's way, theorising and thinking of writing a book on geology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=183–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When they reached [[Brazil]], Darwin was delighted by the [[Bahia coastal forests|tropical forest]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=73 41–42]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but detested the sight of [[slavery]], and disputed this issue with Fitzroy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=75 73–74]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The survey continued to the south in [[Patagonia]]. They stopped at [[Bahía Blanca]], and in cliffs near [[Punta Alta]] Darwin made a major find of fossil bones of huge extinct [[mammal]]s beside modern seashells, indicating recent [[extinction]] with no signs of change in climate or catastrophe. He identified the little-known ''[[Megatherium]]'' by a tooth and its association with bony armour, which had at first seemed to him to be like a giant version of the armour on local [[armadillo]]s. The finds brought great interest when they reached England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp= 223–235}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1835|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=7 7]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=k206&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=138 206–209]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On rides with [[gaucho]]s into the interior to explore geology and collect more fossils, Darwin gained social, political and [[anthropology|anthropological]] insights into both native and colonial people at a time of revolution, and learnt that two types of [[rhea (bird)|rhea]] had separate but overlapping territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 189–192, 198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eldredge|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further south, he saw stepped plains of shingle and seashells as [[raised beach]]es showing a series of elevations. He read Lyell's second volume and accepted its view of "centres of creation" of species, but his discoveries and theorising challenged Lyell's ideas of smooth continuity and of extinction of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 131, 159}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Herbert|1991|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A342&amp;pageseq=16 174–179]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HurrahChiloe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.8.html|title=Darwin Online: 'Hurrah Chiloe': an introduction to the Port Desire Notebook|accessdate=24 October 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/617qzBb03?url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.8.html|archivedate=22 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three Fuegians on board had been seized during the [[HMS Beagle#First voyage|first ''Beagle'' voyage]], then during a year in England were educated as missionaries. Darwin found them friendly and civilised, yet at [[Tierra del Fuego]] he met "miserable, degraded savages", as different as wild from domesticated animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1845|pp= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F14&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=218 205–208]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained convinced that, despite this diversity, all humans were interrelated with [[Monogenism|a shared origin]] and potential for improvement towards civilisation. Unlike his scientist friends, he now thought there was no unbridgeable gap between humans and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp= 243–244, 248–250, 382–383}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year on, the mission had been abandoned. The Fuegian they had named [[Jemmy Button]] lived like the other natives, had a wife, and had no wish to return to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=258 226–227]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin experienced [[1835 Concepción earthquake|an earthquake in Chile]] and saw signs that the land had just been raised, including [[mussel]]-beds stranded above high tide. High in the [[Andes]] he saw seashells, and several fossil trees that had grown on a sand beach. He theorised that as the land rose, [[island|oceanic islands]] sank, and [[coral reef]]s round them grew to form [[atoll]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 160–168, 182}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1887|p= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1452.1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=278 260]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=atolls&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|loc=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1497&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=100 pp. 98–99]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the geologically new [[Galápagos Islands]], Darwin looked for evidence attaching wildlife to an older "centre of creation", and found [[mockingbird]]s allied to those in Chile but differing from island to island. He heard that slight variations in the shape of [[tortoise]] shells showed which island they came from, but failed to collect them, even after eating tortoises taken on board as food.&lt;ref name=k356&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=388 356–357]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sulloway|1982|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, the [[marsupial]] [[Potoridae|rat-kangaroo]] and the [[platypus]] seemed so unusual that Darwin thought it was almost as though two distinct Creators had been at work.&lt;ref name=Crows&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.3.html|title=Darwin Online: Coccatoos &amp; Crows: An introduction to the Sydney Notebook|accessdate=2 January 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114015611/http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.3.html|archivedate=14 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found the [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]] "good-humoured &amp; pleasant", and noted their depletion by European settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=430 398–399].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FitzRoy investigated how the atolls of the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]] had formed, and the survey supported Darwin's theorising.&lt;ref name=atolls /&gt; FitzRoy began writing the official ''Narrative'' of the ''Beagle'' voyages, and after reading Darwin's diary he proposed incorporating it into the account.&lt;ref name=Letter301&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-301.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 301&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.R. to Darwin, C.S., 29 Apr 1836|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/617qzmWSB?url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-301|archivedate=22 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle|Journal]]'' was eventually rewritten as a separate third volume, on natural history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|p= 336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Cape Town]], Darwin and FitzRoy met [[John Herschel]], who had recently written to Lyell praising his [[uniformitarianism]] as opening bold speculation on "that mystery of mysteries, the replacement of extinct species by others" as "a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process".&lt;ref name=Rascals&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2007|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A544&amp;pageseq=21 197]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When organising his notes as the ship sailed home, Darwin wrote that, if his growing suspicions about the mockingbirds, the tortoises and the [[Falkland Islands wolf|Falkland Islands fox]] were correct, "such facts undermine the stability of Species", then cautiously added "would" before "undermine".&lt;ref name=xix&gt;{{Harvnb|Keynes|2000|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1840&amp;pageseq=22 xix–xx]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Eldredge|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later wrote that such facts "seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=16 p. 1]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inception of Darwin's evolutionary theory===

Portrait by [[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]].]]

When the ship reached [[Falmouth, Cornwall]], on 2 October 1836, Darwin was already a celebrity in scientific circles as in December 1835 [[John Stevens Henslow|Henslow]] had fostered his former pupil's reputation by giving selected naturalists a pamphlet of Darwin's geological letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1835|loc=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Freeman_LettersOnGeology.html editorial introduction]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin visited his home in Shrewsbury and saw relatives, then hurried to [[Cambridge]] to see Henslow, who advised him on finding naturalists available to catalogue the collections and agreed to take on the botanical specimens. Darwin's father organised investments, enabling his son to be a self-funded [[gentleman scientist]], and an excited Darwin went round the London institutions being fêted and seeking experts to describe the collections. Zoologists had a huge backlog of work, and there was a danger of specimens just being left in storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 195–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Lyell]] eagerly met Darwin for the first time on 29 October and soon introduced him to the up-and-coming anatomist [[Richard Owen]], who had the facilities of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] to work on the fossil bones collected by Darwin. Owen's surprising results included other gigantic extinct [[ground sloth]]s as well as the ''[[Megatherium]]'', a near complete skeleton of the unknown ''[[Scelidotherium]]'' and a [[hippopotamus]]-sized [[rodent]]-like skull named ''[[Toxodon]]'' resembling a giant [[capybara]]. The armour fragments were actually from ''[[Glyptodon]]'', a huge armadillo-like creature as Darwin had initially thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Owen|1840|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F9.1&amp;pageseq=26 16], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F9.1&amp;pageseq=83 73], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F9.1&amp;pageseq=116 106]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Eldredge|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=k206 /&gt; These extinct creatures were related to living species in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 201–205}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=349–350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-December, Darwin took lodgings in Cambridge to organise work on his collections and rewrite his ''Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=345–347}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote his first paper, showing that the South American landmass was slowly rising, and with Lyell's enthusiastic backing read it to the [[Geological Society of London]] on 4 January 1837. On the same day, he presented his mammal and bird specimens to the [[Zoological Society of London|Zoological Society]]. The ornithologist [[John Gould]] soon announced that the Galapagos birds that Darwin had thought a mixture of [[Common blackbird|blackbirds]], "[[Grosbeak|gros-beaks]]" and [[finch]]es, were, in fact, twelve [[Darwin's finches|separate species of finches]]. On 17 February, Darwin was elected to the Council of the Geological Society, and Lyell's presidential address presented Owen's findings on Darwin's fossils, stressing geographical continuity of species as supporting his uniformitarian ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 207–210}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Sulloway|1982|pp=20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in March, Darwin moved to London to be near this work, joining Lyell's social circle of scientists and [[expert]]s such as [[Charles Babbage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-346.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 346&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.

Darwin stayed with his [[freethought|freethinking]] brother [[Erasmus Alvey Darwin|Erasmus]], part of this [[British Whig Party|Whig]] circle and a close friend of the writer [[Harriet Martineau]], who promoted [[Malthusianism]] underlying the controversial Whig [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|Poor Law reforms]] to stop welfare from causing overpopulation and more poverty. As a Unitarian, she welcomed the [[radicalism (historical)|radical]] implications of [[transmutation of species]], promoted by [[Robert Edmond Grant|Grant]] and younger surgeons influenced by [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Geoffroy]]. Transmutation was anathema to Anglicans defending social order,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=201, 212–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; but reputable scientists openly discussed the subject and there was wide interest in [[John Herschel]]'s letter praising Lyell's approach as a way to find a [[Physical law|natural cause]] of the origin of new species.&lt;ref name=Rascals /&gt;

Gould met Darwin and told him that the Galápagos [[mockingbird]]s from different islands were separate species, not just varieties, and what Darwin had thought was a "[[wren]]" was also [[Warbler-finch|in the finch group]]. Darwin had not labelled the finches by island, but from the notes of others on the ship, including FitzRoy, he allocated species to islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sulloway|1982|pp=9, 20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two [[rhea (bird)|rheas]] were also distinct species, and on 14 March Darwin announced how their distribution changed going southwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|p=360}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1643&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1|title=Darwin, C.

By mid-March, Darwin was speculating in his ''Red Notebook'' on the possibility that "one species does change into another" to explain the geographical distribution of living species such as the rheas, and extinct ones such as the strange ''[[Macrauchenia]]'', which resembled a giant [[guanaco]]. His thoughts on lifespan, [[asexual reproduction]] and [[sexual reproduction]] developed in his "B" notebook around mid-July on to variation in offspring "to adapt &amp; alter the race to ''changing'' world" explaining the [[Galápagos tortoise]]s, mockingbirds and rheas. He sketched branching descent, then a [[genealogy|genealogical]] branching of a single [[tree of life (science)|evolutionary tree]], in which "It is absurd to talk of one animal being higher than another", discarding Lamarck's independent [[lineage (evolution)|lineages]] progressing to higher forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Herbert|1980|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1583e&amp;pageseq=9 7–10]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008b|p=44}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1837|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR121.-&amp;pageseq=1 1–13, 26, 36, 74]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=229–232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overwork, illness, and marriage===
{{See also|Charles Darwin's health}}
While developing this intensive study of [[transmutation of species|transmutation]], Darwin became mired in more work. Still rewriting his ''Journal'', he took on editing and publishing the expert reports on his collections, and with Henslow's help obtained a Treasury grant of [[pound sterling|£]]1,000 to sponsor this multi-volume ''[[Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle]]'', a sum equivalent to about £{{formatnum:{{inflation|UK|1000|1837|r=-3}}}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-2}}.{{inflation-fn|UK}} He stretched the funding to include his planned books on geology, and agreed to unrealistic dates with the publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=367–369}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Victorian era]] began, Darwin pressed on with writing his ''Journal'', and in August 1837 began correcting [[Galley proof|printer's proofs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=21 xix]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's health suffered under the pressure. On 20 September he had "an uncomfortable palpitation of the heart", so his doctors urged him to "knock off all work" and live in the country for a few weeks. After visiting Shrewsbury he joined his Wedgwood relatives at [[Maer Hall]], Staffordshire, but found them too eager for tales of his travels to give him much rest. His charming, intelligent, and cultured cousin [[Emma Darwin|Emma Wedgwood]], nine months older than Darwin, was nursing his invalid aunt. His uncle [[Josiah Wedgwood II|Josiah]] pointed out an area of ground where cinders had disappeared under [[loam]] and suggested that this might have been the work of [[earthworm]]s, inspiring "a new &amp; important theory" on their role in [[pedogenesis|soil formation]], which Darwin presented at the Geological Society on 1 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 233–234}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-404.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 404&amp;nbsp;– Buckland, William to Geological Society of London, 9 Mar 1838|accessdate=23 December 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629192234/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-404.html|archivedate=29 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Whewell]] pushed Darwin to take on the duties of Secretary of the Geological Society. After initially declining the work, he accepted the post in March 1838.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 233–236}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the grind of writing and editing the ''Beagle'' reports, Darwin made remarkable progress on transmutation, taking every opportunity to question expert naturalists and, unconventionally, people with practical experience such as farmers and [[pigeon keeping|pigeon fanciers]].&lt;ref name=JvW /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 241–244, 426}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, his research drew on information from his relatives and children, the family butler, neighbours, colonists and former shipmates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|p=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; He included mankind in his speculations from the outset, and on seeing an [[orangutan]] in the zoo on 28 March 1838 noted its childlike behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 241–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Emma Darwin.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Three quarter length portrait of woman aged about 30, with dark hair in centre parting straight on top, then falling in curls on each side. She smiles pleasantly and is wearing an open necked blouse with a large shawl pulled over her arms|Darwin chose to marry his cousin, [[Emma Darwin|Emma Wedgwood]].]]
The strain took a toll, and by June he was being laid up for days on end with stomach problems, headaches and heart symptoms. For the rest of his life, he was repeatedly incapacitated with episodes of stomach pains, vomiting, severe [[boil]]s, palpitations, trembling and other symptoms, particularly during times of stress, such as attending meetings or making social visits. The cause of [[Charles Darwin's illness|Darwin's illness]] remained unknown, and attempts at treatment had little success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 252, 476, 531}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=119 115]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 June, he took a break and went "geologising" in Scotland. He visited [[Glen Roy]] in glorious weather to see the parallel "roads" cut into the hillsides at three heights. He later published his view that these were marine [[raised beach]]es, but then had to accept that they were shorelines of a [[proglacial lake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 254}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=377–378}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=86 84]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fully recuperated, he returned to Shrewsbury in July. Used to jotting down daily notes on animal breeding, he scrawled rambling thoughts about career and prospects on two scraps of paper, one with columns headed ''"Marry"'' and ''"Not Marry"''. Advantages included "constant companion and a friend in old age&amp;nbsp;... better than a dog anyhow", against points such as "less money for books" and "terrible loss of time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1497&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=238 232–233]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having decided in favour, he discussed it with his father, then went to visit Emma on 29 July. He did not get around to proposing, but against his father's advice he mentioned his ideas on transmutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=256–259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Malthus and natural selection====
Continuing his research in London, Darwin's wide reading now included the sixth edition of [[Thomas Malthus|Malthus]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'', and on 28 September 1838 he noted its assertion that human "population, when unchecked, goes on doubling itself every twenty five years, or increases in a geometrical ratio", a [[geometric progression]] so that population soon exceeds food supply in what is known as a [[Malthusian catastrophe]]. Darwin was well prepared to compare this to [[A. P. de Candolle|de Candolle]]'s "warring of the species" of plants and the struggle for existence among wildlife, explaining how numbers of a species kept roughly stable. As species always breed beyond available resources, favourable variations would make organisms better at surviving and passing the variations on to their offspring, while unfavourable variations would be lost. He wrote that the "final cause of all this wedging, must be to sort out proper structure, &amp; adapt it to changes", so that "One may say there is a force like a hundred thousand wedges trying force into every kind of adapted structure into the gaps of in the economy of nature, or rather forming gaps by thrusting out weaker ones."&lt;ref name=JvW /&gt;&lt;ref name="134e"&gt;{{cite web | title = Darwin transmutation notebook D pp. 134e–135e | url = http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR123.-&amp;pageseq=112 | accessdate = 4 June 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120718105154/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR123.-&amp;pageseq=112 | archivedate = 18 July 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This would result in the formation of new species.&lt;ref name=JvW /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 264–265}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp= 385–388}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1842|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1556&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=39 7]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he later wrote in his ''[[The Autobiography of Charles Darwin|Autobiography]]''''':'''

{{Quote|In October 1838, that is, fifteen months after I had begun my systematic enquiry, I happened to read for amusement Malthus on Population, and being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which everywhere goes on from long-continued observation of the habits of animals and plants, it at once struck me that under these circumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones to be destroyed. The result of this would be the formation of new species. Here, then, I had at last got a theory by which to work..."&lt;ref name="autobio 120"&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=124 120]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By mid December, Darwin saw a similarity between farmers picking the best stock in [[selective breeding]], and a Malthusian Nature selecting from chance variants so that "every part of newly acquired structure is fully practical and perfected",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR124.-&amp;pageseq=63 |title=Darwin transmutation notebook E p. 75 |accessdate=17 March 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628082830/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR124.-&amp;pageseq=63 |archivedate=28 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; thinking this comparison "a beautiful part of my theory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR124.-&amp;pageseq=61|title=Darwin transmutation notebook E p. 71|accessdate=17 March 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628080656/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR124.-&amp;pageseq=61|archivedate=28 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later called his theory [[natural selection]], an analogy with what he termed the [[artificial selection]] of selective breeding.&lt;ref name=JvW /&gt;

On 11 November, he returned to Maer and proposed to Emma, once more telling her his ideas. She accepted, then in exchanges of loving letters she showed how she valued his openness in sharing their differences, also expressing her strong Unitarian beliefs and concerns that his honest doubts might separate them in the afterlife.&lt;ref name=Belief&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/content/view/130/125/|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Belief: historical essay|accessdate=25 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225124103/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/content/view/130/125/ |archivedate=25 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was house-hunting in London, bouts of illness continued and Emma wrote urging him to get some rest, almost prophetically remarking "So don't be ill any more my dear Charley till I can be with you to nurse you." He found what they called "Macaw Cottage" (because of its gaudy interiors) in [[Gower Street (London)|Gower Street]], then moved his "museum" in over Christmas. On 24 January 1839, Darwin was [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1839|elected a Fellow of the Royal Society]] (FRS).&lt;ref name=frs /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 272–279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 January, Darwin and Emma Wedgwood were married at Maer in an Anglican ceremony arranged to suit the Unitarians, then immediately caught the train to London and their new home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When FitzRoy's ''Narrative'' was published in May 1839, Darwin's ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle|Journal and Remarks]]'' was such a success as the third volume that later that year it was published on its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1887|loc=[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=39003&amp;pageno=32 p. 32.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 1842, Darwin wrote about his ideas to [[Charles Lyell]], who noted that his ally "denies seeing a beginning to each crop of species".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's book ''[[The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs]]'' on his theory of [[atoll]] formation was published in May 1842 after more than three years of work, and he then wrote his first "pencil sketch" of his theory of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=292–293}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1842|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1556&amp;pageseq=18 xvi–xvii]}}&lt;/ref&gt; To escape the pressures of London, the family moved to rural [[Down House]] in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=118 114]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 January 1844, Darwin mentioned his theorising to the botanist [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]], writing with melodramatic humour "it is like confessing a murder".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2007|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A544&amp;pageseq=7 183–184]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-729.html#back-mark-729.f6|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 729&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.

Darwin completed his third geological book in 1846. He now renewed a fascination and expertise in [[marine invertebrates]], dating back to his student days with [[Robert Edmond Grant|Grant]], by dissecting and classifying the [[barnacle]]s he had collected on the voyage, enjoying observing beautiful structures and thinking about comparisons with allied structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2007|pp=190–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, Hooker read the "Essay" and sent notes that provided Darwin with the calm critical feedback that he needed, but would not commit himself and questioned Darwin's opposition to continuing acts of [[creation myth|creation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 320–323, 339–348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to improve his chronic ill health, Darwin went in 1849 to Dr. [[James Manby Gully|James Gully]]'s [[Great Malvern|Malvern]] spa and was surprised to find some benefit from [[hydrotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-1236.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 1236&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.

In eight years of work on [[barnacle]]s (Cirripedia), Darwin's theory helped him to find "[[homology (biology)|homologies]]" showing that slightly changed body parts served different functions to meet new conditions, and in some [[genus|genera]] he found minute males [[parasitism|parasitic]] on [[hermaphrodite]]s, showing an [[Androdioecy|intermediate stage]] in evolution of [[Gonochorism|distinct sexes]].&lt;ref name=barlowbio117&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=121 117–118]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853, it earned him the [[Royal Society]]'s Royal Medal, and it made his reputation as a [[biology|biologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 383–387}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854 he became a Fellow of the [[Linnean Society of London]], gaining postal access to its library.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|2007|pp=107, 109}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began a major reassessment of his theory of species, and in November realised that divergence in the character of descendants could be explained by them becoming adapted to "diversified places in the economy of nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 419–420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publication of the theory of natural selection===

By the start of 1856, Darwin was investigating whether eggs and [[seed]]s could survive travel across seawater to spread species across oceans. [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Hooker]] increasingly doubted the traditional view that species were fixed, but their young friend [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] was firmly against the transmutation of species. [[Charles Lyell|Lyell]] was intrigued by Darwin's speculations without realising their extent. When he read a paper by [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], "On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species", he saw similarities with Darwin's thoughts and urged him to publish to establish precedence. Though Darwin saw no threat, on 14 May 1856 he began writing a short paper. Finding answers to difficult questions held him up repeatedly, and he expanded his plans to a "big book on species" titled ''[[Natural Selection (manuscript)|Natural Selection]]'', which was to include his "note on Man". He continued his researches, [[Correspondence of Charles Darwin|obtaining information]] and specimens from naturalists worldwide including Wallace who was working in [[Borneo]]. In mid-1857 he added a section heading; "Theory applied to Races of Man", but did not add text on this topic. On 5 September 1857, Darwin sent the American botanist [[Asa Gray]] a detailed outline of his ideas, including an abstract of ''Natural Selection'', which omitted [[human evolution|human origins]] and [[sexual selection]]. In December, Darwin received a letter from Wallace asking if the book would examine human origins. He responded that he would avoid that subject, "so surrounded with prejudices", while encouraging Wallace's theorising and adding that "I go much further than you."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 412–441, 457–458, 462–463}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb | Desmond |Moore | 2009 | pp=283–284, 290–292, 295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's book was only partly written when, on 18 June 1858, he received a paper from Wallace describing natural selection. Shocked that he had been "forestalled", Darwin sent it on that day to Lyell, as requested by Wallace,&lt;ref&gt;Ball, P. (2011).

His family was in crisis with children in the village dying of [[scarlet fever]], and he put matters in the hands of his friends. After some discussion, Lyell and Hooker decided on a joint presentation at the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnean Society]] on 1 July of ''[[On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection]]''. On the evening of 28 June, Darwin's baby son died of scarlet fever after almost a week of severe illness, and he was too distraught to attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 466–470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was little immediate attention to this announcement of the theory; the president of the Linnean Society remarked in May 1859 that the year had not been marked by any revolutionary discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=40–42, 48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only one review rankled enough for Darwin to recall it later; Professor [[Samuel Haughton]] of Dublin claimed that "all that was new in them was false, and what was true was old".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1497&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=126 122]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin struggled for thirteen months to produce an abstract of his "big book", suffering from ill health but getting constant encouragement from his scientific friends. Lyell arranged to have it published by [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 374–474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' proved unexpectedly popular, with the entire stock of 1,250 copies oversubscribed when it went on sale to booksellers on 22 November 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 477}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Darwin set out "one long argument" of detailed observations, inferences and consideration of anticipated objections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=477 p. 459]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In making the case for [[common descent]], he included evidence of [[Homology (biology)|homologies]] between humans and other mammals.{{sfn|van Wyhe|2008}}{{Ref label|C|III|none}} Having outlined [[sexual selection]], he hinted that it could explain differences between [[Race (human categorization)|human races]].&lt;ref name=SS_man&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|p= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=217&amp;itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text 199]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb | Darwin |Costa | 2009 | p=199}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb | Desmond |Moore | 2009 | p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|D|IV|1}} He avoided explicit discussion of human origins, but implied the significance of his work with the sentence; "Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history."&lt;ref name="light on man"&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=506 488]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb | Darwin |Costa | 2009 | pp=199, 488}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|D|IV|2}} His theory is simply stated in the introduction:
{{quotation|As many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be ''naturally selected''. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=20 p. 5]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the end of the book he concluded that:
{{quotation|There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=508 p. 492]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The last word was the only variant of "evolved" in the first five editions of the book. "[[Evolutionism]]" at that time was associated with other concepts, most commonly with [[Prenatal development (biology)|embryological development]], and Darwin first used the word [[evolution]] in ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'' in 1871, before adding it in 1872 to the 6th edition of ''The Origin of Species''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|p=59}}, {{harvnb|Freeman|1977|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=80&amp;itemID=A1&amp;viewtype=text 79–80]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book aroused international interest, with less controversy than had greeted the popular ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2008b|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Darwin's illness kept him away from the public debates, he eagerly scrutinised the scientific response, commenting on press cuttings, reviews, articles, satires and caricatures, and [[Correspondence of Charles Darwin|corresponded on it]] with colleagues worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=103–104, 379}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book did not explicitly discuss human origins,&lt;ref name="light on man" /&gt;{{Ref label|D|IV|3}} but included a number of hints about the animal ancestry of humans from which the inference could be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Radick|2013|pp=174–175}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Huxley|Kettlewell|1965|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first review asked, "If a monkey has become a man–what may not a man become?" and said it should be left to theologians as it was too dangerous for ordinary readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|p=87}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Leifchild|1859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst early favourable responses, Huxley's reviews swiped at [[Richard Owen]], leader of the scientific establishment Huxley was trying to overthrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=477–491}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April, Owen's review attacked Darwin's friends and condescendingly dismissed his ideas, angering Darwin,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=110–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Owen and others began to promote ideas of supernaturally guided evolution. [[Patrick Matthew]] drew attention to his 1831 book which had a brief appendix suggesting a concept of natural selection leading to new species, but he had not developed the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=158, 186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Church of England]]'s response was mixed. Darwin's old Cambridge tutors [[Adam Sedgwick|Sedgwick]] and [[John Stevens Henslow|Henslow]] dismissed the ideas, but [[liberal Christianity|liberal clergymen]] interpreted natural selection as an instrument of God's design, with the cleric [[Charles Kingsley]] seeing it as "just as noble a conception of Deity".&lt;ref name=Darwinanddesign&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/content/view/110/104/|title=Darwin and design: historical essay|year=2007|publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project|accessdate=17 September 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615191012/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/content/view/110/104/ |archivedate=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860, the publication of ''[[Essays and Reviews]]'' by seven liberal Anglican theologians diverted [[clergy|clerical]] attention from Darwin, with its ideas including [[higher criticism]] attacked by church authorities as [[heresy]]. In it, [[Baden Powell (mathematician)|Baden Powell]] argued that [[miracle]]s broke God's laws, so belief in them was [[atheism|atheistic]], and praised "Mr Darwin's masterly volume &amp;#91;supporting&amp;#93; the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 487–488, 500}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asa Gray]] discussed [[teleology]] with Darwin, who imported and distributed Gray's pamphlet on [[theistic evolution]], ''Natural Selection is not inconsistent with [[natural theology]]''.&lt;ref name=Darwinanddesign /&gt;&lt;ref name=miles&gt;{{Harvnb|Miles|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous confrontation was at the public [[1860 Oxford evolution debate]] during a meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], where the [[Bishop of Oxford]] [[Samuel Wilberforce]], though not opposed to [[transmutation of species]], argued against Darwin's explanation and human descent from apes. [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]] argued strongly for Darwin, and [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Thomas Huxley]]'s legendary retort, that he would rather be descended from an ape than a man who misused his gifts, came to symbolise a triumph of science over religion.&lt;ref name=Darwinanddesign /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even Darwin's close friends Gray, Hooker, Huxley and Lyell still expressed various reservations but gave strong support, as did many others, particularly younger naturalists. Gray and Lyell sought reconciliation with faith, while Huxley portrayed a polarisation between religion and science. He campaigned pugnaciously against the authority of the clergy in education,&lt;ref name=Darwinanddesign /&gt; aiming to overturn the dominance of clergymen and aristocratic amateurs under Owen in favour of a new generation of professional scientists. Owen's claim that brain anatomy proved humans to be a separate [[order (biology)|biological order]] from apes was shown to be false by Huxley in a long running dispute parodied by Kingsley as the "[[Great Hippocampus Question]]", and discredited Owen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=156–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Darwinism]] became a movement covering a wide range of evolutionary ideas. In 1863 [[Charles Lyell|Lyell]]'s ''[[Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man]]'' popularised prehistory, though his caution on evolution disappointed Darwin. Weeks later Huxley's ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]'' showed that anatomically, humans are apes, then ''[[The Naturalist on the River Amazons]]'' by [[Henry Walter Bates]] provided empirical evidence of natural selection.&lt;ref name=B217&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=217–226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lobbying brought Darwin Britain's highest scientific honour, the [[Royal Society]]'s [[Copley Medal]], awarded on 3 November 1864.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-4652.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Letter 4652&amp;nbsp;– Falconer, Hugh to Darwin, C.

The ''Origin of Species'' was translated into many languages, becoming a staple scientific text attracting thoughtful attention from all walks of life, including the "working men" who flocked to Huxley's lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=507–508}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=128–129, 138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's theory also resonated with various movements at the time{{Ref label|E|V|none}} and became a key fixture of popular culture.{{Ref label|F|VI|none}} Cartoonists parodied animal ancestry in an old tradition of showing humans with animal traits, and in Britain these droll images served to popularise Darwin's theory in an unthreatening way.

Despite repeated bouts of illness during the last twenty-two years of his life, Darwin's work continued. Having published ''On the Origin of Species'' as an [[abstract (summary)|abstract]] of his theory, he pressed on with experiments, research, and writing of his "big book". He covered [[human evolution|human descent]] from earlier animals including evolution of society and of mental abilities, as well as explaining decorative beauty in wildlife and diversifying into innovative plant studies.

Enquiries about insect [[pollination]] led in 1861 to novel studies of wild [[orchid]]s, showing adaptation of their flowers to [[Pollination syndrome|attract specific moths]] to each species and ensure [[heterosis|cross fertilisation]]. In 1862 ''[[Fertilisation of Orchids]]'' gave his first detailed demonstration of the power of natural selection to explain complex ecological relationships, making testable predictions. As his health declined, he lay on his sickbed in a room filled with inventive experiments to trace the movements of [[vine|climbing plants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2008b|pp=50–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admiring visitors included [[Ernst Haeckel]], a zealous proponent of ''Darwinismus'' incorporating [[Lamarckism]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s idealism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/correspondence-volume-14 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-06 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605110511/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/correspondence-volume-14 |archivedate=5 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }} Cambridge University Press.

Darwin's book ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'' (1868) was the first part of his planned "big book", and included his unsuccessful hypothesis of [[pangenesis]] attempting to explain [[heredity]]. It sold briskly at first, despite its size, and was translated into many languages. He wrote most of a second part, on natural selection, but it remained unpublished in his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Freeman|1977|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A1&amp;pageseq=123 122]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Lyell|Lyell]] had already popularised human prehistory, and [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] had shown that anatomically humans are apes.&lt;ref name=B217 /&gt; With ''The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex'' published in 1871, Darwin set out evidence from numerous sources that humans are animals, showing continuity of physical and mental attributes, and presented [[sexual selection]] to explain impractical animal features such as the [[peacock]]'s plumage as well as human evolution of culture, differences between sexes, and physical and cultural [[Race (human categorization)|racial classification]], while emphasising that humans are all one species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F937.2&amp;pageseq=402 385–405]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=339–343}}&lt;/ref&gt; His research using images was expanded in his 1872 book ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'', one of the first books to feature printed photographs, which discussed the [[evolutionary psychology|evolution of human psychology]] and its continuity with the [[ethology|behaviour of animals]]. Both books proved very popular, and Darwin was impressed by the general assent with which his views had been received, remarking that "everybody is talking about it without being shocked."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=359–369}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1887|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1452.3&amp;pageseq=145 133]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His conclusion was "that man with all his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most debased, with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to the humblest living creature, with his god-like intellect which has penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar system—with all these exalted powers—Man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.2&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=422 405]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His evolution-related experiments and investigations led to books on Orchids, ''[[Insectivorous Plants (book)|Insectivorous Plants]], [[The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom]]'', different forms of flowers on plants of the same species, and ''[[The Power of Movement in Plants]]''. His botanical work was interpreted and popularised by various writers including [[Grant Allen]] and [[H. G. Wells]], and [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=10359900&amp;fulltextType=RA&amp;fileId=S0007087416000352 helped transform plant science] in the late 19th century and early 20th century.

Portrait by [[John Collier (Pre-Raphaelite painter)|John Collier]] in the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]].]]
By the time of his death, Darwin had convinced most scientists that [[evolution]] as [[common descent|descent with modification]] was correct, and he was regarded as a great scientist who had revolutionised ideas. In June 1909, though few at that time agreed with his view that "natural selection has been the main but not the exclusive means of modification", he was honoured by more than 400 officials and scientists from across the world who met in [[Cambridge]] to [[Darwin Day|commemorate his centenary]] and the fiftieth anniversary of ''On the Origin of Species''.&lt;ref name=b222&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=222–225}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008}}&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1872|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F391&amp;pageseq=449 421]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the beginning of the 20th century, a period that has been called "[[the eclipse of Darwinism]]", scientists proposed various alternative evolutionary mechanisms, which eventually proved untenable. [[Ronald Fisher]], an English [[statistics|statistician]], finally united [[Mendelian genetics]] with natural selection, in the period between 1918 and his 1930 book ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genetics.org/content/154/4/1419.full The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection An introduction to the book by [[A.

A life-size seated statue of Darwin can be seen in the main hall of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/about-us/news/2008/may/darwins-statue-on-the-move13846.html|title=Darwin's statue on the move|date=23 May 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205015506/http://www.nhm.ac.uk/about-us/news/2008/may/darwins-statue-on-the-move13846.html|archivedate=5 December 2011|publisher=Natural History Museum|accessdate=7 February 2012|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A seated statue of Darwin, unveiled 1897, stands in front of [[Shrewsbury Library]], the building that used to house [[Shrewsbury School]], which Darwin attended as a boy. Another statue of Darwin as a young man is situated in the grounds of [[Christ's College, Cambridge]].

[[Darwin College, Cambridge|Darwin College]], a postgraduate college at [[Cambridge University]], is named after the Darwin family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kent.ac.uk/maps/canterbury/canterbury-campus/building/darwin-college|title=Darwin College – Maps and directions – University of Kent|website=www.kent.ac.uk|access-date=2016-10-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031024930/https://www.kent.ac.uk/maps/canterbury/canterbury-campus/building/darwin-college|archivedate=31 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2008-09 the Swedish band [[The Knife]], in collaboration with Danish performance group Hotel Pro Forma and other musicians from Denmark, Sweden and the USA, created an opera about the life of Darwin, and The Origin of Species, titled [[Tomorrow, in a Year]]. The show toured European theatres in 2010.

The Darwins had ten children: two died in infancy, and [[Anne Darwin|Annie]]'s death at the age of ten had a devastating effect on her parents. Charles was a devoted father and uncommonly attentive to his children.&lt;ref name=whowas /&gt; Whenever they fell ill, he feared that they might have inherited weaknesses from [[inbreeding]] due to the close family ties he shared with his [[cousin marriage|wife and cousin]], Emma Wedgwood.

He examined inbreeding in his writings, contrasting it with the advantages of [[outcrossing]] in many species.{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=447}} Despite his fears, most of the surviving children and many of their descendants went on to have distinguished careers.

Of his surviving children, [[George Darwin|George]], [[Francis Darwin|Francis]] and [[Horace Darwin|Horace]] became [[Fellow of the Royal Society|Fellows of the Royal Society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Fellows of the Royal Society, 1660–2006, A–J|url=http://royalsociety.org/trackdoc.asp?id=4274&amp;pId=1727|accessdate=2009-09-16|df=dmy-all|format=PDF|archivedate=2017-02-03|dead-url=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203000229/https://royalsociety.org/trackdoc.asp?id=4274&amp;pId=1727}}&lt;/ref&gt; distinguished as astronomer,&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Darwin}}&lt;/ref&gt; botanist and civil engineer, respectively.

==Views and opinions==

===Religious views===
{{Details|Religious views of Charles Darwin}}
[[File:Annie Darwin.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Three quarter length studio photo of seated girl about nine years old, looking slightly plump and rather solemn, in a striped dress, holding a basket of flowers on her lap.|In 1851 Darwin was devastated when his daughter [[Anne Darwin|Annie]] died. By then his faith in Christianity had dwindled, and he had stopped going to church.&lt;ref name=jvw41&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2008b|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Darwin's family tradition was [[nonconformist]] [[Unitarianism]], while his father and grandfather were [[freethought|freethinkers]], and his [[baptism]] and [[boarding school]] were [[Church of England]].&lt;ref name=skool /&gt; When going to Cambridge to become an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] clergyman, he did not doubt the [[Biblical inerrancy|literal truth]] of the Bible.&lt;ref name=dar57 /&gt; He learned [[John Herschel]]'s science which, like [[William Paley]]'s [[natural theology]], sought explanations in laws of nature rather than miracles and saw [[adaptation]] of species as [[teleological argument|evidence of design]].&lt;ref name="syd5-7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=db /&gt; On board HMS ''Beagle'', Darwin was quite [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] and would quote the Bible as an authority on [[morality]].&lt;ref name=biorelig&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1497&amp;viewtype=side&amp;pageseq=87 85–96]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He looked for "centres of creation" to explain distribution,&lt;ref name=k356 /&gt; and suggested that the very similar [[antlion]]s found in Australia and England were evidence of a divine hand.&lt;ref name=Crows /&gt;

By his return, he was [[Historical criticism|critical of the Bible as history]], and wondered why all religions should not be equally valid.&lt;ref name=biorelig /&gt; In the next few years, while intensively speculating on geology and the [[transmutation of species]], he gave much thought to religion and openly discussed this with his wife [[Emma Darwin|Emma]], whose beliefs also came from intensive study and questioning.&lt;ref name=Belief /&gt; The [[theodicy]] of Paley and [[Thomas Malthus]] vindicated evils such as starvation as a result of a benevolent creator's laws, which had an overall good effect. To Darwin, natural selection produced the good of adaptation but removed the need for design,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Sydow|2005|pp=8–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he could not see the work of an omnipotent deity in all the pain and suffering, such as the [[ichneumon wasp]] paralysing [[caterpillar]]s as live food for its eggs.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt; Though he thought of religion as a [[tribe|tribal]] survival strategy, Darwin was reluctant to give up the idea of [[deism|God as an ultimate lawgiver]]. He was increasingly troubled by the [[problem of evil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Sydow|2005|pp=4–5, 12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin remained close friends with the [[Vicar (Anglicanism)|vicar]] of Downe, [[John Brodie Innes]], and continued to play a leading part in the parish work of the church,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/commentary/religion/darwin-and-church |title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;– Darwin and the church: historical essay |accessdate=26 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128133709/https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/commentary/religion/darwin-and-church |archivedate=28 November 2016 |df=dmy-all |date=2015-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but from around 1849 would go for a walk on Sundays while his family attended church.&lt;ref name=jvw41 /&gt; He considered it "absurd to doubt that a man might be an ardent theist and an evolutionist"&lt;ref name=Fordyce&gt;[http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-12041.html Letter 12041] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091107174817/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-12041.html |date=7 November 2009 }}&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.

The "[[Elizabeth Cotton, Lady Hope|Lady Hope Story]]", published in 1915, claimed that Darwin had reverted to Christianity on his sickbed. The claims were repudiated by Darwin's children and have been dismissed as false by historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|2005}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Yates|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human society===
Darwin's views on social and political issues reflected his time and social position. He grew up in a family of [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] reformers who, like his uncle Josiah Wedgwood, supported [[Reform Act 1832|electoral reform]] and the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|emancipation of slaves]]. Darwin was passionately opposed to slavery, while seeing no problem with the working conditions of English factory workers or servants. His taxidermy lessons in 1826 from the freed slave [[John Edmonstone]], who he long recalled as "a very pleasant and intelligent man", reinforced his belief that black people shared the same feelings, and could be as intelligent as people of other races. He took the same attitude to native people he met on the ''Beagle'' voyage.{{sfn|Browne|1995|pp=196–198, 240}} These attitudes were not unusual in Britain in the 1820s, much as it shocked visiting Americans. British society became more racist in mid century,&lt;ref name=eddy /&gt; but Darwin remained strongly against slavery, against "ranking the so-called races of man as distinct species", and against ill-treatment of native people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkins|2008|pp=408–413}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|G|VII|none}} Darwins interaction with [[Yaghan]]s (Fuegians) such as [[Jemmy Button]] during the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle]] had a profound impact on his view of primitive peoples. At his arrival to [[Tierra del Fuego]] he made a colorful description of "[[Fuegian]] savages".&lt;ref name=Rozzi2018/&gt; This view changed as he came to know Yaghan people more in detail. By studying the Yaghans Darwin concluded that a number of basic emotions by different human groups were the same and that mental capabilities were roughly the same as for Europeans.&lt;ref name=Rozzi2018&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rozzi |first1=Ricardo|author-link=Ricardo Rozzi |date=2018 |title=Transformaciones del pensamiento de Darwin en cabo de hornos: Un legado para la ciencia y la etica ambiental|trans-title=Transformations of Darwin’s thought in cape horn: A legacy for science and environmental ethics |language=Spanish |journal=[[Magallania]] |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages= 267–277|doi=10.4067/S0718-22442018000100267 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While interested in Yaghan culture Darwin failed to appreciate their deep ecological knowledge and elaborate cosmology until the 1850s when he inspected a dictionary of [[Yaghan language|Yaghan]] detailing 32-thousand words.&lt;ref name=Rozzi2018/&gt;

He valued European civilisation and saw colonisation as spreading its benefits, with the sad but inevitable effect that savage peoples who did not become civilised faced extinction. Darwin's theories presented this as natural, and were cited to promote policies that went against his humanitarian principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Tony|last=Barta|title=Mr Darwin's shooters: on natural selection and the naturalizing of genocide|url= http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a713721865&amp;fulltext=713240928|journal=Patterns of Prejudice |volume=39|issue=2|pages=116–137 |doi=10.1080/00313220500106170 |date=2 June 2005 |accessdate=20 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He thought men's eminence over women was the outcome of sexual selection, a view disputed by [[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] in her 1875 book ''[[The Sexes Throughout Nature]]''.&lt;ref name=Vandermassen&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vandermassen, Griet |title=Sexual Selection: A Tale of Male Bias and Feminist Denial |url=http://ejw.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/11/1/9 |journal=European Journal of Women's Studies |year=2004 |volume=11 |issue=9 |doi=10.1177/1350506804039812 |accessdate=24 November 2009 |pages=11–13 |ref=harv |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012141736/http://ejw.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/11/1/9 |archivedate=12 October 2008 |df=dmy-all |citeseerx=10.1.1.550.3672 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin was intrigued by his [[Cousin#Additional terms|half-cousin]] [[Francis Galton]]'s argument, introduced in 1865, that [[Historiometry|statistical analysis]] of [[heredity]] showed that moral and mental human traits could be inherited, and principles of animal breeding could apply to humans. In ''The Descent of Man'', Darwin noted that aiding the weak to survive and have families could lose the benefits of natural selection, but cautioned that withholding such aid would endanger the instinct of sympathy, "the noblest part of our nature", and factors such as education could be more important. When Galton suggested that publishing research could encourage intermarriage within a "caste" of "those who are naturally gifted", Darwin foresaw practical difficulties, and thought it "the sole feasible, yet I fear [[utopian]], plan of procedure in improving the human race", preferring to simply publicise the importance of inheritance and leave decisions to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=556–557, 572, 598}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F937.1&amp;pageseq=180 167–173], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F937.2&amp;pageseq=419 402–403]}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galton.org/letters/darwin/correspondence.htm|title=Correspondence between Francis Galton and Charles Darwin|accessdate=8 November 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102150434/http://galton.org/letters/darwin/correspondence.htm|archivedate=2 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis Galton named this field of study "[[eugenics]]" in 1883.{{Ref label|H|VIII|1}}

==Evolutionary social movements==
[[File:VanityFair-Darwin2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Full length portrait of a very thin white bearded Darwin, seated but leaning eagerly forward and smiling.|[[Caricatures of Charles Darwin and his evolutionary theory in 19th-century England|Caricature of Darwin]] from 1871 ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'']]
{{Further|Darwinism|Eugenics|Social Darwinism}}
Darwin's fame and popularity led to his name being associated with ideas and movements that, at times, had only an indirect relation to his writings, and sometimes went directly against his express comments.

[[Thomas Malthus]] had argued that [[Malthusian catastrophe|population growth beyond resources]] was ordained by God to get humans to [[Protestant work ethic|work productively]] and show restraint in getting families, this was used in the 1830s to justify [[workhouse]]s and [[laissez-faire economics]].&lt;ref name=wm&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkins|1997}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution was by then seen as having social implications, and [[Herbert Spencer]]'s 1851 book ''Social Statics'' based ideas of human freedom and individual liberties on his Lamarckian evolutionary theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sweet|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the ''Origin'' was published in 1859, critics derided his description of a struggle for existence as a [[Malthusianism|Malthusian]] justification for the English industrial capitalism of the time. The term ''[[Darwinism]]'' was used for the evolutionary ideas of others, including Spencer's "[[survival of the fittest]]" as free-market progress, and [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s [[polygenism|polygenistic]] ideas of [[Ernst Haeckel#Polygenism and racial theory|human development]]. Writers used natural selection to argue for various, often contradictory, ideologies such as laissez-faire dog-eat dog capitalism, [[colonialism]] and [[New Imperialism|imperialism]]. However, Darwin's holistic view of nature included "dependence of one being on another"; thus [[pacifism|pacifists]], socialists, liberal social reformers and anarchists such as [[Peter Kropotkin]] stressed the value of co-operation over struggle within a species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Paul|2003|pp=223–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin himself insisted that social policy should not simply be guided by concepts of struggle and selection in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bannister|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1880s, a eugenics movement developed on ideas of biological inheritance, and for scientific justification of their ideas appealed to some concepts of Darwinism. In Britain, most shared Darwin's cautious views on voluntary improvement and sought to encourage those with good traits in "positive eugenics". During the "[[Eclipse of Darwinism]]", a scientific foundation for eugenics was provided by [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian]] [[genetics]]. Negative eugenics to remove the "feebleminded" were popular in America, Canada and Australia, and [[eugenics in the United States]] introduced [[compulsory sterilization]] laws, followed by several other countries. Subsequently, [[Nazi eugenics]] brought the field into disrepute.{{Ref label|H|VIII|2}}

The term "[[Social Darwinism]]" was used infrequently from around the 1890s, but became popular as a derogatory term in the 1940s when used by [[Richard Hofstadter]] to attack the laissez-faire conservatism of those like [[William Graham Sumner]] who opposed reform and socialism. Since then, it has been used as a term of abuse by those opposed to what they think are the moral consequences of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Paul|2003}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Kotzin|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wm /&gt;

==Works==
{{details|Charles Darwin bibliography}}

Darwin was a prolific writer. Even without publication of his works on evolution, he would have had a considerable reputation as the author of ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]'', as a geologist who had published extensively on South America and had solved the puzzle of the formation of [[coral atoll]]s, and as a biologist who had published the definitive work on [[barnacle]]s. While ''On the Origin of Species'' dominates perceptions of his work, ''The Descent of Man'' and ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'' had considerable impact, and his books on plants including ''[[The Power of Movement in Plants]]'' were innovative studies of great importance, as was his final work on ''[[The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Balfour|1882}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008}}&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Anonymous|1882}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Brummitt|first = R.

==Notes==
{{refbegin}}
'''{{small|I}}.''' {{Note label|A|I|none}} Darwin was eminent as a [[naturalist]], geologist, [[biologist]], and author. After working as a physician's assistant and two years as a [[medical student]], he was educated as a clergyman; he was also trained in [[taxidermy]].&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|Browne|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{small|II}}.''' {{Note label|B|II|none}} [[Robert FitzRoy]] was to become known after the voyage for [[biblical literalism]], but at this time he had considerable interest in Lyell's ideas, and they met before the voyage when Lyell asked for observations to be made in South America. FitzRoy's diary during the ascent of the River Santa Cruz in [[Patagonia]] recorded his opinion that the plains were [[raised beach]]es, but on return, newly married to a very religious lady, he recanted these ideas.{{Harv|Browne|1995|pp=186, 414}}

'''{{small|III}}.''' {{Note label|C|III|none}} In the section [[Morphology (biology)|"Morphology"]] of Chapter XIII of ''On the Origin of Species'', Darwin commented on [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] bone patterns between humans and other mammals, writing: "What can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include the same bones, in the same relative positions?"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=452&amp;itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text 434]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the concluding chapter: "The framework of bones being the same in the hand of a man, wing of a bat, fin of the porpoise, and leg of the horse … at once explain themselves on the theory of descent with slow and slight successive modifications."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=497&amp;itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text 479]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{small|IV}}.''' {{Note label|D|IV|1}}{{Note label|D|IV|2}}{{Note label|D|IV|3}}
In ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' Darwin mentioned [[human evolution|human origins]] in his concluding remark that "In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches. Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation. Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history."&lt;ref name="light on man" /&gt;

In "Chapter VI: Difficulties on Theory" he referred to [[sexual selection]]: "I might have adduced for this same purpose the differences between the races of man, which are so strongly marked; I may add that some little light can apparently be thrown on the origin of these differences, chiefly through sexual selection of a particular kind, but without here entering on copious details my reasoning would appear frivolous."&lt;ref name=SS_man /&gt;

In ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'' of 1871, Darwin discussed the first passage:
"During many years I collected notes on the origin or descent of man, without any intention of publishing on the subject, but rather with the determination not to publish, as I thought that I should thus only add to the prejudices against my views. It seemed to me sufficient to indicate, in the first edition of my 'Origin of Species,' that by this work 'light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history;' and this implies that man must be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on this earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|p= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=14&amp;itemID=F937.1&amp;viewtype=text 1]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a preface to the 1874 second edition, he added a reference to the second point: "it has been said by several critics, that when I found that many details of structure in man could not be explained through natural selection, I invented sexual selection; I gave, however, a tolerably clear sketch of this principle in the first edition of the 'Origin of Species,' and I there stated that it was applicable to man."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1874|p= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=13&amp;itemID=F944&amp;viewtype=text vi]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marked by the belief that individuals can direct human and social evolution, many progressives came to view education as the panacea for advancing social progress and for solving such problems as urbanisation, poverty, or immigration."

'''{{small|VI}}.''' {{Note label|F|VI|none}} See, for example, the song "A lady fair of lineage high" from [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[Princess Ida]]'', which describes the descent of man (but not woman!) from apes.

'''{{small|VII}}.''' {{Note label|G|VII|none}} Darwin's belief that black people had the same essential humanity as Europeans, and had many mental similarities, was reinforced by the lessons he had from [[John Edmonstone]] in 1826.&lt;ref name=eddy /&gt; Early in the ''Beagle'' voyage, Darwin nearly lost his position on the ship when he criticised FitzRoy's defence and praise of slavery. {{Harv|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=76 74]}} He wrote home about "how steadily the general feeling, as shown at elections, has been rising against Slavery. What a proud thing for England if she is the first European nation which utterly abolishes it! I was told before leaving England that after living in slave countries all my opinions would be altered; the only alteration I am aware of is forming a much higher estimate of the negro character." {{harv|Darwin|1887|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1452.1&amp;pageseq=264 246]}} Regarding [[Fuegians]], he "could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilized man: it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal, inasmuch as in man there is a greater power of improvement", but he knew and liked civilised Fuegians like [[Jemmy Button]]: "It seems yet wonderful to me, when I think over all his many good qualities, that he should have been of the same race, and doubtless partaken of the same character, with the miserable, degraded savages whom we first met here."{{Harv|Darwin|1845|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F14&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=218 205, 207–208]}}

In the ''Descent of Man'', he mentioned the similarity of Fuegians' and Edmonstone's minds to Europeans' when arguing against "ranking the so-called races of man as distinct species".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F937.1&amp;pageseq=227 214], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=245 232]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He rejected the ill-treatment of native people, and for example wrote of massacres of [[Patagonia]]n men, women, and children, "Every one here is fully convinced that this is the most just war, because it is against barbarians. Who would believe in this age that such atrocities could be committed in a Christian civilized country?"{{harv|Darwin|1845|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F14&amp;pageseq=115 102]}}

'''{{small|VIII}}.''' {{Note label|H|VIII|1}}{{Note label|H|VIII|2}} [[Genetics|Geneticists]] studied human heredity as [[Mendelian inheritance]], while [[eugenics]] movements sought to manage society, with a focus on social class in the United Kingdom, and on disability and ethnicity in the United States, leading to geneticists seeing this as impractical [[pseudoscience]]. A shift from voluntary arrangements to "negative" eugenics included [[compulsory sterilisation]] laws in the United States, copied by [[Nazi Germany]] as the basis for [[Nazi eugenics]] based on virulent racism and "[[racial hygiene]]".&lt;br /&gt;({{Cite news | url =http://www.stanford.edu/group/SHR/5-supp/text/thurtle.html| title =the creation of genetic identity| last = Thurtle| first =Phillip| date =17 December 1996| issue =Supplement: Cultural and Technological Incubations of Fascism| volume = 5| ref = harv| periodical =SEHR| accessdate =11 November 2008}}{{Cite news| url =http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/154/4/1419#The_Eclipse_of_Darwinism| title =The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection

'''CRISPR-Display ('''CRISP-Disp''')''' is a modification of the [[CRISPR|CRISPR/Cas9]] (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) system for genome editing. The CRISPR/Cas9 system uses a short guide RNA (sgRNA) sequence to direct a ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' [[Cas9]] nuclease, acting as a programmable DNA binding protein, to cleave DNA at a site of interest.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jinek|first=Martin|last2=Chylinski|first2=Krzysztof|last3=Fonfara|first3=Ines|last4=Hauer|first4=Michael|last5=Doudna|first5=Jennifer A.|last6=Charpentier|first6=Emmanuelle|date=2012-08-17|title=A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity|journal=Science|volume=337|issue=6096|pages=816–821|doi=10.1126/science.1225829|issn=1095-9203|pmid=22745249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cong|first=Le|last2=Ran|first2=F.

CRISPR-Display, in contrast, uses a nuclease deficient Cas9 (dCas9) and an engineered sgRNA with aptameric accessory RNA domains, ranging from 100bp to 5kb, outside of the normal complimentary targeting sequence.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shechner|first=David M.|last2=Hacisuleyman|first2=Ezgi|last3=Younger|first3=Scott T.|last4=Rinn|first4=John L.|date=2015-07-01|title=Multiplexable, locus-specific targeting of long RNAs with CRISPR-Display|journal=Nature Methods|volume=12|issue=7|pages=664–670|doi=10.1038/nmeth.3433|issn=1548-7105|pmc=4821475|pmid=26030444}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accessory RNA domains can be functional domains, such as long non-coding RNAs ([[Long non-coding RNA|lncRNAs]]), protein-binding motifs, or epitope tags for immunochemistry. This allows for investigation of the functionality of certain lncRNAs, and targeting of [[ribonucleoprotein]] (RNP) complexes to genomic loci.

CRISPR-Display was first published in Nature Methods in July 2015, and developed by David M. Shechner, Ezgi Hacisuleyman, Scott T. Younger and John Rinn at [[Harvard University]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), USA.

== Background ==
The CRISPR/Cas9 system is based on an adaptive immune system of prokaryotic organisms, and its use for genome editing was first proposed and developed in collaboration between [[Jennifer Doudna]] ([[University of California, Berkeley]]) and [[Emmanuelle Charpentier]] ([[Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology]], Germany).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The method, and its application in editing human cells, was published in Science on August 17, 2012. In January 2013, the [[Feng Zhang]] lab at the [[Broad Institute]] at MIT published another method in Science, having further optimized the sgRNA structure and expression for use in mammalian cells.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By the beginning of 2014, almost 2500 studies mentioning CRISPR in their title has been published.

[[Non-coding RNA]]s (ncRNAs) are RNA transcripts that are not translated into a protein product, but instead exert their function as RNA molecules. They are involved in a range of processes, like [[post-transcriptional regulation]] of gene expression, [[genomic imprinting]], and regulating the chromatin state, and thereby the expression, of a given locus. Many ncRNAs have been discovered, but in many cases, their function has yet to be accurately dissected due to technical challenges. ncRNA function is often not affected by introducing point mutations and premature stop codons. ncRNAs are also thought to regulate gene expression, so deletion studies have a hard time distinguishing effects of ncRNA loss from effects of gene misregulation due to the deletion. Studies of ncRNAs have also lacked the throughput necessary for discerning the RNA based functionality. To meet these challenges, the Rinn lab therefore developed a synthetic biology approach, using CRISPR/Cas9 system, with the Cas9 acting as a conduit, to target ncRNA modules to ectopic genomic locations, and investigating the ncRNAs effects on reporter genes and other genomic features at that site.

== Method development ==
CRISPR-Disp modifies the CRISPR/Cas9 technology by using a catalytically inactive, i.e. nuclease deficient, Cas9 mutant (dCas9), and altering the RNA used for targeting Cas9 to a genomic location.

Since sgRNAs are usually expressed by [[RNA polymerase III]], which limits the length of the RNA domain that can be inserted, CRISPR-Display incorporates [[RNA polymerase II]] to permit expression of longer transcripts (~80-250 nucleotides) to overcome this limitation. CRISPR-Display can therefore add larger RNA domains, like natural and lncRNA domains, without affecting dCas9 localization.

The sgRNA is engineered with an aptameric accessory RNA domain in the sequence outside of the targeting sequence. In the development of the technique, five model cofactors with different topology constructs were used: TOP1-4 and INT with an accessory domain (P4-P6 domain) at different positions, including the 5’ and 3’ end and internally within the sgRNA. Each domain contained a stem-loop that can be recognized by a PP7 bacteriophage coat protein. The complex was delivered into mammalian cells (HEK293FT cells) by a [[Viral vector|lentiviral vector]].
[[File:Transcription activator assay.png|thumb|448x448px|'''Transcription activator assay''' used to verify sgRNA/Cas9 complex targeting activity, and the proper integrity of the added RNA module. Direct activation: The transcription activator, VP64, is fused to the Cas9 protein, so proper targeting of the complex results in reporter gene activation. Bridged activation: VP64 is fused to PP7, which recognizes and binds a sequence in the RNA module when the RNA module is properly folded.]]
To ensure that the attached RNA module both retains targeting functionality as well as the resulting complex drive transcriptional activation at a specific site of interest, transient reporter gene expression of [[luciferase]] and fluorescent protein was measured. Two variations of such a '''transcription activator assay''' was performed; directly with a dCas9 fused to a transcriptional activator/repressor (VP64, a factor known to enhance gene expression) '''(Direct activation)''' or indirectly where the transcriptional activator is fused to an RNA binding protein module on the sgRNA '''(Bridged activation)'''. Reporter gene activation through direct activation imply the sgRNA variant binds and targets dCas9 efficiently. All the five topologies showed direct activation except TOP3 and TOP4, which showed reduced activity. Bridged activation indicates that the fused RNA accessory domain is intact in mature dCas9 complexes. Bridged activation was observed with TOP1, TOP3 and INT. The results were recapitulated at endogenous loci by targeting minimal sgRNA and selective expanded topologies (TOP1 and INT) to human ASCL1, IL1RN, NTF3 and TTN promoters. Direct and bridged activation were observed by qRT-PCR for each construct proving that CRISP-Disp allows deployment of large RNA domains to genomic loci.

The effect of internal (stem-loop) insertion size on dCas9 complex was assessed using INT-like constructs with cassettes of PP7 stem loops with a size range from 25 nt to 247 nt. Each construct induced significant activation in the reporter assays signifying that internal insertion size does not influence the dCas9 complex function. Similarly, the effect of internal insert sequence was also determined through a set of unique sgRNA variants displaying cassettes of 25 random nucleotides. Reporter assays and RIP-Seq confirmed that sequence does not govern complex efficacy.

The utility of CRISP-Disp was explored with an array of functional RNA domains such as natural protein binding motifs, artificial aptamers and small molecules with varying size. While all the complexes were functional and viable, and successfully deployed the RNA domains at endogenous loci, the efficacy changed with length and expression levels. This suggests that optimization of structure and sequence might be important required before designing the construct.

To determine if artificial lncRNA scaffolds can be used with CRISPR-Display, dCas9 complexes were assembled with artificial RNA with a size comparable to lncRNAs. The constructs were expanded to ~650nt size with an additional P4-P6 domain with hairpin loops that can be recognized by another phage coat protein, MS2. These topology constructs were called double TOP0-2 with the two domains either together at 5’ or 3’end or separately at each end. Transient reporter assays followed by confirmation with [[Immunoprecipitation|RNA Immunoprecipitation]] sequencing (RIP-qPCR) showed that all the three constructs retained both the domains in the complex.

This was also tested with natural lncRNA domains by building Pol II-driven TOP1 and INT constructs fused with human lncRNA domains. lncRNAs used had lengths between ~90-4800 nt, and included the NoRC-binding pRNA, three enhancer-transcribed RNAs (eRNAs) FALEC, TRERNA1 and ncRNA-a3), ''Xist'' A-repeat (RepA), and the 4,799-nt transcriptional activator ''[[HOTTIP]]''. While all the constructs showed significant direct activation, it decreased with increasing lncRNA-sgRNA length. These lncRNA domains could regulate the reporters independent of dCas9 with pRNA and RepA repressing the GLuc reporter expression (repressors) and TRERNA1, ncRNA-a3 and HOTTIP inducing activation (activators), but were properly targeted to an ectopic location of interest by using the CRISP-Disp system.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Thus, CRISP-Disp enables control of gene expression with deployment of both artificial scaffolds as well as natural lncRNA domains.

== Applications ==
CRISPR-Display allows for previously unavailable studies of lncRNA functionality, artificial ncRNA functionalization, recruitment of endogenous and engineered proteins to genomic loci, and locus affinity tagging for cell imaging. 
[[File:CRISPR-Display_applications.png|thumb|629x629px|CRISPR-Display allows addition of RNA modules to the sgRNA for a range of functionalities, such as ectopic lncRNA localization, recruitment of endogenous or engineered RNA binding proteins for gene regulation, or affinity tagging for live cell imaging. The functions can be performed simultaneous in the same cell.]]

=== lncRNA domain localization ===
CRISPR-Display allows targeted localization of natural lncRNAs to ectopic sites for investigation of their function. Exposing various ectopic DNA loci to natural lncRNAs can help show the effects of lncRNAs on gene expression and chromatin state, and help dissect the mechanism of such effects. One of the major outstanding questions in the study of lncRNAs is whether effects on chromatin state or gene expression adjacent to a lncRNA locus is due to functional, sequence-specific mechanisms of the lncRNA itself, or due simply to the act of transcribing the lncRNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perez-Pinera|first=Pablo|last2=Jones|first2=Matthew F.|last3=Lal|first3=Ashish|last4=Lu|first4=Timothy K.|date=2015-07-16|title=Putting Non-coding RNA on Display with CRISPR|journal=Molecular Cell|volume=59|issue=2|pages=146–148|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2015.07.002|issn=1097-4164|pmid=26186289}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melé|first=Marta|last2=Rinn|first2=John L.|date=2016-06-02|title="Cat's Cradling" the 3D Genome by the Act of LncRNA Transcription|journal=Molecular Cell|volume=62|issue=5|pages=657–664|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2016.05.011|issn=1097-4164|pmid=27259198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Localizing lncRNA to ectopic sites with CRISPR-Display can help separate the function of the RNA itself from the effects of transcribing such RNA species. Before CRISPR-Display, such studies were challenging due to low throughput, and inability to distinguish lncRNA function from other confounding factors like cryptically encoded peptides or functional DNA elements.

=== Artificial ncRNA functionalization ===
CRISPR-Display also allows for targeted use of the wide array of artificial RNAs with specific functionality, such as RNAs for recruitment of endogenous RNA-binding proteins, antibody affinity tagging, and recruitment of tagged fusion proteins.

==== Affinity tagging for live cell imaging ====

One example of artificial ncRNA functionalization is incorporating RNA domains recognized by specific antibodies to the sgRNA. CRISPR-Display can target the sgRNA with a particular epitope sequence to various loci, and fluorescently tagged antibodies can be used to image the locus, showing its localization in the nucleus, and possible interactions with other tagged proteins or genomic loci.

==== Recruitment of endogenous or engineered RNA binding proteins for gene regulation ====
Endogenous proteins known to bind a specific RNA motif can be recruited to ectopic genomic locations by incorporating the RNA motif into the sgRNA. CRISPR-Display can also recruit fusion proteins engineered to bind specific RNA sequences. Recruiting these proteins can allow studies of specific proteins’ and protein complexes’ effects on gene regulation and chromatin states, as well as specific regulation of certain genes for investigation of gene function.

=== Multiplexed functional studies ===
Due to the modularity of the sgRNA, several different sgRNAs with distinct functional modules can be expressed in each cell at once. The different RNA modules can then work simultaneously and independently, allowing for, for example, regulation of one genomic location whilst imaging the effects of the regulation at another location.

The possible applications of CRISPR-Display will continue to increase with further development and understanding of ncRNA functionalization. It is not unreasonable to think that CRISPR-Display may one day enable complex synthetic biology systems, with distinct temporal expression of sgRNAs, and networks and circuits of gene regulation by targeting of regulatory proteins.

== Advantages ==
* Can easily accommodate large RNA cargo (up to ~4.8kb, possibly even larger) within the sgRNA core. Therefore, structured RNA domains, natural long lncRNAs, artificial RNA modules and pools of random sequences can be used with dCas9.
* sgRNA-dCas9 complexation is not limited by sequence composition of the RNA cargo, but seems independent of the RNA modules used.
* CRISPR-Display is a modular method, which allows different functions to be simultaneously performed at diverse loci in the same cell. Using a single construct with orthogonal RNA binding proteins where each protein is fused to a unique functional domain and targeted by sgRNA containing its related RNA motif. (multiplexing) (already included in the applications)
* RNA modules can be added at different locations within the sgRNA sequence (internally, or at the 5’ or 3’ ends), so the location of the RNA module can be optimized or best function.
* Allows construction of Cas9 complexes with protein binding cassettes, artificial aptamers, pools of random sequences as well as natural lncRNAs.

== Limitations ==
* CRISPR-Display is currently limited by the number of available functional RNA motifs and RNA binding protein functions. As more such motifs and proteins are discovered and developed, further applications of CRISPR-Display may become possible.
* dCas9 complexation decreases with increasing sgRNA-lncRNA length. The quantitative yields of intact lncRNA domains are, however, recovered relative to the respective sgRNA. Therefore, construct integrity can depend on factors like length and RNA structure.
* Design of a high efficiency CRISPR-Display construct may require some structural or sequence optimization, which can lead to variable construct efficacy.

A '''deformity''', '''dysmorphism''', or '''dysmorphic feature''' is a major abnormality in the shape of a body part or organ compared to the normal shape of that part.
==Causes==
Deformity may arise from numerous causes:
*Genetic [[mutation]]
*Damage to the [[fetus]] or [[uterus]]
*Complications at [[childbirth|birth]]
*A growth or hormone disorder
*Reconstructive surgery following a severe injury, e.g. [[Third degree burn|burn injury]]
*[[Arthritis]] and other rheumatoid disorders
*Fractured bones left to heal without being properly [[Reduction (orthopedic_surgery)|set]] ([[malunion]])
*Chronic application of external forces, e.g. [[artificial cranial deformation]]
*Chronic [[paresis]], [[paralysis]] or [[muscle imbalance]], especially in children, e.g. due to [[poliomyelitis]] or [[cerebral palsy]]

Deformity can occur in non-humans, as well.  [[Frogs]] can be mutated due to [[Ribeiroia]] ([[Trematoda]]) infection.

==Mortality==
In many cases in which a major deformity is present at birth, it is the result of an underlying condition severe enough that the baby does not survive very long. The mortality of severely deformed births may be due to a range of complications including missing or non-functioning vital organs, structural defects that prevent breathing or eating, and high susceptibility to injuries, abnormal facial appearance, or infections that lead to death.

==In mythology==
[[Mythological]] creatures may have been created due to a deformative syndrome also, for instance, descriptions of [[mermaid]]s may be related to the symptoms of [[sirenomelia]]. The [[Irish Mythology]] includes the [[Fomorians]], who are almost without exception described as being deformed, possessing only one of what most have two of ([[human eye|eye]]s, [[arm]]s, [[Human leg|leg]]s, etc.) or having larger than normal limbs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34273">'''Third-generation sequencing''' (also known as '''long-read sequencing''') is a class of [[DNA sequencing]] methods currently under active development.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Third generation sequencing works by reading the nucleotide sequences at the single molecule level, in contrast to existing methods that require breaking long strands of DNA into small segments then inferring nucleotide sequences by amplification and synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.illumina.com/documents/products/techspotlights/techspotlight_sequencing.pdf|title=Illumina sequencing technology|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical challenges exist in the engineering of the necessary molecular instruments for whole genome sequencing to make the technology commercially available.

[[Massive parallel sequencing|Second-generation sequencing]], often referred to as Next-generation sequencing (NGS), has dominated the DNA sequencing space since its development. It has dramatically reduced the cost of DNA sequencing by enabling a massively-paralleled approach capable of producing large numbers of reads at exceptionally high coverages throughout the genome.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Treangen|first=Todd J.|last2=Salzberg|first2=Steven L.|date=2012-01-01|title=Repetitive DNA and next-generation sequencing: computational challenges and solutions|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=36–46|doi=10.1038/nrg3117|issn=1471-0056|pmc=3324860|pmid=22124482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since eukaryotic genomes contain many repetitive regions, a major limitation to this class of sequencing methods is the length of reads it produces.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Briefly, second generation sequencing works by first amplifying the DNA molecule and then conducting sequencing by synthesis. The collective fluorescent signal resulting from synthesizing a large number of amplified identical DNA strands allows the inference of nucleotide identity. However, due to random errors, DNA synthesis between the amplified DNA strands would become progressively out-of-sync. Quickly, the signal quality deteriorates as the read-length grows. In order to preserve read quality, long DNA molecules must be broken up into small segments, resulting in a critical limitation of second generation sequencing technologies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Computational efforts aimed to overcome this challenge often rely on approximative [[heuristic]]s that may not result in accurate assemblies.

By enabling direct sequencing of single DNA molecules, third generation sequencing technologies have the capability to produce substantially longer reads than second generation sequencing.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bleidorn|first=Christoph|date=2016-01-02|title=Third generation sequencing: technology and its potential impact on evolutionary biodiversity research|journal=Systematics and Biodiversity|volume=14|issue=1|pages=1–8|doi=10.1080/14772000.2015.1099575|issn=1477-2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such advantage has critical implications for both genome science and the study of biology in general. However, due to various technical challenges, third generation sequencing has error rates at almost unrepairable levels, rendering the technologies impractical for certain applications such as de novo genome assembly.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Pushpendra K.|date=2008-11-01|title=Single-molecule DNA sequencing technologies for future genomics research|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167779908002047|journal=Trends in Biotechnology|volume=26|issue=11|pages=602–611|doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2008.07.003|pmid=18722683}}&lt;/ref&gt; These technologies are undergoing active development and therefore it is expected that there will be further improvements to the high error rates. For applications that are more tolerant to error rates such as metagenomics or larger structural variant calling, third generation sequencing has been found to outperform existing methods.

== Current technologies ==
Sequencing technologies with a different approach than second-generation platforms were first described as "third-generation" in 2008-2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Check Hayden|first=Erika|date=2009-02-06|title=Genome sequencing: the third generation|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090206/full/news.2009.86.html|journal=Nature News|volume=457|issue=7231|pages=768–769|language=en|doi=10.1038/news.2009.86|pmid=19212365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several companies currently at the heart of third generation sequencing technology development, namely, [[Pacific Biosciences]], [[Oxford Nanopore Technologies|Oxford Nanopore Technology]], Quantapore (CA-USA), and Stratos (WA-USA). These companies are taking fundamentally different approaches to sequencing single DNA molecules.

PacBio developed the sequencing platform of [[SMRT sequencing|single molecule real time sequencing (SMRT)]], based on the properties of [[zero-mode waveguide]]s. Signals are in the form of fluorescent light emission from each nucleotide incorporated by a DNA polymerase bound to the bottom of the zL well.

[[Nanopore sequencing|Oxford Nanopore’s technology]] involves passing a DNA molecule through a nanoscale pore structure and then measuring changes in electrical field surrounding the pore; while Quantapore has a different proprietary nanopore approach. Stratos Genomics spaces out the DNA bases with polymeric inserts, "''Xpandomers''", to circumvent the signal to noise challenge of nanopore ssDNA reading.

Also notable is [[Helicos_single_molecule_fluorescent_sequencing|Helicos]]'s single molecule fluorescence approach, but the company entered bankruptcy in the [[Helicos_Biosciences|fall of 2015]].

== Advantages ==

=== Longer reads ===
In comparison to the current generation of sequencing technologies, third generation sequencing has the obvious advantage of producing much longer reads. It is expected that these longer read lengths will alleviate numerous computational challenges surrounding genome assembly, transcript reconstruction, and metagenomics among other important areas of modern biology and medicine.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

It is well known that eukaryotic genomes including primates and humans are complex and have large numbers of long repeated regions. Short reads from second generation sequencing must resort to approximative strategies in order to infer sequences over long ranges for assembly and genetic variant calling. [[Paired-end tag|Pair end reads]] have been leveraged by second generation sequencing to combat these limitations. However, exact fragment lengths of pair ends are often unknown and must also be approximated as well. By making long reads lengths possible, third generation sequencing technologies have clear advantages.

=== Epigenetics ===
[[Epigenetics|Epigenetic markers]] are stable and potentially heritable modifications to the DNA molecule that are not in its sequence. An example is DNA methylation at CpG sites, which has been found to influence gene expression. Histone modifications are another example. The current generation of sequencing technologies rely on laboratory techniques such as [[ChIP-sequencing]] for the detection of epigenetic markers. These techniques involve tagging the DNA strand, breaking and filtering fragments that contain markers, followed by sequencing. Third generation sequencing may enable direct detection of these markers due to their distinctive signal from the other four nucleotide bases.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Portability and speed ===
Other important advantages of third generation sequencing technologies include portability and sequencing speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schadt|first=E. E.|last2=Turner|first2=S.|last3=Kasarskis|first3=A.|date=2010-10-15|title=A window into third-generation sequencing|journal=Human Molecular Genetics|language=en|volume=19|issue=R2|pages=R227–R240|doi=10.1093/hmg/ddq416|issn=0964-6906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since minimal sample preprocessing is required in comparison to second generation sequencing, smaller equipments could be designed. Oxford Nanopore Technology has recently commercialized the [https://nanoporetech.com/products/minion MinION sequencer]. This sequencing machine is roughly the size of a regular USB flash drive and can be used readily by connecting to a laptop. In addition, since the sequencing process is not parallelized across regions of the genome, data could be collected and analyzed in real time. These advantages of third generation sequencing may be well-suited in hospital settings where quick and on-site data collection and analysis is demanded.

== Challenges ==

Third generation sequencing, as it currently stands, faces important challenges mainly surrounding accurate identification of nucleotide bases; error rates are still much higher compared to second generation sequencing.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This is generally due to instability of the molecular machinery involved. For example, in PacBio’s single molecular and real time sequencing technology, the DNA polymerase molecule becomes increasingly damaged as the sequencing process occurs.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Additionally, since the process happens quickly, the signals given off by individual bases may be blurred by signals from neighbouring bases. This poses a new computational challenge for deciphering the signals and consequently inferring the sequence. Methods such as [[Hidden Markov model|Hidden Markov Models]], for example, have been leveraged for this purpose with some success.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On average, different individuals of the human population share about 99.9% of their genes. In other words, approximately only one out of every thousand bases would differ between any two person. The high error rates involved with third generation sequencing are inevitably problematic for the purpose of characterizing individual differences that exist between members of the same species.

== Genome assembly ==
[[Sequence assembly|Genome assembly]] is the reconstruction of whole genome DNA sequences. This is generally done with two fundamentally different approaches.

=== Reference alignment ===
When a reference genome is available, as one is in the case of human, newly sequenced reads could simply be aligned to the reference genome in order to characterize its properties. Such reference based assembly is quick and easy but has the disadvantage of “hiding" novel sequences and large copy number variants. In addition, reference genomes do not yet exist for most organisms.

=== ''De novo'' assembly ===
''De novo'' assembly is the alternative genome assembly approach to reference alignment. It refers to the reconstruction of whole genome sequences entirely from raw sequence reads. This method would be chosen when there is no reference genome, when the species of the given organism is unknown as in [[metagenomics]], or when there exist genetic variants of interest that may not be detected by reference genome alignment.

Given the short reads produced by the current generation of sequencing technologies, de novo assembly is a major computational problem. It is normally approached by an iterative process of finding and connecting sequence reads with sensible overlaps. Various computational and statistical techniques, such as [[De Bruijn graph|de bruijn graphs]] and overlap layout consensus graphs, have been leveraged to solve this problem. Nonetheless, due to the highly repetitive nature of eukaryotic genomes, accurate and complete reconstruction of genome sequences in de novo assembly remains challenging. [[Paired-end tag|Pair end reads]] have been posed as a possible solution, though exact fragment lengths are often unknown and must be approximated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Ruiqiang|last2=Zhu|first2=Hongmei|last3=Ruan|first3=Jue|last4=Qian|first4=Wubin|last5=Fang|first5=Xiaodong|last6=Shi|first6=Zhongbin|last7=Li|first7=Yingrui|last8=Li|first8=Shengting|last9=Shan|first9=Gao|date=2010-02-01|title=De novo assembly of human genomes with massively parallel short read sequencing|url=http://genome.cshlp.org/content/20/2/265|journal=Genome Research|language=en|volume=20|issue=2|pages=265–272|doi=10.1101/gr.097261.109|issn=1088-9051|pmc=2813482|pmid=20019144}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:HybridAssembly.png|thumb|480x480px|Hybrid assembly - the use of reads from 3rd gen sequencing platforms with shorts reads from 2nd gen platforms - may be used to resolve ambiguities that exist in genomes previously assembled using second generation sequencing. Short second generation reads have also been used to correct errors that exist in the long third generation reads.]]

=== Hybrid assembly ===
Long read lengths offered by third generation sequencing may alleviate many of the challenges currently faced by de novo genome assemblies. For example, if an entire repetitive region can be sequenced unambiguously in a single read, no computation inference would be required. Computational methods have been proposed to alleviate the issue of high error rates. For example, in one study, it was demonstrated that de novo assembly of a microbial genome using PacBio sequencing alone performed superior to that of second generation sequencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chin|first=Chen-Shan|last2=Alexander|first2=David H.|last3=Marks|first3=Patrick|last4=Klammer|first4=Aaron A.|last5=Drake|first5=James|last6=Heiner|first6=Cheryl|last7=Clum|first7=Alicia|last8=Copeland|first8=Alex|last9=Huddleston|first9=John|date=2013-06-01|title=Nonhybrid, finished microbial genome assemblies from long-read SMRT sequencing data|journal=Nature Methods|language=en|volume=10|issue=6|pages=563–569|doi=10.1038/nmeth.2474|pmid=23644548|issn=1548-7091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third generation sequencing may also be used in conjunction with second generation sequencing. This approach is often referred to as hybrid sequencing. For example, long reads from third generation sequencing may be used to resolve ambiguities that exist in genomes previously assembled using second generation sequencing. On the other hand, short second generation reads have been used to correct errors in that exist in the long third generation reads. In general, this hybrid approach has been shown to improve de novo genome assemblies significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodwin|first=Sara|last2=Gurtowski|first2=James|last3=Ethe-Sayers|first3=Scott|last4=Deshpande|first4=Panchajanya|last5=Schatz|first5=Michael C.|last6=McCombie|first6=W.

== Epigenetic markers ==
[[DNA methylation|DNA methylation (DNAm)]] – the covalent modification of [[DNA]] at CpG sites resulting in attached [[methyl group]]s – is the best understood component of [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] machinery. DNA modifications and resulting gene expression can vary across cell types, temporal development, with genetic ancestry, can change due to environmental stimuli and are heritable. After the discovery of DNAm, researchers have also found its correlation to diseases like cancer and [[autism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fraser|first=Hunter B.|last2=Lam|first2=Lucia L.|last3=Neumann|first3=Sarah M.|last4=Kobor|first4=Michael S.|date=2012-02-09|title=Population-specificity of human DNA methylation|journal=Genome Biology|volume=13|issue=2|pages=R8|doi=10.1186/gb-2012-13-2-r8|issn=1474-760X|pmc=3334571|pmid=22322129}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this disease etiology context DNAm is an important avenue of further research.

=== Advantages ===
The current most common methods for examining methylation state [[DNA methylation#Detection|require an assay]] that fragments DNA before standard second generation sequencing on the [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] platform. As a result of short read length, information regarding the longer patterns of methylation are lost.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite biorxiv|last=Simpson|first=Jared T.|last2=Workman|first2=Rachael|last3=Zuzarte|first3=Philip C.|last4=David|first4=Matei|last5=Dursi|first5=Lewis Jonathan|last6=Timp|first6=Winston|date=2016-04-04|title=Detecting DNA Methylation using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION sequencer|biorxiv=047142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third generation sequencing technologies offer the capability for single molecule real-time sequencing of longer reads, and detection of DNA modification without the aforementioned assay.&lt;ref name="Flusberg 461–465"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flusberg|first=Benjamin A.|last2=Webster|first2=Dale R.|last3=Lee|first3=Jessica H.|last4=Travers|first4=Kevin J.|last5=Olivares|first5=Eric C.|last6=Clark|first6=Tyson A.|last7=Korlach|first7=Jonas|last8=Turner|first8=Stephen W.|date=2010-06-01|title=Direct detection of DNA methylation during single-molecule, real-time sequencing|journal=Nature Methods|language=en|volume=7|issue=6|pages=461–465|doi=10.1038/nmeth.1459|pmc=2879396|pmid=20453866}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:3rd_gen_Epigenetics.png|thumb|577x577px|PacBio SMRT technology and Oxford Nanopore can use unaltered DNA to detect methylation.]]
[[Oxford Nanopore Technologies|Oxford Nanopore Technologies’]] [[MinION]] has been used to detect DNAm. As each DNA strand passes through a pore, it produces electrical signals which have been found to be sensitive to epigenetic changes in the nucleotides, and a [[hidden Markov model]] (HMM) was used to analyze MinION data to detect [[5-Methylcytosine|5-methylcytosine]] (5mC) DNA modification.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The model was trained using synthetically methylated [[Escherichia coli|''E. coli'']] DNA and the resulting signals measured by the nanopore technology. Then the trained model was used to detect 5mC in MinION genomic reads from a human cell line which already had a reference methylome. The classifier has 82% accuracy in randomly sampled singleton sites, which increases to 95% when more stringent thresholds are applied.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Other methods address different types of DNA modifications using the MinION platform. Stoiber et al. examined 4-methylcytosine (4mC) and 6-methyladenine (6mA), along with 5mC, and also created a software to directly visualize the raw MinION data in human-friendly way.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite biorxiv|last=Stoiber|first=Marcus H.|last2=Quick|first2=Joshua|last3=Egan|first3=Rob|last4=Lee|first4=Ji Eun|last5=Celniker|first5=Susan E.|last6=Neely|first6=Robert|last7=Loman|first7=Nicholas|last8=Pennacchio|first8=Len|last9=Brown|first9=James B.|date=2016-12-15|title=De novo Identification of DNA Modifications Enabled by Genome-Guided Nanopore Signal Processing|biorxiv=094672}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here they found that in ''E. coli'', which has a known [[methylome]], event windows of 5 base pairs long can be used to divide and statistically analyze the raw MinION electrical signals. A straightforward [[Mann–Whitney U test|Mann-Whitney U test]] can detect modified portions of the ''E. coli'' sequence, as well as further split the modifications into 4mC, 6mA or 5mC regions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It seems likely that in the future, MinION raw data will be used to detect many different epigenetic marks in DNA.

[[Pacific Biosciences|PacBio]] sequencing has also been used to detect DNA methylation. In this platform the pulse width - the width of a fluorescent light pulse - corresponds to a specific base. In 2010 it was shown that the interpulse distance in control and methylated samples are different, and there is a "signature" pulse width for each methylation type.&lt;ref name="Flusberg 461–465"/&gt; In 2012 using the PacBio platform the binding sites of DNA [[methyltransferase]]s were characterized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark|first=T.

Other forms of DNA modifications – from heavy metals, oxidation, or UV damage – are also possible avenues of research using Oxford Nanopore and PacBio third generation sequencing.

=== Drawbacks ===
Processing of the raw data – such as normalization to the median signal – was needed on MinION raw data, reducing real-time capability of the technology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Consistency of the electrical signals is still an issue, making it difficult to accurately call a nucleotide. MinION has low throughput; since multiple overlapping reads are hard to obtain, this further leads to accuracy problems of downstream DNA modification detection. Both the hidden Markov model and statistical methods used with MinION raw data require repeated observations of DNA modifications for detection, meaning that individual modified nucleotides need to be consistently present in multiple copies of the genome, e.g. in multiple cells or plasmids in the sample.

For the PacBio platform, too, depending on what methylation you expect to find, coverage needs can vary. As of March 2017, other epigenetic factors like histone modifications have not been discoverable using third-generation technologies. Longer patterns of methylation are often lost because smaller contigs still need to be assembled.

== Transcriptomics ==
[[Transcriptomics]] is the study of the [[transcriptome]], usually by characterizing the relative abundances of messenger RNA molecules the tissue under study. According to the [[central dogma of molecular biology]], genetic information flows from double stranded DNA molecules to single stranded mRNA molecules where they can be readily translated into function protein molecules. By studying the transcriptome, one can gain valuable insight into the regulation of gene expressions.

While expression levels as the gene level can be more or less accurately depicted by second generation sequencing, transcript level information is still an important challenge.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steijger|first=Tamara|last2=Abril|first2=Josep F.|last3=Engström|first3=Pär G.|last4=Kokocinski|first4=Felix|last5=The RGASP Consortium|last6=Hubbard|first6=Tim J.|last7=Guigó|first7=Roderic|last8=Harrow|first8=Jennifer|last9=Bertone|first9=Paul|date=2013-12-01|title=Assessment of transcript reconstruction methods for RNA-seq|journal=Nature Methods|language=en|volume=10|issue=12|pages=1177–1184|doi=10.1038/nmeth.2714|issn=1548-7091|pmc=3851240|pmid=24185837}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, the role of alternative splicing in molecular biology remains largely elusive. Third generation sequencing technologies hold promising prospects in resolving this issue by enabling sequencing of mRNA molecules at their full lengths.

=== Alternative splicing ===
[[Alternative splicing]] (AS) is the process by which a single gene may give rise to multiple distinct mRNA transcripts and consequently different protein translations.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graveley|first=Brenton R.|title=Alternative splicing: increasing diversity in the proteomic world|journal=Trends in Genetics|volume=17|issue=2|pages=100–107|doi=10.1016/s0168-9525(00)02176-4|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some evidence suggests that AS is a ubiquitous phenomenon and may play a key role in determining the phenotypes of organisms, especially in complex eukaryotes; all eukaryotes contain genes consisting of introns that may undergo AS. In particular, it has been estimated that AS occurs in 95% of all human multi-exon genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pan|first=Qun|last2=Shai|first2=Ofer|last3=Lee|first3=Leo J.|last4=Frey|first4=Brendan J.|last5=Blencowe|first5=Benjamin J.|date=2008-12-01|title=Deep surveying of alternative splicing complexity in the human transcriptome by high-throughput sequencing|journal=Nature Genetics|language=en|volume=40|issue=12|pages=1413–1415|doi=10.1038/ng.259|pmid=18978789|issn=1061-4036}}&lt;/ref&gt; AS has undeniable potential to influence myriad biological processes. Advancing knowledge in this area has critical implications for the study of biology in general.

=== Transcript reconstruction ===
The current generation of sequencing technologies produce only short reads, putting tremendous limitation on the ability to detect distinct transcripts; short reads must be reverse engineered into original transcripts that could have given rise to the resulting read observations.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pertea|first=Mihaela|last2=Pertea|first2=Geo M.|last3=Antonescu|first3=Corina M.|last4=Chang|first4=Tsung-Cheng|last5=Mendell|first5=Joshua T.|last6=Salzberg|first6=Steven L.|date=2015-03-01|title=StringTie enables improved reconstruction of a transcriptome from RNA-seq reads|journal=Nature Biotechnology|language=en|volume=33|issue=3|pages=290–295|doi=10.1038/nbt.3122|issn=1087-0156|pmc=4643835|pmid=25690850}}&lt;/ref&gt; This task is further complicated by the highly variable expression levels across transcripts, and consequently variable read coverages across the sequence of the gene.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In addition, exons may be shared among individual transcripts, rendering unambiguous inferences essentially impossible.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Existing computational methods make inferences based on the accumulation of short reads at various sequence locations often by making simplifying assumptions.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; [https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/ Cufflinks] takes a parsimonious approach, seeking to explain all the reads with the fewest possible number of transcripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trapnell|first=Cole|last2=Williams|first2=Brian A.|last3=Pertea|first3=Geo|last4=Mortazavi|first4=Ali|last5=Kwan|first5=Gordon|last6=van Baren|first6=Marijke J.|last7=Salzberg|first7=Steven L.|last8=Wold|first8=Barbara J.|last9=Pachter|first9=Lior|date=2010-05-01|title=Transcript assembly and quantification by RNA-Seq reveals unannotated transcripts and isoform switching during cell differentiation|journal=Nature Biotechnology|language=en|volume=28|issue=5|pages=511–515|doi=10.1038/nbt.1621|issn=1087-0156|pmc=3146043|pmid=20436464}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, StringTie attempts to simultaneously estimate transcript abundances while assembling the reads.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; These methods, while reasonable, may not always identify real transcripts.

A study published in 2008 surveyed 25 different existing transcript reconstruction protocols.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Its evidence suggested that existing methods are generally weak in assembling transcripts, though the ability to detect individual exons are relatively intact.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; According to the estimates, average sensitivity to detect exons across the 25 protocols is 80% for Caenorhabditis elegans genes.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In comparison, transcript identification sensitivity decreases to 65%. For human, the study reported an exon detection sensitivity averaging to 69% and transcript detection sensitivity had an average of mere 33%.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In other words, for human, existing methods are able to identify less than half of all existing transcript.

Third generation sequencing technologies have demonstrated promising prospects in solving the problem of transcript detection as well as mRNA abundance estimation at the level of transcripts. While error rates remain high, third generation sequencing technologies have the capability to produce much longer read lengths.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abdel-Ghany|first=Salah E.|last2=Hamilton|first2=Michael|last3=Jacobi|first3=Jennifer L.|last4=Ngam|first4=Peter|last5=Devitt|first5=Nicholas|last6=Schilkey|first6=Faye|last7=Ben-Hur|first7=Asa|last8=Reddy|first8=Anireddy S.

== Metagenomics ==

[[Metagenomics]] is the analysis of genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples.

=== Advantages ===
The main advantage for third-generation sequencing technologies in [[metagenomics]] is their speed of sequencing in comparison to second generation techniques. Speed of sequencing is important for example in the clinical setting (i.e. [[pathogen]] identification), to allow for efficient diagnosis and timely clinical actions.

Oxford Nanopore's MinION was used in 2015 for real-time metagenomic detection of pathogens in complex, high-background clinical samples. The first [[Ebola virus]] (EBV) read was sequenced 44 seconds after data acquisition.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greninger|first=Alexander L.|last2=Naccache|first2=Samia N.|last3=Federman|first3=Scot|last4=Yu|first4=Guixia|last5=Mbala|first5=Placide|last6=Bres|first6=Vanessa|last7=Stryke|first7=Doug|last8=Bouquet|first8=Jerome|last9=Somasekar|first9=Sneha|date=2015-01-01|title=Rapid metagenomic identification of viral pathogens in clinical samples by real-time nanopore sequencing analysis|journal=Genome Medicine|volume=7|pages=99|doi=10.1186/s13073-015-0220-9|issn=1756-994X|pmc=4587849|pmid=26416663}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was uniform mapping of reads to genome; at least one read mapped to &gt;88% of the genome. The relatively long reads allowed for sequencing of a near-complete viral genome to high accuracy (97–99% identity) directly from a primary clinical sample.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A common [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] marker for microbial community diversity studies is the 16S [[ribosomal RNA]] gene. Both MinION and PacBio's SMRT platform have been used to sequence this gene.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schloss|first=Patrick D.|last2=Jenior|first2=Matthew L.|last3=Koumpouras|first3=Charles C.|last4=Westcott|first4=Sarah L.|last5=Highlander|first5=Sarah K.|date=2016-01-01|title=Sequencing 16S rRNA gene fragments using the PacBio SMRT DNA sequencing system|journal=PeerJ|volume=4|pages=e1869|doi=10.7717/peerj.1869|pmc=4824876|pmid=27069806}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benítez-Páez|first=Alfonso|last2=Portune|first2=Kevin J.|last3=Sanz|first3=Yolanda|date=2016-01-01|title=Species-level resolution of 16S rRNA gene amplicons sequenced through the MinION™ portable nanopore sequencer|journal=GigaScience|volume=5|pages=4|doi=10.1186/s13742-016-0111-z|issn=2047-217X|pmc=4730766|pmid=26823973}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context the PacBio error rate was comparable to that of shorter reads from [[454 Life Sciences|454]] and Illumina's MiSeq sequencing platforms.

=== Drawbacks ===
MinION's high error rate (~10-40%) prevented identification of [[antimicrobial resistance]] markers, for which single nucleotide resolution is necessary. For the same reason [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] pathogens were not identified.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ease of carryover contamination when re-using same the flow cell (standard wash protocols don’t work) is also a concern. Unique barcodes may allow for more multiplexing. Furthermore, performing accurate species identification for [[bacteria]], [[Fungus|fungi]] and [[Parasitism|parasites]] is very difficult, as they share a larger portion of the genome, and some only differ by &lt;5%.

The per base sequencing cost is still significantly more than that of MiSeq. However, the prospect of supplementing reference databases with full-length sequences from organisms below the limit of detection from the [[Sanger sequencing|Sanger]] approach;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; this could possibly greatly help the identification of organisms in metagenomics.

Before third generation sequencing can be used reliably in the clinical context, there is a need for standardization of lab protocols. These protocols are not yet as optimized as PCR methods.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9165">Trans-Golgi network vesicle protein 23 A ('''TVP23A''') is a [[protein]] coded for the TVP23A [[gene]], formally known as FAM18A.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/780776 |title=TVP23A}}&lt;/ref&gt; TVP23A is located on chromosome 16.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=TVP23A|website=GeneCards|title=GeneCards}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is known to have human paralogs, [[FAM18B1|TVP23B]] and TVP23C, as well as orthologs in many different species, notably yeast, mice, and chickens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ieb/research/acembly/av.cgi?db=human&amp;c=Gene&amp;l=FAM18A|website=AceView|title=AceView}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general consensus on the TVP23A protein indicate that it has some function in the late [[Golgi apparatus]] and is involved in retrograde transport from endosomes back into the Golgi apparatus. The nature of this transport is still unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genatlas.medecine.univ-paris5.fr/fiche.php?n=28506|website=GenAtlas|title=GenAtlas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gene ==

[[File:TVP23A Location.png|Location of TVP23A on Chromosome 16 (red line)|none|frame]]

===Alternative Names===
TVP23A stands for '''&lt;u&gt;T&lt;/u&gt;'''rans-Golgi network '''&lt;u&gt;V&lt;/u&gt;'''esicle '''&lt;u&gt;P&lt;/u&gt;'''rotein '''&lt;u&gt;23A&lt;/u&gt;''' TVP23A, is the current name for the protein.  Aliases of TVP23A include FAM18A, and rarely YDR084C.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== mRNA ==

=== Isoforms ===
There are two known [[isoform]]s of TVP23A, variant one and variant two, with variant one being the more common variant in humans.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Protein ==

=== Structure ===

TVP23A is a member of the pfam superfamily containing the [[domain of unknown function]] 846 (DUF846).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cddsrv.cgi?uid=191380 |title=DUF846}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TVP23A has a predicted molecular weight of 24.1 kilodaltons, an isoelectric point of 6.5, and relatively high amounts of [[tryptophan]] and [[phenylalanine]].&lt;ref name="Biology Workbench"&gt;{{cite web|title=SAPS|url=http://seqtool.sdsc.edu/CGI/BW.cgi#!|website=Biology Workbench|publisher=SDSC}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The secondary structure of TVP23A consists primarily of [[alpha helices]] composing 4 transmembrane domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TMHMM|url=http://seqtool.sdsc.edu/CGI/BW.cgi#!|website=Biology Workbench}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is not much information on the tertiary structure of TVP23A or its homologs.  iTASSER&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I-TASSER server for protein structure and function prediction|url=http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/|website=zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; was used to generate a prediction for the folding pattern of TVP23A, which supports the presence of multiple helix structures.
[[File:TVP23Astructure.jpg|none|thumb|Protein structure of TVP23A as predicted by iTASSER]]

== Expression ==
TVP23A is ubiquitously expressed in all human tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gene: TVP23A|url=http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/ExpressionAtlas?g=ENSG00000166676;r=16:10760919-10818794|website=www.ensembl.org|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence of higher expression in the brain tissue of mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GDS3142 / 1435130_at|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/tools/profileGraph.cgi?ID=GDS3142:1435130_at|website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promoter for TVP23A is GXP_91266, spanning 1403 base pairs located on the negative strand of chromosome 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ElDorado|url=https://www.genomatix.de/|website=Genomatix.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
The hypothesized function of TVP23A is a transmembrane protein involved in retrograde transport of [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicles]] from early [[endosome]]s into the late Golgi apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Inadome|first1=Hironori|last2=Noda|first2=Yoichi|last3=Kamimura|first3=Yurika|last4=Adachi|first4=Hiroyuki|last5=Yoda|first5=Koji|title=Tvp38, Tvp23, Tvp18 and Tvp15: Novel membrane proteins in the Tlg2-containing Golgi/endosome compartments of Saccharomyces cerevisiae|journal=Experimental Cell Research|date=February 2007|volume=313|issue=4|pages=688–697|doi=10.1016/j.yexcr.2006.11.008|pmid=17178117}}&lt;/ref&gt; TVP23A interactions with [[SNARE (protein)|SNARE]] TVI1 were found to be required for retrograde transport.

== Interacting Proteins ==
TVP23A has been found to interact with four different proteins via Yeast [[Two-hybrid screening|two hybrid arrays]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IntAct|url=http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/|website=www.ebi.ac.uk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two of these proteins, YIPF1 and YIPF2, are believed to be Golgi transport proteins.

== Homology ==

=== Homologous Domains ===
TVP23A is a DUF846 containing protein, which is homologous throughout TVP-type proteins.  This domain contains the 4 transmembrane domains of TVP23A&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pfam.xfam.org/family/PF05832|title=Pfam: Family: DUF846 (PF05832)|website=pfam.xfam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paralogs ===
TVP23A has two paralogs, [[FAM18B1|TVP23B]] and TVP23C.  TVP23B and TVP23C are 96% similar to each other, and both are located on [[Chromosome 17 (human)|chromosome 17]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BLAST: Basic Local Alignment Search Tool|url=https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi|website=blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the locations of these three genes, and their identities to each other, it is probable that ancestral TVP23 underwent [[Gene duplication|duplication]] and [[Translocation (genetics)|translocation]], giving rise to TVP23A on chromosome 16 and TVP23B/C on chromosome 17, which then underwent a second duplication to form TVP23B and TVP23C.

'''[[Machine learning]]''', a subfield of [[computer science]] involving the development of algorithms that learn how to make predictions based on data, has a number of emerging applications in the field of [[bioinformatics]]. Bioinformatics deals with computational and mathematical approaches for understanding and processing biological data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Prior to the emergence of machine learning algorithms, bioinformatics algorithms had to be explicitly programmed by hand which, for problems such as [[protein structure prediction]], proves extremely difficult.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Yuedong|last2=Gao|first2=Jianzhao|last3=Wang|first3=Jihua|last4=Heffernan|first4=Rhys|last5=Hanson|first5=Jack|last6=Paliwal|first6=Kuldip|last7=Zhou|first7=Yaoqi|title=Sixty-five years of the long march in protein secondary structure prediction: the final stretch?|journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics|volume=19|issue=3|pages=482–494|doi=10.1093/bib/bbw129|pmid=28040746|pmc=5952956|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machine learning techniques such as [[deep learning]] enable the algorithm to make use of automatic [[feature learning]] which means that based on the dataset alone, the algorithm can learn how to combine multiple [[Feature (machine learning)|features]] of the input data into a more abstract set of features from which to conduct further learning. This multi-layered approach to learning patterns in the input data allows such systems to make quite complex predictions when trained on large datasets. In recent years, the size and number of available biological datasets have skyrocketed, enabling bioinformatics researchers to make use of these machine learning systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Machine learning has been applied to six main subfields of bioinformatics: [[genomics]], [[proteomics]], [[microarrays]], [[systems biology]], [[evolution]], and [[text mining]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larrañaga|first=Pedro|last2=Calvo|first2=Borja|last3=Santana|first3=Roberto|last4=Bielza|first4=Concha|last5=Galdiano|first5=Josu|last6=Inza|first6=Iñaki|last7=Lozano|first7=José A.|last8=Armañanzas|first8=Rubén|last9=Santafé|first9=Guzmán|title=Machine learning in bioinformatics|journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics|volume=7|issue=1|pages=86–112|doi=10.1093/bib/bbk007|pmid=16761367|date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Genomics ===
[[File:Growth of GenBank.png|thumb|The exponential growth of GenBank, a genomic sequence database provided by the National center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)]]
[[Genomics]] involves the study of the [[genome]], the complete DNA sequence, of organisms. While genomic sequence data has historically been sparse due to the technical difficulty in sequencing a piece of DNA, the number of available sequences is growing exponentially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/statistics/|title=GenBank and WGS Statistics|website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while raw data is becoming increasingly available and accessible, the biological interpretation of this data is occurring at a much slower pace.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mathé|first=Catherine|last2=Sagot|first2=Marie-France|last3=Schiex|first3=Thomas|last4=Rouzé|first4=Pierre|date=October 1, 2002|title=Current methods of gene prediction, their strengths and weaknesses|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=30|issue=19|pages=4103–4117|issn=1362-4962|pmc=140543|pmid=12364589|doi=10.1093/nar/gkf543}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, there is an increasing need for the development of machine learning systems that can automatically determine the location of protein-encoding genes within a given DNA sequence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is a problem in computational biology known as [[gene prediction]].

Gene prediction is commonly performed through a combination of what are known as extrinsic and intrinsic searches.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For the extrinsic search, the input DNA sequence is run through a large database of sequences whose genes have been previously discovered and their locations annotated. A number of the sequence's genes can be identified by determining which strings of bases within the sequence are [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to known gene sequences. However, given the limitation in size of the database of known and annotated gene sequences, not all the genes in a given input sequence can be identified through homology alone. Therefore, an intrinsic search is needed where a gene prediction program attempts to identify the remaining genes from the DNA sequence alone.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Machine learning has also been used for the problem of [[multiple sequence alignment]] which involves aligning many DNA or amino acid sequences in order to determine regions of similarity that could indicate a shared evolutionary history.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
It can also be used to detect and visualize genome rearrangements.&lt;ref name="rearrang"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pratas|first=D|author2=Silva, R|author3= Pinho, A|author4= Ferreira, P|title=An alignment-free method to find and visualise rearrangements between pairs of DNA sequences.|journal=Scientific Reports (Group Nature)|date=May 18, 2015|volume=5|number=10203|pmid=25984837|doi=10.1038/srep10203|pages=10203|pmc=4434998|bibcode=2015NatSR...510203P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proteomics ===

[[Protein]]s, strings of [[amino acid]]s, gain much of their function from [[protein folding]] in which they conform into a three-dimensional structure. This structure is composed of a number of layers of folding, including the [[Protein primary structure|primary structure]] (i.e. the flat string of amino acids), the [[Protein secondary structure|secondary structure]] ([[Alpha helix|alpha helices]] and [[beta sheet]]s), the [[Protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]], and the [[Protein quaternary structure|quartenary structure]].

Protein secondary structure prediction is a main focus of this subfield as the further protein foldings (tertiary and quartenary structures) are determined based on the secondary structure.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Solving the true structure of a protein is an incredibly expensive and time-intensive process, furthering the need for systems that can accurately predict the structure of a protein by analyzing the amino acid sequence directly.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Prior to machine learning, researchers needed to conduct this prediction manually. This trend began in 1951 when Pauling and Corey released their work on predicting the hydrogen bond configurations of a protein from a polypeptide chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pauling|first=L.|last2=Corey|first2=R.

Machine learning has also been applied to proteomics problems such as [[Side chain|protein side-chain]] prediction, [[Turn (biochemistry)|protein loop]] modeling, and [[protein contact map]] prediction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Microarrays ===
Microarrays, a type of [[lab-on-a-chip]], are used for automatically collecting data about large amounts of biological material. Machine learning can aid in the analysis of this data, and it has been applied to expression pattern identification, classification, and genetic network induction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:DNA-microarray analysis.jpg|thumb|A DNA-microarray analysis of Burkitt's lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is shown and identifies differences in gene expression patterns.]]
This technology is especially useful for monitoring the expression of genes within a genome, aiding in diagnosing different types of cancer based on which genes are expressed.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pirooznia|first=Mehdi|last2=Yang|first2=Jack Y.|last3=Yang|first3=Mary Qu|last4=Deng|first4=Youping|date=2008|title=A comparative study of different machine learning methods on microarray gene expression data|journal=BMC Genomics|volume=9|issue=1|pages=S13|doi=10.1186/1471-2164-9-S1-S13|issn=1471-2164|pmc=2386055|pmid=18366602}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main problems in this field is identifying which genes are expressed based on the collected data.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, due to the huge number of genes on which data is collected by the microarray, there is a large amount of irrelevant data to the task of expressed gene identification, further complicating this problem. Machine learning presents a potential solution to this problem as various classification methods can be used to perform this identification. The most commonly used methods are [[radial basis function network]]s, [[deep learning]], [[Naive Bayes classifier|Bayesian classification]], [[decision tree]]s, and [[random forest]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Systems biology ===
Systems biology focuses on the study of the emergent behaviors from complex interactions of simple biological components in a system. Such components can include molecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/researchtopic/2362/machine-learning-in-molecular-systems-biology|title=Machine Learning in Molecular Systems Biology|website=Frontiers|language=en|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Machine learning has been used to aid in the modelling of these complex interactions in biological systems in domains such as genetic networks, signal transduction networks, and metabolic pathways.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Graphical model|Probabilistic graphical models]], a machine learning technique for determining the structure between different variables, are one of the most commonly used methods for modeling genetic networks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, machine learning has been applied to systems biology problems such as identifying [[DNA binding site|transcription factor binding sites]] using a technique known as [[Markov chain|Markov chain optimization]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Genetic algorithm]]s, machine learning techniques which are based on the natural process of evolution, have been used to model genetic networks and regulatory structures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Other systems biology applications of machine learning include the task of enzyme function prediction, high throughput microarray data analysis, analysis of genome-wide association studies to better understand markers of Multiple Sclerosis, protein function prediction, and identification of NCR-sensitivity of genes in yeast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=d'Alché-Buc|first=Florence|last2=Wehenkel|first2=Louis|date=2008|title=Machine Learning in Systems Biology|journal=BMC Proceedings|volume=2|issue=4|pages=S1|doi=10.1186/1753-6561-2-S4-S1|issn=1753-6561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Applications in stroke ===
Machine learning methods to analyze neuroimaging data help to stroke diagnosis. Three-dimensional CNN and SVM methods are often used. 
&lt;ref name="stroke1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jiang |first1=Fei |title=Artificial intelligence in healthcare: past, present and future |journal=BMJ Journals Stroke and Vascular Neurology |date=2017 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=230–243 |doi=10.1136/svn-2017-000101 |pmid=29507784 |pmc=5829945 |url=https://svn.bmj.com/content/svnbmj/2/4/230.full.pdf |accessdate=23 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Text mining ===
The increase in available biological publications led to the issue of the increase in difficulty in searching through and compiling all the relevant available information on a given topic across all sources. This task is known as [[knowledge extraction]]. This is necessary for biological data collection which can then in turn be fed into machine learning algorithms to generate new biological knowledge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krallinger|first=Martin|last2=Erhardt|first2=Ramon Alonso-Allende|last3=Valencia|first3=Alfonso|date=March 15, 2005|title=Text-mining approaches in molecular biology and biomedicine|journal=Drug Discovery Today|volume=10|issue=6|pages=439–445|doi=10.1016/S1359-6446(05)03376-3|pmid=15808823}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machine learning can be used for this knowledge extraction task using techniques such as [[natural language processing]] to extract the useful information from human-generated reports in a database. [[Text Nailing]], an alternative approach to machine learning, capable of extracting features from clinical narrative notes was introduced in 2017.

This technique has been applied to the search for novel drug targets, as this task requires the examination of information stored in biological databases and journals.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Annotations of proteins in protein databases often do not reflect the complete known set of knowledge of each protein, so additional information must be extracted from biomedical literature. Machine learning has been applied to automatic annotation of the function of genes and proteins, determination of the [[Protein targeting|subcellular localization of a protein]], analysis of [[Gene expression|DNA-expression arrays]], large-scale [[List of protein interactions|protein interaction]] analysis, and molecule interaction analysis.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Another application of text mining is the detection and visualization of distinct DNA regions given sufficient reference data.&lt;ref name="sing"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pratas|first=D|author2=Hosseini, M|author3=Silva, R|author4= Pinho, A|author5= Ferreira, P|title=Visualization of Distinct DNA Regions of the Modern Human Relatively to a Neanderthal Genome|journal=Iberian Conference on Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis.

'''Diploidization''' is the process of converting a polyploid genome back into a diploid one. [[Polyploid]]y is a product of whole genome duplication (WGD) and is followed by diploidization as a result of genome shock.&lt;ref&gt;Conant, G.C., J. A. Birchler, and J. C. Pires Dosage, duplication, and diploidization: clarifying the interplay of multiple models for duplicate gene evolution over time.

Yesterday’s Polyploids and the Mystery of Diploidization Nat Rev Genet. 2001 May;2(5): 333-41.&lt;/ref&gt; The plant kingdom has undergone multiple events of polyploidization followed by diploidization in both ancient and recent lineages.&lt;ref&gt;Conant, G.C., J. A. Birchler, and J. C. Pires Dosage, duplication, and diploidization: clarifying the interplay of multiple models for duplicate gene evolution over time. Current Opinion in Plant Biology 2014, 19: 91–98&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been hypothesized that vertebrate genomes have gone through two rounds of [[paleopolyploidy]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Kenneth H. Yesterday's Polyploids and the Mystery of Diploidization Nat Rev Genet. 2001 May;2(5): 333–341.&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanisms of diploidization are poorly understood but patterns of chromosomal loss and evolution of novel genes are observed in the process.

== Elimination of duplicated genes ==

Upon the formation of new polyploids, large sections of DNA are rapidly lost from one genome.&lt;ref&gt;Conant, G.C., J. A. Birchler, and J. C. Pires Dosage, duplication, and diploidization: clarifying the interplay of multiple models for duplicate gene evolution over time. Current Opinion in Plant Biology 2014, 19: 91–98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Feldman, Moshe and Avraham A. Levy Genome evolution in allopolyploid wheat—a revolutionary reprogramming followed by gradual changes. J. Genet. Genomics 2009, 36: 511–518&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Hufton, A. L. and G. Panopoulou Polyploidy and genome restructuring: a variety of outcomes Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development 2009, 19: 600–606&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of DNA effectively achieves two purposes. First, the eliminated copy restores the normal gene dosage in the diploid organism.&lt;ref&gt;Conant, G.C., J. A. Birchler, and J. C. Pires Dosage, duplication, and diploidization: clarifying the interplay of multiple models for duplicate gene evolution over time. Current Opinion in Plant Biology 2014, 19: 91–98&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the changes in chromosomal genetic structure increase the divergence of the homoeologous chromosomes (similar chromosomes from inter-species hybrid) and promotes [[homologous chromosome]] pairing.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Moshe and Avraham A. Levy Genome evolution in allopolyploid wheat—a revolutionary reprogramming followed by gradual changes. J. Genet. Genomics 2009, 36: 511–518&lt;/ref&gt; Both are important in terms of adjusting to the induced genome shock.

== Evolution of genes to ensure correct chromosome pairing ==

There have been rare events in which genes that ensure proper chromosome pairing have evolved shortly after polyploidization. One such gene, Ph1, exists in hexaploid wheat.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez-Perez, E,, P. Shaw and G. Moore The Ph1 locus is needed to ensure specific somatic and meiotic centromere association Nature 411: 204-207&lt;/ref&gt; These genes keep the two sets of genomes separately by either spatially separating them or giving them a unique chromatin identity to facilitate recognition from its homologous pair. This prevents the need of rapid gene loss to speed up homeologous chromosome diversification.

== Drive for diploidization ==
; Coordinate inter-genomic gene expression
: Duplicated genes often result in increased dosage of gene products. Doubled dosages are sometimes lethal to the organism thus the two genome copies must coordinate in a structured fashion to maintain normal nuclear activity.&lt;ref&gt;Conant, G.C., J. A. Birchler, and J. C. Pires Dosage, duplication, and diploidization: clarifying the interplay of multiple models for duplicate gene evolution over time. Current Opinion in Plant Biology 2014, 19: 91–98&lt;/ref&gt; Many mechanisms of diploidization promote this coordination.
; Maintain intra-genomic chromosome pairing at meiosis
: Chromosome pairing during meiosis is a significant challenge for polyploids. Homoeologous chromosomes with similar genetic content may pair with each other resulting in trivalent or tetravalent interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Hufton, A. L. and G. Panopoulou Polyploidy and genome restructuring: a variety of outcomes Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development 2009, 19: 600–606&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution of these structures results in chromosome breakage, rearrangement, and gamete infertility. Diploidization is often required to restore the cell’s ability to stably go through meiosis.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Moshe and Avraham A. Levy Genome evolution in allopolyploid wheat—a revolutionary reprogramming followed by gradual changes. J. Genet. Genomics 2009, 36: 511–518&lt;/ref&gt;
; Reduce costs of maintaining large, duplicated genomes
: Large genomes are costly to synthesize during replication and hard to maintain.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Moshe and Avraham A. Levy Genome evolution in allopolyploid wheat—a revolutionary reprogramming followed by gradual changes. J. Genet. Genomics 2009, 36: 511–518&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of duplicated genes during diploidization effectively reduces the overall size of the genome.

== Revolutionary vs. evolutionary changes ==
Once a polyploid is made, either synthetically or naturally, the genome goes through a period of "genome shock". Genome shock can be defined as a stage in which the genome experiences massive reorganization and structural changes to deal with the external stress (X-ray damage, chromosome duplication, etc.) imposed upon the genome.&lt;ref&gt;McClintock, Barbara The significance of responses of the genome to challenge Science 1984, 226: 792–801&lt;/ref&gt; Such changes are termed '''revolutionary changes''' and occur early in the process of diploidization.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Moshe and Avraham A. Levy Genome evolution in allopolyploid wheat—a revolutionary reprogramming followed by gradual changes. J. Genet. Genomics 2009, 36: 511–518&lt;/ref&gt; Revolutionary changes ensure that the organism has a stable genome that can be passed to its progeny.

At the end of this process, certain duplicated genes may be preserved thus allowing evolution to shape them into novel functions. This is commonly termed as neofunctionalization. The mechanism of retaining duplicated genes is poorly understood. It has been hypothesized that dosage balance may play a key role in shaping the evolutionary fates of duplicated genes.&lt;ref&gt; Conant, G.C., J. A. Birchler, and J. C. Pires Dosage, duplication, and diploidization: clarifying the interplay of multiple models for duplicate gene evolution over time. Current Opinion in Plant Biology 2014, 19: 91–98&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary changes refer to the long process of converting duplicated genes into diverse, functional gene derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Moshe and Avraham A. Levy Genome evolution in allopolyploid wheat—a revolutionary reprogramming followed by gradual changes. J. Genet. Genomics 2009, 36: 511–518&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms ==
There are many ways in which a polyploid organism can convert back to a diploid status. This is usually achieved by elimination of duplicated genes. The main goals of diploidization are: (1) To ensure proper gene dosage; and (2) to maintain stable cellular division processes. It should be noted that this process does not need to occur rapidly for all chromosomes in one or few steps. In recent polyploid events, segments of the genome may still remain in a tetraploid status. In other words, diploidization is a long ongoing process that is shaped by both intrinsic and evolutionary drives.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Kenneth H. Yesterday’s Polyploids and the Mystery of Diploidization Nat Rev Genet. 2001 May;2(5): 333–341.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abnormal chromosome pairing ===
Normally, homologous chromosomes pair up in bivalents during meiosis and separate into different daughter cells. However, when multiple copies of similar chromosomes are present in the nucleus, homeologous chromosomes can also pair with homologous chromosomes resulting in the formation of trivalents or multivalents.&lt;ref&gt;Hufton, A. L. and G. Panopoulou Polyploidy and genome restructuring: a variety of outcomes Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development 2009, 19: 600–606&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of multivalents results in unequal division of the chromosomes and lead to daughter cells lacking one or few chromosomes.

=== Illegitimate recombination ===
When homeologous chromosomes pair up though bivalents or multivalents, illegitimate genetic crossovers may occur.&lt;ref&gt;Hufton, A. L. and G. Panopoulou Polyploidy and genome restructuring: a variety of outcomes Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development 2009, 19: 600–606&lt;/ref&gt; Since the chromosomes may differ in genetic structure and content, segments of the chromosome may be shuffled around resulting in massive gene loss. Additionally, [[illegitimate recombination]]s may also result in dicentric chromosomes lead to chromosome breakage during anaphase.&lt;ref&gt;Hufton, A. L. and G. Panopoulou Polyploidy and genome restructuring: a variety of outcomes Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development 2009, 19: 600–606&lt;/ref&gt; This further contributes to gene loss on duplicated chromosomes.

=== Relaxed selective pressure on duplicated genes ===
The duplicated copies of a gene are commonly non-essential to the plant’s ability to maintain normal growth and development. Therefore, one copy is generally free to mutate/be lost from the genome.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Moshe and Avraham A. Levy Genome evolution in allopolyploid wheat—a revolutionary reprogramming followed by gradual changes. J. Genet. Genomics 2009, 36: 511–518&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Kenneth H. Yesterday’s Polyploids and the Mystery of Diploidization Nat Rev Genet. 2001 May;2(5): 333-41.&lt;/ref&gt; This contributes to gene loss through the massive chromosome reorganization events during genome shock.

=== Neofunctionalization ===
As mentioned earlier, duplicated genes are under relaxed selective pressure. Thus it may also be subject to [[neofunctionalization]], the process in which a duplicated gene obtains a novel function.

Plant physiologist [[Folke Skoog]] would be instrumental in bringing the Biotron to the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]]. A colleague of [[Frits Went]] at Caltech, Skoog oversaw the two proposals the university submitted to the Botanical Society in 1959.&lt;ref name=munns /&gt;{{rp|203}} The interdisciplinary nature and scope of the project quickly led it to becoming Madison's most expensive facility at around 4.2 million dollars.&lt;ref name=munns /&gt;{{rp|202}} It was up to Harold Senn, appointed director of the Biotron to concentrate on assembling funding, which he was able to accomplish by January 1963, with the [[Ford Foundation]] and [[National Institute of Health]] contributing to the project.&lt;ref name=munns /&gt;{{rp|210}}

The Biotron was officially dedicated on September 18, 1970 with many experiments under precise controlled environmental conditions already under study, such as a lizard in the Palm Springs desert or black-eyed peas growing in hot and humid Nigeria.&lt;ref name=times1970&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/19/archives/environment-center-dedicated-wisconsins-biotron-permits-research-in.html|title=Environment Center Dedicated|last=Wilford|first=John Noble|date=1970-09-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When finally completed in 1971, the Biotron contained over fifty rooms with many able to variate temperature from as low as -25C to as high as 50C with humidity adjustable anywhere from 1%-100%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biotron manual for investigators|last=Senn|first=H.

Senn supposedly spent an additional $3,000 of the Biotron budget on increasing the computer's memory an extra 4 [[kilobytes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biotron|url=http://www.worldoftrons.com/blog/2017/2/22/biotron|website=World of Trons|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Biotron went through a period of decline in the 1980s, unlike other facilities it never closed.

The Biotron has 45 rooms that are capable of simulating a range of environmental variables with precision and control. These rooms feature separate air handling and control over the temperature, humidity, and lighting. Some rooms specialize in isolation from sound and vibration, electromagnetic radiation, or pressure.&lt;ref name=times1970 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://biotron.wisc.edu/controlled-environments/|title=Controlled Environments|website=Biotron Laboratory|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biological Hermeneutics''' is the transdisciplinary study of written and printed media using artistic and scientific methods to trace the biological history of the text. For more on transdisciplinary study see [[transdisciplinarity]].

== History ==
Biological Hermeneutics came into being after the development of the [[microscope]] during the 17th century. The most celebrated practitioner [[Robert Hooke]] devoted two of his 'Schema' of his ground breaking book ''Micrographia'' to the study of the [[Microbiomes of the built environment|microbiome]] of the book.

Schema 12  was drawn from studying the red covers of a ‘small book’ which he judged to be made of ‘Sheeps skin’, he found:&lt;blockquote&gt;… a small white spot of hairy mould, multitudes of which I found to bespeck &amp; whiten [the book]. These spots appear’d, through a good Microscope, to be a very pretty shap’d Vegetative body, which, from almost the same part of the Leather, shot out multitudes of small long cylindrical and transparent stalks …&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/h/hooke/robert/micrographia/observ20.html|title=Micrographia, by Robert Hooke : observ20|website=ebooks.adelaide.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schema 33 is dedicated to '''the study of the small silver coloured'' book-worm'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/h/hooke/robert/micrographia/observ52.html|title=Micrographia, by Robert Hooke : Observ. LII. Of the small Silver-colour'd Book-worm.|website=ebooks.adelaide.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the discipline stalled however with the ascendance of [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] to the presidency of the Royal Society where he 'did much to obscure Hooke'.

A collection of books maintaining the investigation of the transdiscipline can be found at [[Chetham's Library]] where the practice was developed from Hooke's initial investigations through the collecting policy of successive librarians who 'set out to acquire a major collection of books and manuscripts that would cover the whole range of available knowledge and would rival the college libraries of Oxford and Cambridge'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://library.chethams.com/history/|title=Chetham's Library {{!}} History|work=Chetham's Library|access-date=2017-07-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to collect biological material for later study books were sent out into the community as parish libraries. Gorton library is the last surviving example and has yet to be investigated using Biological Hermeneutic techniques.

In 1831 the foundation of the British Association for the Advancement of Science led to the popularisation of science and enabled a wider group to undertake their own investigations outside of the Royal Society creating a space for the further development of the practice.

'''Neural computation''' is the hypothetical information processing performed by networks of [[neuron]]s. Neural computation is affiliated with the philosophical tradition known as [[Computational theory of mind]], also referred to as computationalism, which advances the thesis that neural computation explains cognition. The first persons to propose an account of neural activity as being computational was [[Warren Sturgis McCulloch|Warren McCullock]] and [[Walter Pitts]] in their seminal 1943 paper, A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity. There are three general branches of computationalism, including classicism, [[connectionism]], and [[computational neuroscience]]. All three branches agree that cognition is computation, however they disagree on what sorts of computations constitute cognition. The classicism tradition believes that computation in the brain is digital, analogous with digital computing. Both connectionism and computational neuroscience do not require that the computations which realize cognition are necessarily digital computations. However, the two branches greatly disagree upon which sorts of experimental data should be used to construct explanatory models of cognitive phenomena. Connectionists rely upon behavioral evidence to construct models to explain cognitive phenomenon, whereas computational neuroscience leverages neuroanatomical and neurophysiological information to construct mathematical models which explain cognition.

When comparing the three main traditions of the computational theory of mind, as well as the different possible forms of computation in the brain, it is helpful to define what we mean by computation in a general sense. Computation is the processing of vehicles, otherwise known as variables or entities, according to a set of rules. A rule in this sense is simply an instruction for executing a manipulation on the current state of the variable, in order to produce an specified output. In other words, a rule dictates which output to produce given a certain input to the computing system. A computing system is a mechanism whose components must be functionally organized to process the vehicles in accordance with the established set of rules. The types of vehicles processed by a computing system determines which type of computations it performs. Traditionally, in cognitive science there have been two proposed types of computation related to neural activity - [[Digital computer|digital]] and [[Analog computer|analog]], with the vast majority of theoretical work incorporating a digital understanding of cognition. Computing systems which perform digital computation are functionally organized to execute operations on strings of digits with respect to the type and location of the digit on the string. It has been argued that neural spike train signaling implements some form of digital computation, since [[Action potential|neural spikes]] may be considered as discrete units or digits, like 0 or 1 - the neuron either fires an action potential or it does not. Accordingly, neural spike trains could be seen as strings of digits. Alternatively, analog computing systems perform manipulations on non-discrete, irreducibly continuous variables, that is, entities which vary continuously as a function of time. These sorts of operations are characterized by systems of differential equations.

Neural computation can be studied for example by building [[models of neural computation]].

There is a scientific journal dedicated to this subject, ''[[Neural Computation (journal)|Neural Computation]]''.

[[Artificial neural network]]s (ANN) is subfield of the research area [[machine learning]]. Work on ANNs has been somewhat inspired by knowledge of neural computation.

'''Infectious tolerance''' is a term referring to a phenomenon where a tolerance-inducing state is transferred from one cell population to another. It can be induced in many ways; although it is often artificially induced, it is a natural ''in vivo'' process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cobbold|first=S.|last2=Waldmann|first2=H.|date=October 1998|title=Infectious tolerance|journal=Current Opinion in Immunology|volume=10|issue=5|pages=518–524|issn=0952-7915|pmid=9794831}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of research deal with the development of a strategy utilizing this phenomenon in transplantation immunology. The goal is to achieve long-term tolerance of the [[Transplant rejection|transplant]] through short-term therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kendal|first=Adrian R.|last2=Waldmann|first2=Herman|date=October 2010|title=Infectious tolerance: therapeutic potential|journal=Current Opinion in Immunology|volume=22|issue=5|pages=560–565|doi=10.1016/j.coi.2010.08.002|issn=1879-0372|pmid=20829013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The term "infectious tolerance" was originally used by Gershon and Kondo in 1970&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gershon|first=R. K.|last2=Kondo|first2=K.|date=December 1971|title=Infectious immunological tolerance|journal=Immunology|volume=21|issue=6|pages=903–914|issn=0019-2805|pmc=1408252|pmid=4943147}}&lt;/ref&gt; for suppression of naive lymphocyte populations by cells with regulatory function and for the ability to transfer a state of unresponsiveness from one animal to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gershon|first=R.

Later developed new tolerogenic strategies have provided strong evidence to re-evaluate the phenomenon of T cell mediated suppression, in particular the use of non-depleting anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies, demonstrating that neither [[thymus]] nor [[clonal deletion]] is necessary to induce tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Qin|first=S.

This ensures the long duration of once induced tolerance, for as long as the donor antigens are present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Qin|first=S.|last2=Cobbold|first2=S.

[[File:Immunoregulation by regulatory T cells (Treg)..jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Treg migrate to the grafted tissue. Activated Treg convert ATP released by inflamed tissues to adenosine via the ectoenzymes CD39 and CD73. Local adenosine could contribute to the initial “privileged” microenvironment. Treg also secrete TGF-β and IL-10 which inhibit the maturation and migration of dendritic cells (DC). These “decommissioned” DC can secrete catabolic enzymes for depletion of essential amino acids (EAA) and, therefore, induce apoptosis of effector T cells. Moreover, the “privileged” tissues could release pro-apoptotic galectin-9 which binds to TIM-3 expressed by effector T cells such as Th1 and Th17. This further amplifies the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Each of these components within the graft can further reinforce the local anti-inflammatory state such that any naive T cell, migrating into this area, will be converted to induced Treg (iTreg) through infectious tolerance. The iTreg then expand and further suppress immunity in the “privileged” microenvironment.]]

Glycogen is the analogue of [[starch]], a glucose [[polymer]] that functions as energy storage in [[plant]]s. It has a structure similar to [[amylopectin]] (a component of starch), but is more extensively branched and compact than starch. Both are white [[powder (substance)|powders]] in their dry state. Glycogen is found in the form of granules in the [[cytosol]]/cytoplasm in many [[cell (biology)|cell]] types, and plays an important role in the [[glucose cycle]]. Glycogen forms an [[energy]] reserve that can be quickly mobilized to meet a sudden need for glucose, but one that is less compact than the energy reserves of [[triglycerides]] (lipids). As such it is also found as storage reserve in many parasitic protozoa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryley|first1=JF|title=Studies on the metabolism of the protozoa. 5.

Glycogen is a branched [[biopolymer]] consisting of linear chains of [[glucose]] [[Residue (chemistry)|residues]] with an average chain length of approximately 8–12 glucose units.&lt;ref&gt;Manners, D. J. Carbohydr. Polym. 1991, 16, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Glucose units are linked together linearly by α(1→4) [[glycosidic bond]]s from one glucose to the next. Branches are linked to the chains from which they are branching off by α(1→6) glycosidic bonds between the first glucose of the new branch and a glucose on the stem chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Biochemistry |edition = 7th, International |last = Berg, Tymoczko &amp; Stryer |year = 2012 |publisher = W. H. Freeman |isbn = 978-1429203142 |page = 338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the way glycogen is synthesised, every glycogen granule has at its core a [[glycogenin]] protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Biochemistry |edition = 7th, International |last = Berg|year = 2012 |publisher = W. H. Freeman |isbn = |page = 650|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glycogen in muscle, liver, and fat cells is stored in a hydrated form, composed of three or four parts of water per part of glycogen associated with 0.45&amp;nbsp;[[Molar concentration#Units|millimoles]] (18&amp;nbsp;mg) of potassium per gram of glycogen.&lt;ref name="pmid1615908"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kreitzman SN, Coxon AY, Szaz KF | title=Glycogen storage: illusions of easy weight loss, excessive weight regain, and distortions in estimates of body composition | journal=[[The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]] | volume=56 | issue=1 Suppl | year=1992 | pages=292s–93s  | url = http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/56/1/292S.full.pdf | id= | pmid=1615908| doi=10.1093/ajcn/56.1.292S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glucose is an osmotic molecule, and can have profound effects on osmotic pressure in high concentrations possibly leading to cell damage or death if stored in the cell without being modified.&lt;ref name="worldcat.org"/&gt;  Glycogen is a non-osmotic molecule, so it can be used as a solution to storing glucose in the cell without disrupting osmotic pressure.&lt;ref name="worldcat.org"/&gt;

==Functions==

===Liver===
As a meal containing [[carbohydrate]]s or protein is eaten and [[digestion|digested]], [[blood glucose]] levels rise, and the [[pancreas]] secretes [[insulin]]. Blood glucose from the [[portal vein]] enters liver cells ([[hepatocyte]]s). Insulin acts on the hepatocytes to stimulate the action of several [[enzyme]]s, including [[glycogen synthase]]. Glucose molecules are added to the chains of glycogen as long as both insulin and glucose remain plentiful. In this [[postprandial]] or "fed" state, the liver takes in more glucose from the blood than it releases.

After a meal has been digested and glucose levels begin to fall, insulin secretion is reduced, and glycogen synthesis stops. When it is needed for [[Food energy|energy]], glycogen is broken down and converted again to glucose. [[Glycogen phosphorylase]] is the primary enzyme of glycogen breakdown. For the next 8–12 hours, glucose derived from liver glycogen is the primary source of blood glucose used by the rest of the body for fuel.

[[Glucagon]], another hormone produced by the pancreas, in many respects serves as a countersignal to insulin. In response to insulin levels being below normal (when blood levels of glucose begin to fall below the normal range), glucagon is secreted in increasing amounts and stimulates both [[glycogenolysis]] (the breakdown of glycogen) and [[gluconeogenesis]] (the production of glucose from other sources).

===Muscle===
[[Skeletal muscle|Muscle cell]] glycogen appears to function as an immediate reserve source of available glucose for muscle cells. Other cells that contain small amounts use it locally, as well. As muscle cells lack [[glucose-6-phosphatase]], which is required to pass glucose into the blood, the glycogen they store is available solely for internal use and is not shared with other cells. This is in contrast to liver cells, which, on demand, readily do break down their stored glycogen into glucose and send it through the blood stream as fuel for other organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oregonstate.edu/instruct/bb450/summer09/lecture/glycogennotes.html|title=Glycogen Biosynthesis; Glycogen Breakdown|website=oregonstate.edu|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Glycogen was discovered by [[Claude Bernard]]. His experiments showed that the liver contained a substance that could give rise to reducing sugar by the action of a "ferment" in the liver. By 1857, he described the isolation of a substance he called "''la matière glycogène''", or "sugar-forming substance". Soon after the discovery of glycogen in the liver, A. Sanson found that muscular tissue also contains glycogen. The empirical formula for glycogen of ({{chem|C|6|H|10|O|5}})&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; was established by [[August Kekulé|Kekulé]] in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=F. G. Young |title=Claude Bernard and the Discovery of Glycogen|journal=British Medical Journal |volume=1 |issue=5033 (Jun. 22, 1957) |pages=1431–37 |year=1957 |jstor=25382898 |doi=10.1136/bmj.1.5033.1431|pmid=13436813|pmc=1973429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metabolism==

===Synthesis===
{{Main|Glycogenesis}}

Glycogen synthesis is, unlike its breakdown, [[endergonic]]—it requires the input of energy. Energy for glycogen synthesis comes from [[uridine triphosphate]] (UTP), which reacts with [[glucose-1-phosphate]], forming [[UDP-glucose]], in a reaction catalysed by [[UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase]]. Glycogen is synthesized from monomers of [[UDP-glucose]] initially by the protein [[glycogenin]], which has two [[tyrosine]] anchors for the reducing end of glycogen, since glycogenin is a homodimer. After about eight glucose molecules have been added to a tyrosine residue, the enzyme [[glycogen synthase]] progressively lengthens the glycogen chain using UDP-glucose, adding α(1→4)-bonded glucose to the reducing end of the glycogen chain.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, D. (2013) Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry, 6th ed., W.H. Freeman and Company (p. 618)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[glycogen branching enzyme]] catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of six or seven glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C-6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule. The branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 residues, and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains.

===Breakdown===
{{Main|Glycogenolysis}}
Glycogen is cleaved from the nonreducing ends of the chain by the enzyme [[glycogen phosphorylase]] to produce monomers of glucose-1-phosphate:

[[File:Glycogen phosphorylase stereo.png|600px|center|Action of Glycogen Phosphorylase on Glycogen]]

In vivo, phosphorolysis proceeds in the direction of glycogen breakdown because the ratio of phosphate and glucose-1-phosphate is usually greater than 100.&lt;ref&gt;Stryer, L. (1988) Biochemistry, 3rd ed., Freeman (p. 451)&lt;/ref&gt; Glucose-1-phosphate is then converted to [[G6P|glucose 6-phosphate]] (G6P) by [[phosphoglucomutase]]. A special [[glycogen debranching enzyme|debranching enzyme]] is needed to remove the α(1-6) branches in branched glycogen and reshape the chain into a linear polymer. The G6P monomers produced have three possible fates:
* G6P can continue on the [[glycolysis]] pathway and be used as fuel.
* G6P can enter the [[pentose phosphate pathway]] via the enzyme [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]] to produce NADPH and 5-carbon sugars.
* In the liver and kidney, G6P can be dephosphorylated back to glucose by the enzyme [[glucose 6-phosphatase]]. This is the final step in the [[gluconeogenesis]] pathway.

==Clinical relevance==

===Disorders of glycogen metabolism===
The most common disease in which glycogen [[metabolism]] becomes abnormal is [[diabetes]], in which, because of abnormal amounts of insulin, liver glycogen can be abnormally accumulated or depleted. Restoration of normal glucose metabolism usually normalizes glycogen metabolism, as well.

In [[hypoglycemia]] caused by excessive insulin, liver glycogen levels are high, but the high insulin levels prevent the [[glycogenolysis]] necessary to maintain normal blood sugar levels. [[Glucagon]] is a common treatment for this type of hypoglycemia.

Various [[inborn error of metabolism|inborn errors of metabolism]] are caused by deficiencies of enzymes necessary for glycogen synthesis or breakdown. These are collectively referred to as [[glycogen storage disease]]s.

===Glycogen depletion and endurance exercise===
{{See also|Central nervous system fatigue}}
Long-distance athletes, such as [[Marathon (sport)|marathon]] runners, [[Cross-country skiing|cross-country skiers]], and [[cyclist]]s, often experience glycogen depletion, where almost all of the athlete's glycogen stores are depleted after long periods of exertion without sufficient carbohydrate consumption. This phenomenon is referred to as "[[hitting the wall]]".

Glycogen depletion can be forestalled in three possible ways. First, during exercise, carbohydrates with the highest possible rate of conversion to blood glucose (high [[glycemic index]]) are ingested continuously. The best possible outcome of this strategy replaces about 35% of glucose consumed at heart rates above about 80% of maximum. Second, through endurance training adaptations and specialized regimens (e.g. fasting low-intensity endurance training), the body can condition type I muscle fibers to improve both fuel use efficiency and workload capacity to increase the percentage of fatty acids used as fuel,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/training/methods-of-endurance-training-part-1.html | title=Methods of Endurance Training Part 1| date=2009-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/qa-steady-state-vs-tempo-training-and-fat-loss.html | title=Steady State vs. Tempo Training and Fat Loss| date=2008-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|reason = http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/training/methods-of-endurance-training-part-1.html

Third, by consuming large quantities of carbohydrates after depleting glycogen stores as a result of exercise or diet, the body can increase storage capacity of intramuscular glycogen stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.directlyfitness.com/store/carbing-cyclical-ketogenic-diet/ |last=McDonald |first=Lyle |title=Research Review: An In-Depth Look Into Carbing Up On The Cyclical Ketogenic Diet |access-date=19 February 2017|date=2012-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Lyle.

When experiencing glycogen debt, athletes often experience extreme [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] to the point that it is difficult to move.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3252">A '''bioactive terrarium''' (or vivarium) is a [[terrarium]] for housing one or more terrestrial [[animal]]s which also includes populations of small [[invertebrate]]s and [[microorganism]]s to consume and break down the waste products of the primary species.  This population of [[decomposer]]s is colloquially referred to as the "cleanup crew" (abbr. "CUC"), and can include terrestrial [[isopod]]s, [[springtail]]s, [[earthworm]]s, [[millipede]]s, and various [[beetle]]s as determined by compatibility with the habitat of the primary species (e.g. tropical rainforest vs. desert).  In a fully functional bioactive terrarium, all of the waste products will be broken down by the cleanup crew, eliminating the need for cage cleaning and preventing odors.  While most bioactive terrariums are also naturalistic (with live plants, soil, lighting, and naturalistic decor), a terrarium may be bioactive without being naturalistic, and naturalistic without being bioactive).

==Enclosure==
Although any enclosure can be made bioactive by addition of a "cleanup crew" and appropriate substrate, such enclosures are almost always naturalistic terraria constructed of PVC, wood, glass and/or acrylic; bioactive enclosures in "rack" style caging is uncommon. 

==Substrate==
Bioactive enclosures require some form of particulate substrate to provide habitat for the cleanup crew.  The choice of substrate is typically determined by the habitat of the primary species (e.g. jungle vs desert), and created by mixing a variety of components such as organic topsoil (free of pesticides and non-biological fertilizers), peat, coco fiber, sand, long-fiber sphagnum moss, cypress mulch, and orchid bark in varying proportions.  In wet habitats, there is typically a layer of coarse rocks beneath the substrate to allow drainage, separated from the overlying substrate with a fine plastic mesh.  Additionally, some bioactive terraria include leaflitter, which can serve as food and microhabitat for the cleanup crew.

==Cleanup Crew==
[[File:Bioactive Terrarium Cleanup Crew.jpg|thumb|Isopods eating snake feces in a bioactive terrarium]]
Waste products of the primary species are consumed by a variety of smaller invertebrates, termed a "cleanup crew".  These can include terrestrial [[isopod]]s, [[springtail]]s, [[earthworm]]s, [[millipede]]s, and various [[beetle]]s, with different species being preferred in different habitats - the cleanup crew for a tropical rainforest bioactive terrarium may rely primarily on springtails, isopods, and earthworms, while a desert habitat would use mostly beetles.  If the primary species is insectivorous, they may consume insects in the cleanup crew, and thus the cleanup crew must have sufficient retreats to avoid be completely depopulated.

Additionally, bioactive terraria typically have a flourishing population of bacteria and other microorganisms which break down the wastes of the cleanup crew and primary species.  Fungi may occur, and, if non-toxic, may provide food for the cleanup crew and primary species.

In [[maximum parsimony]], an '''informative site''' is a position in the relevant set of sequences at which there are at least two different [[character state]]s at that point in the sequences, and each of those states occurs in at least two of the sequences. Character states can take on multiple types of data, including [[Morphology_(biology)|morphological]] (such as the presence of wings, tentacles, etc.) or [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular information]] such as sequences of [[DNA]] or [[proteins]].
[[File:Parsimony informative v1.svg|thumb|Example of parsimony informative sites. In phylogenetics, parsimony informative sites are those with at least two states. Here, this is sites 2 and 4. Site 2 indicates a grouping of Species A and C, while site 4 indicates a grouping of Species A and B. Because these two sites conflict, other analyses (such as [[maximum likelihood]]) are needed to resolve the phylogenetic tree of these four species.]]

&lt;!---Extant taxon is now a redirect here, so this article needs to be about that topic now too...---&gt;
'''Neontology''' is a part of [[biology]] that, in contrast to [[paleontology]], deals with living (or, more generally, ''[[Holocene|recent]]'') [[organisms]]. It is the study of '''extant taxa''' (singular: extant [[taxon]]): taxa (such as [[species]], [[genus|genera]] and [[family (biology)|families]]) with members still alive, as opposed to (all) being [[Extinction|extinct]]. For example:
* The [[moose]] (''Alces alces'') is an extant species, and the [[dodo]] is an extinct species.
* In the group of [[mollusc]]s known as the [[cephalopod]]s, {{as of|1987|lc=y}} there were approximately 600 extant species and 7,500 extinct species.&lt;ref name="Essential"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essential readings in evolutionary biology|others=Ayala, Francisco José, 1934-, Avise, John C.|isbn=978-1421413051|location=Baltimore|oclc=854285705|last1 = Ayala|first1 = Francisco J.|last2=Avise|first2=John C.|date=2014-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A taxon can be classified as extinct if it is broadly agreed or certified that no members of the group are still alive. Conversely, an extinct taxon can be reclassified as extant if there are new discoveries of extant species ("[[Lazarus species]]"), or if previously-known extant species are reclassified as members of the taxon.

Most biologists, [[zoology|zoologists]], and [[botanist]]s are in practice neontologists, and the term neontologist is used largely by paleontologists referring to non-[[Paleontology|paleontologists]]. [[Stephen Jay Gould]] said of neontology:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All professions maintain their [[parochialism]]s, and I trust that nonpaleontological readers will forgive our major [[wikt:manifestation|manifestation]]. We are paleontologists, so we need a name to contrast ourselves with all you folks who study modern [[organisms]] in [[human]] or [[ecology|ecological]] [[time]]. You therefore become neontologists. We do recognize the unbalanced and parochial nature of this [[Dichotomy|dichotomous]] division.&lt;ref name="Pattern"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pattern and Process in Cultural Evolution|last=Shennan|first=Stephan|publisher=University of California Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0520255999|location=|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Neontological evolutionary biology has a temporal perspective between 100 to 1000 years. Neontology's fundamental basis relies on models of natural selection as well as speciation. Neontology's methods, when compared to evolutionary [[paleontology]], has a greater emphasis on experiments. There are more frequent discontinuities present in paleontology than in neontology, because paleontology involves extinct taxa. Neontology has organisms actually present and available to sample and perform research on.&lt;ref name="Essential"/&gt; Neontology's research method uses [[cladistics]] to examine [[morphology (biology)|morphologies]] and [[genetics]]. Neontology data has more emphasis on genetic data and the population structure than paleontology does.&lt;ref name="Pattern"/&gt;

==Information gaps==
When the scientific community accepted the [[synthetic theory of evolution]], [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomies]] became [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Molecular evolutionary genetics|last=Masatoshi.|first=Nei|date=1987|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0231063210|location=New York|oclc=13945914}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, information gaps arose within the fossil record of species- especially in Homo sapiens. The anthropologists who accepted the synthetic theory, reject the idea of an "ape man" because the concept had mistaken paleontology with neontology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of the history of science|others=Bynum, W. F. (William F.), 1943-, Browne, E. J. (E. Janet), 1950-, Porter, Roy, 1946-2002|isbn=978-0691614717|location=Princeton, New Jersey|oclc=889248984|last1 = Bynum|first1 = William F.|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An ape man, in actuality, would be a [[primate]] with traits that would represent anything in between Homo sapiens and the great apes. If the concept of an ape man was based on neontology, then our [[phenotype]] would resemble [[Bigfoot]]. Since the concept was based on paleontology, the idea of an ape man could possibly be represented by the fossil hominids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Creature of controversy : a candid look at the hidden world of Bigfoot research &amp; the men and women who hunt for a legend|last=A.|first=Shiel, Lisa|date=2011|publisher=Jacobsville Books|isbn=978-1934631423|location=Lake Linden, MI|oclc=818361503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extant taxa vs. extinct taxa==
Neontology studies extant (living) taxa and also recently extinct taxa, but declaring a taxon to be definitively extinct is difficult. Taxa that have previously been declared extinct may reappear over time. Species that were once considered extinct and then reappear unscathed are characterized by the term "The Lazarus effect", or are also called a Lazarus species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biogeosciences.u-bourgogne.fr/documents/articles_pdf/2001_Fara_GeolJ.pdf|title=What are Lazarus taxa?|last=Fara|first=Emmanuel|date=19 April 2000|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a study determined that 36% of supposed mammalian extinction had been resolved, while the other 64% had insufficient evidence to be declared extinct or had been rediscovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Extinctions in near time : causes, contexts, and consequences|others=MacPhee, R.

==Neontology importance==
Neontology's fundamental theories relies on biological models of [[natural selection]] and speciation that connects genes, the unit of heredity with the mechanism of evolution, natural selection.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} For example, researchers utilized neontological and paleontological datasets to study mouse dentitions compared with human dentitions. In order to understand the underlying genetic mechanisms that influences this variation between nonhuman primates and humans, neontological methods are applied to the research method. By incorporating neontology with different biological research methods, it can become clear how genetic mechanisms underlie major events in things such as primate evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Grieco|first=Theresa M.|last2=Rizk|first2=Oliver T.|last3=Hlusko|first3=Leslea J.|date=2012-09-07|title=Data from: A modular framework characterizes micro- and macroevolution of Old World monkey dentitions|chapter-url=http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.693j8|doi=10.5061/dryad.693j8|type=Data Set|publisher=Dryad Digital Repository|chapter=Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Arab culture}}
The '''''Kitāb al-Hayawān''''' (كتاب الحيوان; English: ''Book of Animals'') is an [[Arabic]] translation in 19 treatises (''maqālāt').

''[[History of Animals|Historia Animalium]]'' : treatises 1-10&lt;br /&gt;
''[[On the Parts of Animals|De Partibus Animalium]]'' : treatises 11-14&lt;br /&gt;
''[[Generation of Animals|De Generatione Animalium]]'' : treatises 15-19

While the book is often attributed to [[Abu Usman Al Jahiz]], the translator is unknown. The complete text is available only in [[manuscript]] form (in [[Tehran]]), but treatises 11-14 (''De Partibus'') have been edited as ''Ajzā’ al-hayawān (The Parts of Animals)''&lt;ref&gt;Edited by ‘Abd al-Rahmān al-Badawī. Kuwait: Wakālat al-matbū‘āt, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; and 15-19 (''De Generatione'') as ''Fī kawn al-hayawān (On the Being of Animals)''.&lt;ref&gt;''Fī kawn al-hayawān (On the Being of Animals)'' (Ed. J. Brugman and H.J. Drossaart Lulofs. Leiden: Brill, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

==References in philosophy==
The first known mention of the book appears in a text by the [[Arab]] philosopher [[Al-Kindī]] (d. 850). Ibn Sīnā ([[Avicenna]]) seems to have had direct knowledge of the book, as he paraphrased and commented upon the full text in his encyclopedic [[The Book of Healing|Al-Shifā’]]. In Spain, the 12th-century philosopher Ibn Bājja ([[Avempace]]) wrote on ''De Partibus'' and ''De Generatione''. It has been remarked that one usually finds references to the ''Historia'' in the Eastern Islamicate world, while the other two books are generally referred to in the West, and in conformity to this pattern, Ibn Rushd ([[Averroes]]), like Ibn Bājja, wrote commentaries on ''De Partibus'' and ''De Generatione'' (see below), in which he criticizes Ibn Sīnā’s interpretations.

==References in zoography==
[[File:Al-Jahiz - pages from Kitaab al Hayawaan 3.jpg|thumb|Page from the Kitāb al-Hayawān by [[Al-Jahiz]].]]

''Kitāb al-hayawān'' was known at least indirectly to several important zoographers including [[Al-Jahiz|Al-Jāhiz]] (''Kitāb al-hayawān''), Al-Mas‘ūdī (''Murawwaj al-dhahab''), [[Al-Tawhidi|Abū Hayyān al-Tawhīdī]] (''Al-Imtā‘ wa al-mu’ānasa''), Al-Qazwīnī (''‘Ajā’ib al-makhlūqāt''), and Al-Damīrī (''Hayāt al-hayawān''). They may have known the Aristotelian ''Kitāb al-hayawān'' at second hand from Arabic compendiums of selected passages from the book. The only extant compendium is the ''Maqāla tushtamalu ‘à la fusūl min kitāb al-hayawān'', attributed (probably falsely) to Mūsà bin Maymūn ([[Moses Maimonides]]), and the Greek ''Compendium'' of [[Nicolaus Damascenus]] was at least partially available by the 11th century.

==In the Christian West==
Finally, [[Michael Scot]]’s early 13th-century [[Latin]] translation of the ''Kitāb al-hayawān'', ''De Animalibus'', is worthy of mention as the vehicle of transmission into Western Europe. It was alleged by [[Roger Bacon]] that Scot "had appropriated to himself the credit of translations which more properly belonged to one Andreas the Jew." This may mean that he had help with the Arabic manuscript, or that he worked fully or in part from a [[Judaeo-Arabic]] or [[Hebrew]] version. Scot's ''De Animalibus'' is available in a partial edition.&lt;ref&gt;Scot, Michael. ''De Animalibus''. Vols 1-3. Leiden: Brill, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cultures have specific gender roles that are distinct from "man" and "woman," such as the [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijras]] of [[South Asia]]. These are often referred to as ''[[third gender]]s''.

[[Sexology|Sexologist]] [[John Money]] introduced the terminological distinction between [[Sex and gender distinction|biological sex and gender as a role]] in 1955. Before his work, it was uncommon to use the word ''gender'' to refer to anything but [[grammatical gender|grammatical categories]].&lt;ref name=udry /&gt;&lt;ref name="haig" /&gt; However, Money's meaning of the word did not become widespread until the 1970s, when [[feminist theory]] embraced the concept of a distinction between biological sex and the [[Social construction of gender difference|social construct of gender]].

In other contexts, including some areas of the social sciences, ''gender'' includes ''sex'' or replaces it.&lt;ref name="udry" /&gt;&lt;ref name="haig" /&gt; For instance, in non-human animal research, ''gender'' is commonly used to refer to the biological sex of the animals.&lt;ref name="haig" /&gt; This [[Semantic change|change in the meaning]] of gender can be traced to the 1980s. In 1993, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) started to use ''gender'' instead of ''sex''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM126835.pdf|title=Guideline for the Study and Evaluation of Gender Differences in the Clinical Evaluation of Drugs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 2011, the FDA reversed its position and began using ''sex ''as the biological classification and ''gender'' as "a person's self representation as male or female, or how that person is responded to by social institutions based on the individual's gender presentation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm283453.htm|title = Draft Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff Evaluation of Sex Differences in Medical Device Clinical Studies|date = 19 December 2011|accessdate = 3 August 2014|website = U.S. Food and Drug Administration|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[social science]]s have a branch devoted to [[gender studies]]. Other sciences, such as [[sexology]] and [[neuroscience]], are also interested in the subject. The social sciences sometimes approach gender as a [[Social constructionism|social construct]], and gender studies particularly do, while research in the [[natural science]]s investigates whether [[sex differences in humans|biological differences]] in males and females influence the development of gender in humans; both inform debate about how far biological differences influence the formation of gender identity. In some English literature, there is also a trichotomy between biological sex, psychological gender, and social gender role. This framework first appeared in a feminist paper on [[transsexualism]] in 1978.&lt;ref name="haig" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1978|title=Transsexualism and women: A critical perspective|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=4|issue=3|pages=97–106|doi=10.2307/3177542|jstor=3177542|author=Yudkin, M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology and usage ==
The modern English word ''gender'' comes from the [[Middle English]] ''gender'', ''gendre'', a [[loanword]] from [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] and [[Middle French]] ''gendre''. This, in turn, came from [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:genus#Latin|genus]]''. Both words mean "kind", "type", or "sort". They derive ultimately from a widely attested [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) [[Root (linguistics)|root]] ''g&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;n-'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius Pokorny|Pokorny, Julius]] (1959, reprinted in 1989) [https://web.archive.org/web/20071113165848/http://www.indo-european.nl/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=leiden&amp;morpho=0&amp;basename=%5Cdata%5Cie%5Cpokorny&amp;first=651 'gen'], in ''Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch'', Bern: Francke, pp. 373–375.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE143.html 'gen&lt;sup&gt;ə&lt;/sup&gt;-'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704184247/http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE143.html |date=4 July 2007 }}, in 'Appendix I: Indo-European Roots', to ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', Fourth Edition, (Boston: [[Houghton Mifflin]] Company, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;
which is also the source of ''kin'', ''kind'', ''king'', and many other English words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourdictionary.com/ahd/roots/zzg00600.html 'Gen']. Your Dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; It appears in Modern [[French language|French]] in the word ''[[genre]]'' (type, kind, also ''[[:fr:genre sexuel|genre sexuel]]'') and is related to the [[Greek language|Greek]] root ''gen-'' (to produce), appearing in ''[[gene]]'', ''[[wikt:genesis|genesis]]'', and ''[[oxygen]]''. The Oxford Etymological Dictionary of the English Language of 1882 defined ''gender'' as ''kind, breed, sex'', derived from the Latin ablative case of ''genus'', like ''genere natus'', which refers to birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/etymologicaldict00skeauoft/page/n5|title=An Etymological Dictionary of the English Language|last=Skeat|first=Walter William|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1882|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition of the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (OED1, Volume 4, 1900) notes the original meaning of ''gender'' as "kind" had already become obsolete.

The word was still widely used, however, in the specific sense of [[grammatical gender]] (the assignment of nouns to categories such as ''masculine'', ''feminine'' and ''neuter''). According to [[Aristotle]], this concept was introduced by the Greek philosopher [[Protagoras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rhetoric |author=Aristotle |authorlink=Aristotle |translator-last=Roberts |translator-first=William Rhys |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V_IMCohto0YC&amp;pg=PA127 |date=2004 |orig-year=1st pub.

In 1926, [[Henry Watson Fowler]] stated that the definition of the word pertained to this grammar-related meaning: {{quote|"Gender...is a grammatical term only. To talk of persons...of the masculine or feminine g[ender], meaning of the male or female sex, is either a jocularity (permissible or not according to context) or a blunder."&lt;ref&gt;[[Fowler's Modern English Usage]], 1926: p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The modern academic sense of the word, in the context of social roles of men and women, dates at least back to 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/77468 |title=''gender'', n. |page=Sense 3(b) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Oxford English Dictionary Online |publisher=Oxford English Dictionary |access-date=2017-01-05|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was popularized and developed by the feminist movement from the 1970s onwards (see § Feminism theory and gender studies below), which theorizes that human nature is essentially [[epicene]] and social distinctions based on sex are arbitrarily constructed. In this context, matters pertaining to this theoretical process of [[Social construction of gender|social construction]] were labelled matters of ''gender''.

The popular use of ''gender'' simply as an alternative to ''sex'' (as a biological category) is also widespread, although attempts are still made to preserve the distinction. The [[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|American Heritage Dictionary]] (2000) uses the following two sentences to illustrate the difference, noting that the distinction "is useful in principle, but it is by no means widely observed, and considerable variation in usage occurs at all levels."&lt;ref name="difference"&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/59/G0075900.html Usage note: ''Gender'',] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321144225/http://bartleby.com/61/59/G0075900.html |date=21 March 2006 }} ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', Fourth Edition, (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The effectiveness of the medication appears to depend on the sex (not gender) of the patient.&lt;br /&gt;In peasant societies, gender (not sex) roles are likely to be more clearly defined.}}

In the last two decades of the 20th century, the use of ''gender'' in academia has increased greatly, outnumbering uses of ''sex'' in the social sciences. While the spread of the word in science publications can be attributed to the influence of feminism, its use as a synonym for sex is attributed to the failure to grasp the distinction made in feminist theory, and the distinction has sometimes become blurred with the theory itself; [[David Haig]] stated, "Among the reasons that working scientists have given me for choosing gender rather than sex in biological contexts are desires to signal sympathy with feminist goals, to use a more academic term, or to avoid the connotation of copulation."&lt;ref name="haig" /&gt;

In legal cases alleging [[discrimination]], ''sex'' is usually preferred as the determining factor rather than ''gender'' as it refers to biology rather than socially constructed [[norm (sociology)|norms]] which are more open to interpretation and dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Render, Meredith. (2006) "Misogyny, Androgyny, and Sexual Harassment: Sex Discrimination in a Gender-Deconstructed World". ''Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Gender''. Vol. 29(1) (Winter). pp. 99–150.&lt;/ref&gt; Julie Greenberg writes that although gender and sex are separate concepts, they are interlinked in that [[gender discrimination]] often results from stereotypes based on what is expected of members of each sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenberg | first1 = Julie A | year = 1999 | title = Defining Male and Female: Intersexuality and the Collision Between Law and Biology | url = | journal = Arizona Law Review | volume = 41 | issue = | page = 265 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B.]]'', United States Supreme Court Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] wrote:

{{quote|The word ‘gender’ has acquired the new and useful connotation of cultural or attitudinal characteristics (as opposed to physical characteristics) distinctive to the sexes.

== Gender identity and gender roles ==
{{Main|Gender identity|Gender role}}

[[File:Sebastian Berggren 1999 for Wild Side Story.jpg|thumb|upright|Gender depicted as an ambiguous phenomenon, by a young Swedish actor]]
''Gender identity'' refers to a personal identification with a particular gender and gender role in society. The term ''[[woman]]'' has historically been used interchangeably with reference to the female body, though more recently this usage has been viewed as controversial by some [[feminist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Mikkola, Mari (12 May 2008). [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2012/entries/feminism-gender "Feminist Perspectives on Sex and Gender."] Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;There are qualitative analyses that explore and present the representations of gender; however, [[feminist]]s challenge these dominant ideologies concerning gender roles and biological sex. One's biological sex is directly tied to specific social roles and the expectations. [[Judith Butler]] considers the concept of being a woman to have more challenges, owing not only to society's viewing women as a social category but also as a felt sense of self, a culturally conditioned or constructed subjective identity.&lt;ref name="Butler 1990"&gt;Butler (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Social identity'' refers to the common identification with a collectivity or social category that creates a common culture among participants concerned.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, D.A. and Oliver, P.E.

The groups people belong to therefore provide members with the definition of who they are and how they should behave within their social sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1996|title=Group norms and the attitude-behavior relationship: A role for group identification|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=22|issue=8|pages=776–793|doi=10.1177/0146167296228002|author1=Terry, D.J.|author2=Hogg, M.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Categorizing males and females into [[social role]]s creates a problem, because individuals feel they have to be at one end of a linear spectrum and must identify themselves as man or woman, rather than being allowed to choose a section in between.&lt;ref&gt;Pathak, Sunita, and Pathak, Surendra [https://www.academia.edu/263120/Gender_and_the_MDGs_with_reference_to_women_as_human "Gender and the MDGs with Reference to Women as Human"]. Academia.edu.&lt;/ref&gt;  Globally, communities interpret biological differences between men and women to create a set of social expectations that define the behaviors that are "appropriate" for men and women and determine women's and men's different access to rights, resources, power in society and health behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Johnson|first2=J.

Pine Forge Press. 3rd edition&lt;/ref&gt; Social roles of men and women in relation to each other is based on the cultural norms of that society, which lead to the creation of [[gender systems]]. The gender system is the basis of social patterns in many societies, which include the separation of sexes, and the primacy of masculine norms.&lt;ref name="Warnecke, Tonia 2013" /&gt;

Philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] said that as sexual subjects, humans are the object of power, which is not an institution or structure, rather it is a signifier or name attributed to "complex strategical situation".&lt;ref&gt;Tong, Rosemarie (2009). Feminist thought : a more comprehensive introduction / Rosemarie Tong.Boulder, Colo.: Westview Press {{ISBN|0-8133-4375-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, "power" is what determines individual attributes, behaviors, etc. and people are a part of an ontologically and epistemologically constructed set of names and labels. For example, being female characterizes one as a woman, and being a woman signifies one as weak, emotional, and irrational, and incapable of actions attributed to a "man". Butler said that gender and sex are more like verbs than nouns. She reasoned that her actions are limited because she is female. "I am not permitted to construct my gender and sex willy-nilly," she said.&lt;ref name="Butler 1990" /&gt; "[This] is so because gender is politically and therefore socially controlled. Rather than 'woman' being something one is, it is something one does."&lt;ref name="Butler 1990" /&gt; More recent criticisms of Judith Butler's theories critique her writing for reinforcing the very conventional dichotomies of gender.&lt;ref&gt;Vigo, Julian.

=== Social assignment and gender fluidity ===
{{See also|Sex assignment}}
According to [[gender studies|gender theorist]] [[Kate Bornstein]], gender can have ambiguity and fluidity.&lt;ref&gt;Bornstein, Kate (1995). ''Gender Outlaw – On Men, Women and the rest of us'', Vintage, {{ISBN|0-679-75701-5}} pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt; There are two contrasting ideas regarding the definition of gender, and the intersection of both of them is definable as below:

The [[World Health Organization]] defines gender as the result of socially constructed ideas about the behavior, actions, and roles a particular sex performs.&lt;ref name="www.who.int" /&gt; The beliefs, values and attitude taken up and exhibited by them is as per the agreeable norms of the society and the personal opinions of the person is not taken into the primary consideration of assignment of gender and imposition of gender roles as per the assigned gender.&lt;ref name="www.who.int" /&gt; Intersections and crossing of the prescribed boundaries have no place in the arena of the social construct of the term "gender".

The assignment of gender involves taking into account the physiological and biological attributes assigned by nature followed by the imposition of the socially constructed conduct. ''Gender'' is a term used to exemplify the attributes that a society or culture constitutes as "masculine" or "feminine". Although a person's sex as male or female stands as a biological fact that is identical in any culture, what that specific sex means in reference to a person's gender role as a woman or a man in society varies cross culturally according to what things are considered to be masculine or feminine.&lt;ref name="Birke, Lynda 2001"&gt;Birke, Lynda. "Chapter 24, In Pursuit of Difference." The Gender and Science Reader. New York: Routledge, 2001. 309-22. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; These roles are learned from various, intersecting sources such as parental influences, the socialization a child receives in school, and what is portrayed in the local media. Learning gender roles starts from birth and includes seemingly simple things like what color outfits a baby is clothed in or what toys they are given to play with. However, a person's gender does not always align with what has been assigned at birth. Factors other than learned behaviors play a role in the development of gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ehrensaft|first=Diane|date=25 May 2017|title=Gender nonconforming youth: current perspectives|journal=Adolescent Health, Medicine and Therapeutics|language=English|volume= 8|pages=57–67|doi=10.2147/ahmt.s110859|issn=1179-318X|pmc=5448699|pmid=28579848}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cultural traits typically coupled to a particular sex finalize the assignment of gender and the biological differences which play a role in classifying either sex as interchangeable with the definition of gender within the social context.

In this context, the socially constructed rules are at a cross road with the assignment of a particular gender to a person. Gender ambiguity deals with having the freedom to choose, manipulate and create a personal niche within any defined socially constructed code of conduct while gender fluidity is outlawing all the rules of cultural gender assignment. It does not accept the prevalence of the two rigidly defined genders "man" and "woman" and believes in freedom to choose any kind of gender with no rules, no defined boundaries and no fulfilling of expectations associated with any particular gender.

Both these definitions are facing opposite directions with their own defined set of rules and criteria on which the said systems are based.

Sexologist John Money [[Neologism|coined the term]] ''gender role'' in 1955. The term ''[[gender role]]'' is defined as the actions or responses that may reveal their status as boy, man, girl or woman, respectively.&lt;ref name="j1"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1955|title=Hermaphroditism, gender and precocity in hyperadrenocorticism: Psychologic findings|journal=Bulletin of the Johns Hopkins Hospital|volume=96|issue=6|pages=253–264|pmid=14378807|last1=Money|first1=J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elements surrounding gender roles include clothing, speech patterns, movement, occupations, and other factors not limited to biological sex. In contrast to taxonomic approaches, some feminist philosophers have argued that gender "is a vast orchestration of subtle mediations between oneself and others", rather than a "private cause behind manifest behaviours".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Laurie|first=Timothy|title=The Ethics of Nobody I Know: Gender and the Politics of Description|url=https://www.academia.edu/6262250|year=2014|journal=Qualitative Research Journal|volume=14|issue=1|pages=64–78|doi=10.1108/qrj-03-2014-0011|hdl=10453/44221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because social aspects of gender can normally be presumed to be the ones of interest in sociology and closely related disciplines, ''gender role'' is often abbreviated to ''gender'' in their literature.

==== Non-binary and third genders ====
{{main|Genderqueer|Third gender}}
Traditionally, most societies have only recognized two distinct, broad classes of gender roles, masculine and feminine, that correspond with the biological sexes of male and female. When a baby is born, society allocates the child to one gender or the other, on the basis of what their genitals resemble.&lt;ref name="Birke, Lynda 2001" /&gt; However, some societies explicitly incorporate people who adopt the gender role opposite to their biological sex; for example, the [[two-spirit]] people of some indigenous American peoples. Other societies include well-developed roles that are explicitly considered more or less distinct from archetypal female and male roles in those societies. In the language of the [[sociology of gender]], they comprise a [[third gender]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | editor=Gilbert Herdt | title=Third Sex Third Gender: Beyond Sexual Dimorphism in Culture and History | year=1996 | isbn=978-0-942299-82-3 | oclc=35293440}}&lt;/ref&gt; more or less distinct from biological sex (sometimes the basis for the role does include intersexuality or incorporates [[eunuch]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Will Roscoe, ''Changing Ones: Third and Fourth Genders in Native North America'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2000. {{ISBN|0-312-22479-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these traditionally recognized third genders, many cultures now recognize, to differing degrees, various [[genderqueer|non-binary gender identities]]. People who are non-binary (or genderqueer) have gender identities that are not exclusively masculine or feminine. They may identify as having an overlap of gender identities, having two or more genders, having no gender, having a fluctuating gender identity, or being third gender or other-gendered. Recognition of non-binary genders is still somewhat new to mainstream Western culture,&lt;ref&gt;McGee, R. Jon and Richard L. Warms (2011). Anthropological Theory: An Introductory History. New York, McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; and non-binary people may face increased risk of assault, harassment, and discrimination.&lt;ref name="Harrison2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jack Harrison |author2=Jaime Grant |author3=Jody L.

[[Joan Roughgarden]] argues that some non-human animal species also have more than two genders, in that there might be multiple templates for behavior available to individual organisms with a given biological sex.&lt;ref&gt;Roughgarden, Joan (2004) ''Evolution's Rainbow: Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People''.

=== Measurement of gender identity ===
Early gender identity research hypothesized a single bipolar dimension of masculinity-femininity, with masculinity and femininity being opposites on one continuum. Assumptions of the unidimensional model were challenged as societal stereotypes changed, which led to the development of a two-dimensional gender identity model. In the model, masculinity and femininity were conceptualized as two separate and orthogonal dimensions, coexisting in varying degrees within an individual. This conceptualization on femininity and masculinity remains the accepted standard today.&lt;ref name=palan /&gt;

Two instruments incorporating the multidimensional nature of masculinity and femininity have dominated gender identity research: The Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) and the [[Personal Attributes Questionnaire]] (PAQ). Both instruments categorize individuals as either being sex typed (males report themselves as identifying primarily with masculine traits, females report themselves as identifying primarily with feminine traits), cross sex-typed (males report themselves as identifying primarily with feminine traits, females report themselves as identifying primarily with masculine traits), androgynous (either males or females who report themselves as high on both masculine and feminine traits) or undifferentiated (either males or females who report themselves as low on both masculine and feminine traits).&lt;ref name=palan&gt;{{cite journal|author=Palan, K. |year=2001 |url=http://www.amsreview.org/articles/palan10-2001.pdf |title=Gender Identity in Consumer Research: A Literature Review and Research Agenda |journal=Academy of Marketing Science Review |volume=10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911204513/http://www.amsreview.org/articles/palan10-2001.pdf |archivedate=11 September 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenge (1997) noted that men are generally more masculine than women and women generally more feminine than men, but the association between biological sex and masculinity/femininity is waning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1997|title=Changes in masculine and feminine traits over time: A meta-analysis|journal=Sex Roles|volume=36|issue=5–6|pages=305–325|doi=10.1007/BF02766650|last1=Twenge|first1=Jean M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feminist theory and gender studies ===
{{Feminist philosophy sidebar}}
Biologist and feminist academic [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]] rejects the discourse of biological versus social determinism and advocates a deeper analysis of how interactions between the biological being and the social environment influence individuals' capacities.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Fausto-Sterling (1992) ''Myths of Gender: Biological Theories about Men and Women''. New York: Basic Books. p. 8 {{ISBN|0-465-04792-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher and feminist [[Simone de Beauvoir]] applied [[existentialism]] to women's experience of life: "One is not born a woman, one becomes one."&lt;ref&gt;de Beauvoir, Simone (1949) ''The Second Sex''."&lt;/ref&gt; In context, this is a philosophical statement. However, it may be analyzed in terms of biology—a girl must pass [[puberty]] to become a woman—and sociology, as a great deal of mature relating in social contexts is learned rather than instinctive.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling (2000) Chapter 3 "Of Gender and Genitals", pp. 44–77&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[feminist theory]], terminology for gender issues developed over the 1970s. In the 1974 edition of ''Masculine/Feminine or Human'', the author uses "innate gender" and "learned sex roles",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Chafetz, J.S. | title=Masculine/Feminine or Human? An Overview of the Sociology of Sex Roles | location=Itasca, Illinois | publisher=F.E. Peacock | year=1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the 1978 edition, the use of ''sex'' and ''gender'' is reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Chafetz, J.S. | title=Masculine/Feminine or Human? An Overview of the Sociology of Sex Roles | location=Itasca, Illinois | publisher=F.E. Peacock | year= 1978 | isbn=978-0-87581-231-1 | oclc=4348310}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1980, most feminist writings had agreed on using ''gender'' only for socioculturally adapted [[trait theory|traits]].

In [[gender studies]] the term ''gender'' refers to proposed social and cultural constructions of masculinities and femininities. In this context, ''gender'' explicitly excludes reference to biological differences, to focus on cultural differences.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett, Stephanie (1992). [https://books.google.com/books?id=WMoNAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Gender''], Routledge p. vii {{ISBN|0-422-60570-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This emerged from a number of different areas: in sociology during the 1950s; from the theories of the psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan#Lacan and his discontents|Jacques Lacan]]; and in the work of French psychoanalysts like [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Luce Irigaray]], and American feminists such as [[Judith Butler]]. Those who followed Butler came to regard gender roles as a practice, sometimes referred to as "[[performative]]".&lt;ref&gt;Butler (1990) p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles E. Hurst states that some people think sex will, "...automatically determine one's gender demeanor and role (social) as well as one's [[sexual orientation]] (sexual attractions and behavior).&lt;ref name="Hurst141" /&gt; Gender sociologists believe that people have [[cultural]] origins and habits for dealing with gender. For example, Michael Schwalbe believes that humans must be taught how to act appropriately in their designated gender to fill the role properly, and that the way people behave as masculine or feminine interacts with social expectations. Schwalbe comments that humans "are the results of many people embracing and acting on similar ideas".&lt;ref&gt;Schwalbe, M. (2005). The Sociologically Examined Life: Pieces of the Conversation Third Edition.  pp. 22–23 {{ISBN|0-07-282579-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; People do this through everything from [[clothing]] and hairstyle to relationship and employment choices. Schwalbe believes that these distinctions are important, because society wants to identify and categorize people as soon as we see them. They need to place people into distinct categories to know how we should feel about them.

Hurst comments that in a society where we present our genders so distinctly, there can often be severe consequences for breaking these cultural norms. Many of these consequences are rooted in [[discrimination]] based on sexual orientation. Gays and lesbians are often discriminated against in our legal system because of societal prejudices.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, N. and Stanley, E. (2011). Captive Genders. 1st ed. Edinburgh: AK Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Center for American Progress, (2016). Unjust: How The Broken Criminal Justice System Fails LGBT People. Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lydon et al., "Coming Out of Concrete Closets: A Report on Black &amp; Pink's National LGBTQ Prisoner Survey."&lt;/ref&gt;  Hurst describes how this discrimination works against people for breaking gender norms, no matter what their sexual orientation is. He says that "courts often confuse sex, gender, and sexual orientation, and confuse them in a way that results in denying the rights not only of gays and lesbians, but also of those who do not present themselves or act in a manner traditionally expected of their sex".&lt;ref name="Hurst141"&gt;Hurst, C. (2007) ''Social Inequality: Forms, Causes, and Consequences''. 6th Edition. pp. 131, 139–142&lt;/ref&gt; This prejudice plays out in our legal system when a person is judged differently because they do not present themselves as the "correct" gender.

[[Andrea Dworkin]] stated her "commitment to destroying male dominance and gender itself" while stating her belief in [[radical feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Andrea (1995). "My Life as a Writer", pp.&amp;nbsp;33–34 in Dworkin, Andrea ''Life and Death: Unapologetic Writings on the Continuing War Against Women''. New York: Free Press. {{ISBN|0-7432-3626-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientist [[Mary Hawkesworth]] addresses gender and feminist theory, stating that since the 1970s the concept of gender has transformed and been used in significantly different ways within feminist scholarship. She notes that a transition occurred when several feminist scholars, such as [[Sandra Harding]] and [[Joan Wallach Scott|Joan Scott]], began to conceive of gender "as an analytic category within which humans think about and organize their social activity". Feminist scholars in [[Political Science]] began employing gender as an analytical category, which highlighted "social and political relations neglected by mainstream accounts". However, Hawkesworth states "feminist political science has not become a dominant paradigm within the discipline".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hawkesworth|first=Mary|year=2005|title=Engendering political science: An immodest proposal|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|volume=1|issue=1|pages=141–156|doi=10.1017/s1743923x0523101x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American political scientist Karen Beckwith addresses the concept of gender within political science arguing that a "common language of gender" exists and that it must be explicitly articulated in order to build upon it within the political science discipline. Beckwith describes two ways in which the political scientist may employ 'gender' when conducting empirical research: "gender as a category and as a process." Employing gender as a category allows for political scientists "to delineate specific contexts where behaviours, actions, attitudes and preferences considered masculine or feminine result in particular" political outcomes. It may also demonstrate how gender differences, not necessarily corresponding precisely with sex, may "constrain or facilitate political" actors. Gender as a process has two central manifestations in political science research, firstly in determining "the differential effects of structures and policies upon men and women," and secondly, the ways in which masculine and feminine political actors "actively work to produce favorable gendered outcomes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karen|first=Beckwith|title=A Common Language of Gender?|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|year=2005|volume=1|issue=1|page=132|doi=10.1017/s1743923x05211017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to gender studies, Jacquetta Newman states that although sex is determined biologically, the ways in which people express gender is not. Gendering is a socially constructed process based on culture, though often cultural expectations around women and men have a direct relationship to their biology.  Because of this, Newman argues, many privilege sex as being a cause of oppression and ignore other issues like race, ability, poverty, etc. Current gender studies classes seek to move away from that and examine the intersectionality of these factors in determining people's lives. She also points out that other non-Western cultures do not necessarily have the same views of gender and gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women, Politics, and Public Policy: The Political Struggles of Canadian Women, 2nd ed|last=White|first=Linda|publisher=Oxford Press|year=1964|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newman also debates the meaning of equality, which is often considered the goal of feminism; she believes that ''equality'' is a problematic term because it can mean many different things, such as people being treated identically, differently, or fairly based on their gender. Newman believes this is problematic because there is no unified definition as to what equality means or looks like, and that this can be significantly important in areas like public policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women, Politics, and Public Policy: The Political Struggles of Canadian Women, 2nd ed|last=White|first=Linda|publisher=Oxford Press|year=1964|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social construction of sex hypotheses ===
{{See also|Sex and gender distinction}}
[[File:WomanFactory1940s.jpg|thumb|"[[Rosie the Riveter]]" was an iconic symbol of the American [[Home front during World War II|homefront]] in [[World War II|WWII]] and a departure from [[gender role]]s due to [[Total war|wartime necessity]].]]
Sociologists generally regard gender as a social construct, and various researchers, including many [[Feminism|feminists]], consider sex to only be a matter of biology and something that is not about social or cultural construction. For instance, [[Sexology|sexologist]] [[John Money]] suggests the distinction between biological sex and gender as a role.&lt;ref name=j1 /&gt; Moreover, [[Ann Oakley]], a professor of sociology and social policy, says "the constancy of sex must be admitted, but so also must the variability of gender."&lt;ref&gt;Oakley, Ann (1972). ''Sex, Gender and Society''. London: Temple Smith. p. 16 {{ISBN|0-85117-020-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] states, "'[s]ex' refers to the biological and physiological characteristics that define men and women," and "'gender' refers to the socially constructed roles, behaviours, activities, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women."&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization (2002). "[http://www.who.int/gender/whatisgender/en/ Gender and Reproductive Rights: Working Definitions]". Retrieved 15 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, sex is regarded as a category studied in biology (natural sciences), while gender is studied in [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]]. Lynda Birke, a feminist biologist, maintains "'biology' is not seen as something which might change."&lt;ref&gt;Birke, Lynda (2001). "In Pursuit of Difference: Scientific Studies of Women and Men," Muriel Lederman and Ingrid Bartsch eds., ''The Gender and Science Reader'', New York: Routledge. p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is stated that sex is something that does not change, while gender can change according to social structure.

However, there are scholars who argue that sex is also socially constructed. For example, gender theorist [[Judith Butler]] states that "perhaps this construct called 'sex' is as culturally constructed as gender; indeed, perhaps it was always already gender, with the consequence that the distinction between sex and gender turns out to be no distinction at all."&lt;ref&gt;Butler (1990) p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
She continues:&lt;blockquote&gt;It would make no sense, then, to define gender as the cultural interpretation of sex, if sex is itself a gender-centered category. Gender should not be conceived merely as the cultural inscription of meaning based on a given sex (a juridical conception); gender must also designate the very apparatus of production whereby the sexes themselves are established. [...] This production of sex as the pre-discursive should be understood as the effect of the apparatus of cultural construction designated by gender.&lt;ref&gt;Butler (1990) p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Butler argues that "bodies only appear, only endure, only live within the productive constraints of certain highly gendered regulatory schemas,"&lt;ref&gt;Butler (1993) p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; and sex is "no longer as a bodily given on which the construct of gender is artificially imposed, but as a cultural norm which governs the materialization of bodies."&lt;ref&gt;Butler (1993) pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Marria Lugones states that, among the [[Yoruba people]], there was no concept of gender and no gender system at all before [[colonialism]]. She argues that colonial powers used a gender system as a tool for domination and fundamentally changing social relations among the indigenous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lugones|first=María|date=Winter 2008|title=Heterosexualism and the Colonial/Modern Gender System|journal=Hypatia|volume=22|issue=1|pages=196–198|doi=10.1353/hyp.2006.0067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to history, Linda Nicholson, a professor of history and [[women's studies]], points out that the understanding of human bodies as sexually dimorphic was historically not recognised. She argues that male and female genitals were considered inherently the same in Western society until the 18th century. At that time, female genitals were regarded as incomplete male genitals, and the difference between the two was conceived as a matter of degree. In other words, there was a belief in a gradation of physical forms, or a spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1994 |title="Interpreting Gender". Signs |journal=Journal of Women in Culture and Society |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=79–105 |doi=10.1086/494955 |jstor=3174928 |author=Nicholson, Linda }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, drawing from the empirical research of [[intersex]] children, [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]], a professor of biology and [[gender studies]], describes how the doctors address the issues of intersexuality. She starts her argument with an example of the birth of an intersexual individual and maintains "our conceptions of the nature of gender difference shape, even as they reflect, the ways we structure our social system and polity; they also shape and reflect our understanding of our physical bodies."&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling (2000) p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Then she adds how gender assumptions affects the scientific study of sex by presenting the research of intersexuals by John Money et al., and she concludes that "they never questioned the fundamental assumption that there are only two sexes, because their goal in studying intersexuals was to find out more about 'normal' development."&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling (2000) p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; She also mentions the language the doctors use when they talk with the parents of the intersexuals. After describing how the doctors inform parents about the intersexuality, she asserts that because the doctors believe that the intersexuals are actually male or female, they tell the parents of the intersexuals that it will take a little bit more time for the doctors to determine whether the infant is a boy or a girl. That is to say, the doctors' behavior is formulated by the cultural gender assumption that there are only two sexes. Lastly, she maintains that the differences in the ways in which the medical professionals in different regions treat intersexual people also give us a good example of how sex is socially constructed.&lt;ref name="Fausto-Sterling, Anne 2000"&gt;Fausto-Sterling (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; In her ''Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction of sexuality'', she introduces the following example:&lt;blockquote&gt; A group of physicians from Saudi Arabia recently reported on several cases of XX intersex children with [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH), a genetically inherited malfunction of the [[enzyme]]s that aid in making [[steroid hormones]]. [...] In the United States and Europe, such children, because they have the potential to bear children later in life, are usually raised as girls. Saudi doctors trained in this European tradition recommended such a course of action to the Saudi parents of CAH XX children. A number of parents, however, refused to accept the recommendation that their child, initially identified as a son, be raised instead as a daughter. Nor would they accept feminizing surgery for their child. [...] This was essentially an expression of local community attitudes with [...] the preference for male offspring.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling (2000) pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus it is evident that culture can play a part in assigning gender, particularly in relation to intersex children.&lt;ref name="Fausto-Sterling, Anne 2000" /&gt;

Another work of Ann Fausto-Sterling's in which she discusses gender is ''The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female Are Not Enough.'' In this article, Fausto-Sterling states that Western culture has only two sexes and that even their language restricts the presence of more than two sexes. She argues that instead of having a binomial nomenclature for organizing humans into two distinct sexes (male and female), there are at least five sexes in the broad spectrum of gender. These five sexes include male, female, hermaphrodite, female [[pseudohermaphrodites]] (individuals who have ovaries and some male genitalia but lack testes), and male pseudohermaphrodites (individuals who have testes and some female genitalia but lack ovaries). Fausto-Sterling additionally adds that in the category of hermaphrodites, there are additional degrees and levels in which the genitalia are developed; this means that there may be more intersexes that exist in this continuum of gender.

Fausto-Sterling argues that gender has been gradually institutionally disciplined into a binary system through medical advances. She brings up multiple instances where gender in history was not split into strictly male or female, and states that, by the end of the Middle Age, intersex individuals were forced to pick a side in the binary gender code and to adhere by it. She adds on that "hermaphrodites have unruly bodies" and they need to fit into society's definition of gender.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ridgeway|first1=Cecilia L.|last2=Correll|first2=Shelley J.|title=Unpacking the Gender System: A Theoretical Perspective on Gender Beliefs and Social Relations|jstor=4149448|volume=18|issue=4|pages=510–531|doi=10.1177/0891243204265269|journal=Gender|year=2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, modern-day parents have been urged by medical doctors to decide the sex for their hermaphroditic child immediately after childbirth. She emphasizes that the role of the medical community is that of an institutionalized discipline on society that there can only be two sexes: male and female and only the two listed are considered "normal." Lastly, Fausto-Sterling argues that modern laws require humans to be labelled either as male or female and that "ironically, a more sophisticated knowledge of the complexity of sexual systems has led to the repression of such intricacy."&lt;ref name="jstor.org" /&gt; She mentions this quote to inform the prevailing thought that hermaphrodites, without medical intervention, are assumed to live a life full of psychological pain when in fact, there is no evidence in which that is the case. She finishes up her argument asking what would happen if society started accepting intersex individuals.

The article ''Adolescent Gender-Role Identity and Mental Health: Gender Intensification Revisited'' focuses on the work of Heather A. Priess, Sara M. Lindberg, and [[Janet Shibley Hyde]] on whether or not girls and boys diverge in their gender identities during adolescent years. The researchers based their work on ideas previously mentioned by Hill and Lynch in their gender intensification hypothesis in that signals and messages from parents determine and affect their children's [[gender role]] identities. This hypothesis argues that parents affect their children's gender role identities and that different interactions spent with either parents will affect gender intensification. Priess and among other's study did not support the hypothesis of Hill and Lynch which stated "that as adolescents experience these and other socializing influences, they will become more stereotypical in their gender-role identities and gendered attitudes and behaviors."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Priess|first1=Heather A.|last2=Lindberg|first2=Sara M.|last3=Hyde|first3=Janet Shibley|title=Adolescent Gender-Role Identity and Mental Health: Gender Intensification Revisited|jstor=25592088|volume=80|issue=5|pages=1531–1544|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2009.01349.x|journal=Child Development|pmc=4244905|pmid=19765016|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the researchers did state that perhaps the hypothesis Hill and Lynch proposed was true in the past but is not true now due to changes in the population of teens in respect to their gender-role identities.

Authors of ''Unpacking the Gender System: A Theoretical Perspective on Gender Belief’s and Social Relations'', Cecilia Ridgeway and Shelley Correll, argue that gender is more than an identity or role but is something that is institutionalized through "social relational contexts." Ridgeway and Correll define "social relational contexts" as "any situation in which individuals define themselves in relation to others in order to act."&lt;ref name="Wiley"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ridgeway|first1=Cecilia L.|last2=Correll|first2=Shelley J.|title=Unpacking the Gender System: A Theoretical Perspective on Gender Beliefs and Social Relations|jstor=4149448|volume=18|issue=4|pages=510–531|doi=10.1177/0891243204265269|journal=Gender|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also point out that in addition to social relational contexts, cultural beliefs plays a role in the gender system. The coauthors argue that daily people are forced to acknowledge and interact with others in ways that are related to gender. Every day, individuals are interacting with each other and comply with society's set standard of [[hegemonic]] beliefs, which includes gender roles. They state that society's hegemonic cultural beliefs sets the rules which in turn create the setting for which social relational contexts are to take place. Ridgeway and Correll then shift their topic towards sex categorization. The authors define sex categorization as "the sociocognitive process by which we label another as male or female."&lt;ref name="Wiley" /&gt;

In most cases, men and women and boys and girls are similar in behavior, with little gender difference, but some gendered behavior is influenced by prenatal and early life androgen exposure.

The [[sexual dimorphism#Psychological and behavioral differentiation|biology of gender]] became the subject of an expanding number of studies over the course of the late 20th century. One of the earliest areas of interest was what became known as "gender identity disorder" (GID) and which is now also described as [[gender dysphoria]]. Studies in this, and related areas, inform the following summary of the subject by John Money. He stated:

{{quote|The term "gender role" appeared in print first in 1955. The term ''gender identity'' was used in a press release, November 21, 1966, to announce the new clinic for transsexuals at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. It was disseminated in the media worldwide, and soon entered the vernacular. The definitions of gender and gender identity vary on a doctrinal basis. In popularized and scientifically debased usage, sex is what you are biologically; gender is what you become socially; gender identity is your own sense or conviction of maleness or femaleness; and gender role is the cultural stereotype of what is masculine and feminine. Causality with respect to gender identity disorder is sub-divisible into genetic, prenatal hormonal, postnatal social, and post-pubertal hormonal determinants, but there is, as yet, no comprehensive and detailed theory of causality. Gender coding in the brain is bipolar. In gender identity disorder, there is discordance between the natal sex of one's external genitalia and the brain coding of one's gender as masculine or feminine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=7996589|year=1994|last1=Money|first1=J|title=The concept of gender identity disorder in childhood and adolescence after 39 years|volume=20|issue= 3|pages=163–177|doi= 10.1080/00926239408403428|journal= Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Money refers to attempts to distinguish a difference between biological sex and social gender as "scientifically debased", because of our increased knowledge of a continuum of [[sexual dimorphism|dimorphic]] features (Money's word is "dipolar") that link biological and behavioral differences. These extend from the exclusively biological "genetic" and "prenatal hormonal" differences between men and women, to "postnatal" features, some of which are social, but others have been shown to result from "post-pubertal hormonal" effects.

Although causation from the biological—[[Genetics|genetic]] and [[Sex steroids|hormonal]]—to the behavioral has been broadly demonstrated and accepted, Money is careful to also note that understanding of the causal chains from biology to behavior in sex and gender issues is very far from complete. For example, the existence of a "[[Biology and sexual orientation|gay gene]]" has not been proven, but such a gene remains an acknowledged possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= Michael | last= Abrams | url= http://discovermagazine.com/2007/jun/born-gay/article_view?b_start:int=0&amp;-C= | title= The Real Story on Gay Genes: Homing in on the science of homosexuality—and sexuality itself| work= [[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]  | date= June 2007 | publisher= | accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are studies concerning women who have a condition called [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]], which leads to the overproduction of the masculine sex [[hormone]], [[androgen]]. These women usually have ordinary female appearances (though nearly all girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) have corrective surgery performed on their genitals). However, despite taking hormone-balancing medication given to them at birth, these females are statistically more likely to be interested in activities traditionally linked to males than female activities. Psychology professor and CAH researcher Dr. Sheri Berenbaum attributes these differences to an exposure of higher levels of male sex hormones in utero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Beattie-Moss | first = Melissa | authorlink =  | title = Are gender differences predetermined? | website =  | publisher = [[Penn State University]] | date = 8 June 2005 | url = http://www.rps.psu.edu/probing/gender.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060113080145/http://www.rps.psu.edu/probing/gender.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 13 January 2006 | doi =  | accessdate = 30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender taxonomy ===
The following [[gender taxonomy]] illustrates the kinds of diversity that have been studied and reported in medical literature. It is placed in roughly chronological order of biological and social development in the human [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]. The earlier stages are more purely biological and the latter are more dominantly social. Causation is known to operate from chromosome to gonads, and from gonads to hormones. It is also significant from brain structure to gender identity (see Money quote above). Brain structure and processing (biological) that may explain erotic preference (social), however, is an area of ongoing research. Terminology in some areas changes quite rapidly as knowledge grows.
* [[chromosome]]s: 46,XX ([[Female|genetic female]]); 46,XY ([[Male|genetic male]]) ;45,X ([[Turner's syndrome]]); 47,XXY ([[Klinefelter syndrome]]); 47,XYY ([[XYY syndrome]]); 47,XXX ([[XXX syndrome]]); 48,XXYY ([[XXYY syndrome]]); 46,XX/XY [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaic]]; other mosaic;
* [[gonad]]s: [[testicle]]s; [[ovary|ovaries]]; ovarian and testicular tissues, not in same gonad ([[true hermaphroditism]]), [[Ovotestis|ovotestes]], or other [[gonadal dysgenesis]];
* [[hormone]]s: [[androgen]]s (including [[testosterone]], [[dihydrotestosterone]], etc.), [[estrogen]]s (including [[estradiol]], [[estriol]], etc.), [[antiandrogen]]s, [[progestogen]]s, and [[List of human hormones|others]];
* [[Sex organ|primary sexual characteristics]]: [[Sex organ#External and internal organs|genitals]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.dsdguidelines.org/htdocs/parents/handout_genital_development.html | title= Genital Development| work= Handbook for Parents| via= dsdguidelines.org | publisher= Consortium on the Management of Disorders of Sex Development; Intersex Society of America| year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Secondary sex characteristic#In humans|secondary sexual characteristics]]: dimorphic physical characteristics, other than primary characteristics (such as [[Androgenic hair|body hair]], development of [[breast]]s); certain changes in brain structure due to organizing effects of sex hormones&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= Is it useful to view the brain as a secondary sexual characteristic?| journal= Neurosci Biobehav Rev. |volume = 46 Pt 4| date= October 2014| number= 46 Pt 4| pages= 628–38 | doi= 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.08.009| last1= Ball | first1= GF | last2= Balthazart | first2= J | last3= McCarthy | first3= MM | pmid= 25195165}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[gender identity]]: one’s sense of oneself as a [[man]], [[woman]], or [[Gender variance|gender non-conforming]];
* [[gender expression]]: presentation and behaviors that express aspects of gender identity or [[gender role]]

=== Sexual dimorphism ===

[[File:Peacock courting peahen.jpg|thumb|Sexual differentiation in [[peafowl]]]]
Although sexual reproduction is ''defined'' at the cellular level, key features of sexual reproduction operate ''within'' the structures of the gamete cells themselves. Notably, gametes carry very long molecules called [[DNA]] that the biological processes of reproduction can "read" like a book of instructions. In fact, there are typically many of these "books", called ''chromosomes''. Human gametes usually have 23 chromosomes, 22 of which are common to both sexes. The final chromosomes in the two human gametes are called ''sex'' chromosomes because of their role in [[Sex-determination systems|sex determination]]. [[Ovum|Ova]] always have the same sex chromosome, labelled ''[[X chromosome|X]]''. About half of [[spermatozoa]] also have this same X chromosome, the rest have a [[Y chromosome|Y-chromosome]]. At fertilization the gametes fuse to form a cell, usually with 46 chromosomes, and either XX female or XY male, depending on whether the sperm carried an X or a Y chromosome. Some of the other possibilities are listed [[Gender#Gender taxonomy|above]].

Genes which are specific to the X or Y chromosome are called [[sex-linked genes]]. For example, the genes which create red and green retinal photoreceptors are located on the X chromosome, which men only have one of. Thus [[red-green color blindness]] is an [[X-linked recessive inheritance|X-linked recessive trait]] and is much more common in men. However, [[sex-limited genes]] on any chromosome can be expressed to indicate, for example, "if in a male body, do X; otherwise, do not."

The human [[XY sex-determination system|XY system]] is not the only sex determination system. Birds typically have a reverse, ZW system—males are ZZ and females ZW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first1= Maria | last1= Lepowsky | first2= JS | last2= Chafetz | title= The Encyclopedic Entry of Gender | via = Reference.com; Dictionary.com| year= 2008| publisher=  | isbn= }}{{nonspecific| date= February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether male or female birds influence the sex of offspring is not known for all species. Several species of [[butterfly]] are known to have female parent sex determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2= Sahara|first2=K.|last3=Marec|first3=F.|year= 2007|title=Sex Chromosomes and Sex Determination in Lepidoptera|journal=Sexual Development|volume=1|issue=6|pages=332–46|doi=10.1159/000111765|pmid=18391545|quote=The speciose insect order Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) and their closest relatives, Trichoptera (caddis flies), share a female-heterogametic sex chromosome system|last1=Traut|first1=W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, what is functionally relevant are differences in composition and "wiring". [[Richard J. Haier]] and colleagues at the universities of [[University of New Mexico|New Mexico]] and [[University of California, Irvine|California (Irvine)]] found, using [[brain mapping]], that men have more [[grey matter]] related to general [[intelligence]] than women, and women have more [[white matter]] related to intelligence than men – the ratio between grey and white matter is 4% higher for men than women.&lt;ref name="Haier" /&gt;

Grey matter is used for information processing, while white matter consists of the connections between processing centers. Other differences are measurable but less pronounced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tamminga, Carol A. |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/156/3/352 |title=Brain Development, XI: Sexual Dimorphism|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=156|year=1999|pages= 352|pmid=10080547|last2=Kennedy|first2=DN|last3=Caviness Jr|first3=VS|issue=3|doi=10.1176/ajp.156.3.352|doi-broken-date=2019-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of these differences are produced by hormonal activity, ultimately derived from the Y chromosome and sexual differentiation. However, differences that arise directly from gene activity have also been observed.

It has also been demonstrated that brain processing responds to the external environment. Learning, both of ideas and behaviors, appears to be coded in brain processes. It also appears that in several simplified cases this coding operates differently, but in some ways equivalently, in the brains of men and women.&lt;ref&gt;"Even when men and women do the same chores equally well, they may use different brain circuits to get the same result." Linda Marsha (July 2007). [http://discovermagazine.com/2007/brain/she-thinks 'He Thinks, She Thinks',] ''[[Discover (magazine)]]''&lt;/ref&gt; For example, both men and women learn and use language; however, [[Biochemistry|bio-chemically]], they appear to process it differently. Differences in female and male use of language are likely reflections ''both'' of biological preferences and aptitudes, ''and'' of learned patterns.

== Gender studies ==
{{Main|Gender studies}}
[[Gender studies]] is a [[Field of study|field]] of [[interdisciplinary]] study and [[List of academic disciplines|academic field]] devoted to gender, [[gender identity]] and gendered [[Representation (politics)|representation]] as central categories of analysis. This field includes [[Women's studies]] (concerning [[women]], [[feminity]], their [[gender role]]s and politics, and [[feminism]]), [[Men's studies]] (concerning [[men]], [[masculinity]], their [[gender role]]s, and politics), and [[LGBT studies]].&lt;ref name="whitman"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whitman.edu/content/genderstudies | archive-url=https://archive.is/20121212181127/http://www.whitman.edu/content/genderstudies | dead-url=yes | archive-date=12 December 2012 | title=Gender Studies | publisher=Whitman College | accessdate=2 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sometimes Gender studies is offered together with Study of [[Human sexuality|Sexuality]].

== Psychology and sociology ==
{{See also|Sex and psychology}}
Many of the more complicated human behaviors are influenced by both innate factors and by environmental ones, which include everything from genes, gene expression, and body chemistry, through diet and social pressures. A large area of research in [[behavioralism|behavioral psychology]] collates evidence in an effort to discover [[correlation]]s between behavior and various possible antecedents such as genetics, gene regulation, access to food and vitamins, culture, gender, hormones, physical and social development, and physical and social environments.

A core research area within sociology is the way human behavior operates on ''itself'', in other words, how the behavior of one group or individual influences the behavior of other groups or individuals. Starting in the late 20th century, the feminist movement has contributed extensive study of gender and theories about it, notably within sociology but not restricted to it.

Social theorists have sought to determine the specific nature of gender in relation to biological sex and sexuality,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} with the result being that culturally established gender and sex have become interchangeable identifications that signify the allocation of a specific 'biological' sex within a categorical gender.{{Citation needed| date= May 2008}} The second wave feminist view that gender is socially constructed and hegemonic in all societies, remains current in some literary theoretical circles, Kira Hall and Mary Bucholtz publishing new perspectives as recently as 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6d37lDUcLYEC&amp;pg=PP11 |title= Gender Articulated |accessdate= 21 September 2008 |publisher= Routledge |isbn= 978-0-415-91399-7 |year= 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary socialisation theory proposes the notion that when a child is first born it has a biological sex but no social gender.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} As the child grows, "...society provides a string of prescriptions, templates, or models of behaviors appropriate to the one sex or the other,"&lt;ref&gt;Connell, R.

''Gender: The Pain and Pleasure of Difference''. Longman, Melbourne {{ISBN|0-582-86903-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe society is constructed in a way that splits gender into a dichotomy via social organisations that constantly invent and reproduce cultural images of gender. Joan Acker believes gendering occurs in at least five different interacting social processes:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| year= 1990|title= Hierarchies, Jobs, Bodies: A Theory of Gendered Organizations|url=http://www.csun.edu/~snk1966/J.%20Acker%20Hierarchies,%20Jobs,%20Bodies%20--%20A%20Theory%20of%20Gendered%20Organizations.pdf|journal=Gender &amp; Society|volume=4|issue=2|pages=139–158|doi= 10.1177/089124390004002002|jstor=189609|last1=Acker|first1=J.|citeseerx= 10.1.1.693.1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The construction of divisions along the lines of gender, such as those produced by labor, power, family, the state, even allowed behaviors and locations in physical space
* The construction of symbols and images such as language, ideology, dress and the media, that explain, express and reinforce, or sometimes oppose, those divisions
* Interactions between men and women, women and women and men and men that involve any form of dominance and submission. Conversational theorists, for example, have studied the way that interruptions, turn taking and the setting of topics re-create gender inequality in the flow of ordinary talk
* The way that the preceding three processes help to produce gendered components of individual identity, i.e., the way they create and maintain an image of a gendered self
* Gender is implicated in the fundamental, ongoing processes of creating and conceptualising social structures.

Looking at gender through a Foucauldian lens, gender is transfigured into a vehicle for the social division of power. Gender difference is merely a construct of society used to enforce the distinctions made between what is assumed to be female and male, and allow for the domination of masculinity over femininity through the attribution of specific gender-related characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Deji, Olanike F. (2012) ''Gender Concepts and Theories''. Gender and Rural Development. Berlin: Lit. N..&lt;/ref&gt; "The idea that men and women are more different from one another than either is from anything else, must come from something other than nature... far from being an expression of natural differences, exclusive gender identity is the suppression of natural similarities."&lt;ref name=glover&gt;Glover, D and Kaplan, C (2000) [https://books.google.com/books?id=2NLbiutayFoC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Genders''], Routledge, New York {{ISBN|0-415-44243-5}}, p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender conventions play a large role in attributing masculine and feminine characteristics to a fundamental biological sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary| last= Mikkola | first= Mari | title= Feminist Perspectives on Sex and Gender | work= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | edition= Spring 2016 |editor-first= Edward N. | editor-last= Zalta | url= http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/feminism-gender/ | publisher= Stanford University | accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Socio-cultural codes and conventions, the rules by which society functions, and which are both a creation of society as well as a constituting element of it, determine the allocation of these specific traits to the sexes. These traits provide the foundations for the creation of hegemonic gender difference. It follows then, that gender can be assumed as the acquisition and internalisation of social norms. Individuals are therefore socialized through their receipt of society's expectations of 'acceptable' gender attributes that are flaunted within institutions such as the family, the state and the media. Such a notion of 'gender' then becomes naturalized into a person's sense of self or identity, effectively imposing a gendered social category upon a sexed body.&lt;ref name= glover /&gt;

The conception that people are gendered rather than sexed also coincides with Judith Butler's theories of gender performativity. Butler argues that gender is not an expression of what one is, but rather something that one does.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=1999|title=Performativity, Parody, Politics|journal=Theory, Culture &amp; Society|volume=16|issue=2|pages=195–213|doi=10.1177/02632769922050476|last1=Lloyd|first1=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It follows then, that if gender is acted out in a repetitive manner it is in fact re-creating and effectively embedding itself within the social consciousness. Contemporary sociological reference to male and female gender roles typically uses ''masculinities'' and ''femininities'' in the plural rather than singular, suggesting diversity both within cultures as well as across them.

The difference between the sociological and popular definitions of gender involve a different dichotomy and focus. For example, the sociological approach to "gender" (social roles: female versus male) focuses on the difference in (economic/power) position between a male CEO (disregarding the fact that he is [[heterosexual]] or [[Homosexuality|homosexual]]) to female workers in his employ (disregarding whether they are straight or gay). However the popular sexual self-conception approach (self-conception: gay versus straight) focuses on the different self-conceptions and social conceptions of those who are gay/straight, in comparison with those who are straight (disregarding what might be vastly differing economic and power positions between female and male groups in each category). There is then, in relation to definition of and approaches to "gender", a tension between historic feminist sociology and contemporary homosexual sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1994|title=The Heterosexual Imaginary: Feminist Sociology and Theories of Gender|journal=Sociological Theory|volume=12|issue=2|pages=203–219|doi=10.2307/201865|jstor=201865|author=Ingraham, Chrys|citeseerx=10.1.1.470.737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal status ==

A person's sex as male or female has legal significance—sex is indicated on government documents, and laws provide differently for men and women. Many pension systems have different retirement ages for men or women. Marriage is usually only available to opposite-sex couples; in some countries and jurisdictions there are [[same-sex marriage]] laws.

The question then arises as to what legally determines whether someone is female or male. In most cases this can appear obvious, but the matter is complicated for [[intersex]] or [[transgender]] people. Different jurisdictions have adopted different answers to this question. Almost all countries permit changes of legal gender status in cases of intersexualism, when the gender assignment made at birth is determined upon further investigation to be biologically inaccurate—technically, however, this is not a change of status ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]''. Rather, it is recognition of a status deemed to exist but unknown from birth. Increasingly, jurisdictions also provide a procedure for changes of legal gender for transgender people.

[[Sex assignment|Gender assignment]], when there are indications that genital sex might not be decisive in a particular case, is normally not defined by a single definition, but by a combination of conditions, including chromosomes and gonads. Thus, for example, in many jurisdictions a person with XY chromosomes but female [[gonad]]s could be recognized as female at birth.

The ability to [[Legal aspects of transsexualism|change legal gender]] for transgender people in particular has given rise to the phenomena in some jurisdictions of the same person having different genders for the purposes of different areas of the law. For example, in Australia prior to the Re Kevin decisions, transsexual people could be recognized as having the genders they identified with under many areas of the law, including social security law, but not for the law of marriage. Thus, for a period, it was possible for the same person to have two different genders under Australian law.

It is also possible in federal systems for the same person to have one gender under state law and a different gender under federal law.

=== Languages ===
{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Natural languages often make gender distinctions. These may be of various kinds, more or less loosely associated by analogy with various actual or perceived differences between men and women.  Some grammatical gender systems go beyond, or ignore, the masculine-feminine distinction.
&lt;ref&gt;Kroulek, A. (2016, January 18). Why do languages have gender? Retrieved March 12, 2018, from http://www.k-international.com/blog/why-do-languages-have-gender/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many languages include terms that are used asymmetrically in reference to men and women. Concern that current language may be biased in favor of men has led some authors in recent times to argue for the use of a more [[Gender-neutral language in English|gender-neutral vocabulary]] in English and other languages.
* Several languages attest the use of different vocabulary by men and women, to differing degrees. See, for instance, [[Gender differences in spoken Japanese]]. The oldest documented language, [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], records a distinctive sub-language only used by female speakers. Conversely, many [[Indigenous Australian languages]] have distinctive registers with a limited [[lexicon]] used by men in the presence of their mothers-in-law (see [[Avoidance speech]]). As well, quite a few [[sign language]]s have a gendered distinction due to boarding schools segregated by gender, such as [[Irish Sign Language]].
* Several languages such as [[Persian language|Persian]] or [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] are gender-neutral. In Persian the same word is used in reference to men and women. Verbs, adjectives and nouns are not gendered. (See [[Gender-neutrality in genderless languages]])
* [[Grammatical gender]] is a property of some languages in which every [[noun]] is assigned a gender, often with no direct relation to its meaning. For example, the word for "girl" is ''[[:es:muchacha|muchacha]]'' (grammatically feminine) in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''[[:de:Mädchen|Mädchen]]'' (grammatically neuter) in [[German language|German]], and ''[[:ga:cailín|cailín]]'' (grammatically masculine) in [[Irish language|Irish]].
* The term "[[grammatical gender]]" is often applied to more complex [[noun class]] systems. This is especially true when a noun class system includes masculine and feminine as well as some other non-gender features like animate, edible, manufactured, and so forth. An example of the latter is found in the [[Dyirbal language]]. Other gender systems exist with no distinction between masculine and feminine; examples include a distinction between animate and inanimate things, which is common to, amongst others, [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]], [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Hittite language|Hittite]]; and systems distinguishing between people (whether human or divine) and everything else, which are found in the [[Dravidian languages]] and [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]].

Historically, science has been portrayed as a masculine pursuit in which women have faced significant barriers to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schiebinger|first1=Londa|title=Has Feminism Changed Science?|date=2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-0-674-00544-0|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after universities began admitting women in the 19th century, women were still largely relegated to certain scientific fields, such as [[home science]], [[nursing]], and [[child psychology]].&lt;ref name="Sheffield2006"&gt;{{cite book|title=Women and Science: Social Impact and Interaction|date=2006|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-3737-5|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=129–134|last1=Sheffield|first1=Suzanne Le-May}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were also typically given tedious, low-paying jobs and denied opportunities for career advancement.&lt;ref name="Sheffield2006" /&gt; This was often justified by the stereotype that women were naturally more suited to jobs that required concentration, patience, and dexterity, rather than creativity, leadership, or intellect.&lt;ref name="Sheffield2006" /&gt; Although these stereotypes have been dispelled in modern times, women are still underrepresented in prestigious "[[Hard and soft science|hard science]]" fields such as [[physics]], and are less likely to hold high-ranking positions.&lt;ref name="Eisenhart1998"&gt;{{cite book|title=Women's Science: Learning and Succeeding from the Margins|journal=Science Education|volume=84|issue=6|last2=Finkel|first2=Elizabeth|date=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-19544-5|location=Chicago|pages=34–36|last1=Eisenhart|first1=Margaret A.|bibcode=2000SciEd..84..793A|doi=10.1002/1098-237X(200011)84:6&lt;793::AID-SCE6&gt;3.0.CO;2-K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
{{further|Gender and religion}}
This topic includes internal and external religious issues such as [[Gender of God|gender of God and deities]] creation myths about human gender, roles and rights (for instance, leadership roles especially [[ordination of women]], [[sex segregation]], gender equality, marriage, abortion, [[Homosexuality and religion|homosexuality]])

According to Kati Niemelä of the Church Research Institute, women are universally more [[religious]] than men. They believe that the difference in religiosity between genders is due to biological differences, for instance usually people seeking security in life are more religious, and as men are considered to be greater risk takers than women, they are less religious. Although [[religious fanaticism]] is more often seen in men than women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/news/2010/08/women_more_religious_than_men_1939513.html Women More Religious than Men]. yle.fi (29 August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yin yang.svg|thumb|100px|[[Yin and yang|''yin'' and ''yang'']]]]
In [[Taoism]], [[yin and yang]] are considered feminine and masculine, respectively. The Taijitu and concept of the Zhou period reach into family and gender relations. Yin is female and yang is male. They fit together as two parts of a whole.
The male principle was equated with the sun: active, bright, and shining; the female principle corresponds to the moon: passive, shaded, and reflective. Male toughness was balanced by female gentleness, male action and initiative by female endurance and need for completion, and male leadership by female supportiveness.

In [[Judaism]], [[God]] is traditionally described in the masculine, but in the mystical tradition of the [[Kabbalah]], the [[Shekhinah]] represents the feminine aspect of God's essence. However, Judaism [[Jewish principles of faith|traditionally holds]] that God is completely non-corporeal, and thus neither male nor female. Conceptions of the gender of God notwithstanding, traditional Judaism places a strong emphasis on individuals following Judaism's traditional gender roles, though many modern [[Jewish religious movements|denominations of Judaism]] strive for greater egalitarianism. As well, traditional Jewish culture dictates that there are [[Gender and Judaism|six genders]].

In [[Christianity]], God is traditionally described in masculine terms and the Church has historically been described in feminine terms. On the other hand, Christian [[theology]] in many churches distinguishes between the masculine images used of God (Father, King, God the Son) and the reality they signify, which transcends gender, embodies all the virtues of both men and women perfectly, which may be seen through the doctrine of [[Imago Dei]]. In the [[New Testament]], Jesus at several times mentions with the masculine pronoun i.e. John 15:26 among other verses. Hence, [[God the Father|the Father]], [[God the Son|the Son]] and [[the Holy Spirit]] (i.e. [[Trinity]]) are all mentioned with the masculine pronoun; though the exact meaning of the masculinity of the Christian triune God is contended.

In [[Hinduism]]

{{quote|One of the several forms of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] God [[Shiva]], is Ardhanarishwar (literally half-female God). Here Shiva manifests himself so that the left half is Female and the right half is Male. The left represents Shakti (energy, power) in the form of Goddess [[Parvati]] (otherwise his consort) and the right half Shiva. Whereas Parvati is the cause of arousal of Kama (desires), Shiva is the killer. Shiva is pervaded by the power of Parvati and Parvati is pervaded by the power of Shiva.

While the stone images may seem to represent a half-male and half-female God, the true symbolic representation is of a being the whole of which is Shiva and the whole of which is Shakti at the same time. It is a 3-D representation of only shakti from one angle and only Shiva from the other. Shiva and Shakti are hence the same being representing a collective of Jnana (knowledge) and Kriya (activity).

Adi Shankaracharya, the founder of non-dualistic philosophy (Advaita–"not two") in Hindu thought says in his "Saundaryalahari"—''Shivah Shaktayaa yukto yadi bhavati shaktah prabhavitum na che devum devona khalu kushalah spanditam api'' " i.e., It is only when Shiva is united with Shakti that He acquires the capability of becoming the Lord of the Universe. In the absence of Shakti, He is not even able to stir. In fact, the term "Shiva" originated from "Shva," which implies a dead body. It is only through his inherent shakti that Shiva realizes his true nature.

This mythology projects the inherent view in ancient Hinduism, that each human carries within himself both female and male components, which are forces rather than sexes, and it is the harmony between the creative and the annihilative, the strong and the soft, the proactive and the passive, that makes a true person. Such thought, leave alone entail gender equality, in fact obliterates any material distinction between the male and female altogether. This may explain why in ancient India we find evidence of homosexuality, bisexuality, androgyny, [[multiple sex partners]] and open representation of sexual pleasures in artworks like the Khajuraho temples, being accepted within prevalent social frameworks.|&lt;ref name="vohra"&gt;"The Male-Female Hologram," Ashok Vohra, [[Times of India]], March 8, 2005, Page 9&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a number of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|North American Indigenous]] cultures, non-man/-woman individuals sometimes carried specific roles within that nation's religious structures. These could be the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] wíŋkte, [[Navajo]] ''{{spell-nv|[[Nádleehi]]|nádleeh}}'', [[Ojibwe|Anishinaabe]] niizh manidoowag and hundreds more. Recently, North American Native Americans and First Nations have adopted the term [[Two-Spirit]] to refer to the mosaic of different genders cross-culturally.

=== Poverty ===
{{Main|Feminization of poverty}}

[[Gender inequality]] is most common in women dealing with poverty. Many women must shoulder all the responsibility of the household because they must take care of the family. Oftentimes this may include tasks such as tilling land, grinding grain, carrying water and cooking.&lt;ref name=UNPD&gt;[http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/ourwork/povertyreduction/focus_areas/focus_gender_and_poverty/ Gender and Poverty Reduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029203731/http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/ourwork/povertyreduction/focus_areas/focus_gender_and_poverty/ |date=29 October 2014 }}. UNPD.org. 29 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Also, women are more likely to earn low incomes because of gender discrimination, as men are more likely to receive higher pay, have more opportunities, and have overall more political and social capital then women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1987|title=The Feminization of Poverty|journal=Journal of Economic Issues|volume=21|issue=1|pages=329–337|jstor=4225831|author=Peterson, Janice|doi=10.1080/00213624.1987.11504613}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 75% of world's women are unable to obtain bank loans because they have unstable jobs.&lt;ref name=UNPD /&gt; It shows that there are many women in the world's population but only a few represent world's wealth.

[http://www.dandc.eu/articles/220419/index.en.shtml Smart finance]. D+C Development and Cooperation&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 Diana M.

Gender and Development (GAD) is a holistic approach to give aid to countries where gender inequality has a great effect of not improving the social and economic development. It is a program focused on the gender development of women to empower them and decrease the level of inequality between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2008|title=The 'Feminisation of Poverty' and the 'Feminisation' of Anti-Poverty Programmes: Room for Revision?|journal=Journal of Development Studies|volume=44|issue=2|pages=165–197|doi=10.1080/00220380701789810|last1=Chant|first1=Sylvia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== General strain theory ===
According to [[general strain theory]], studies suggest that gender differences between individuals can lead to externalized anger that may result in violent outbursts.&lt;ref name="Agnew, Robert 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2012|title=Reflection on "A Revised Strain Theory of Delinquency"|journal=Social Forces|volume=91|pages=33–38|doi=10.1093/sf/sos117|last1=Agnew|first1=R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These violent actions related to [[gender inequality]] can be measured by comparing violent neighborhoods to non-violent neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="Agnew, Robert 2012" /&gt; By noticing the independent variables (neighborhood violence) and the dependent variable (individual violence), it's possible to analyze gender roles.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Kempf-Leonard|first2=K.|last3=Mullins|first3=C.|year=2014|title=Gender and Juvenile Drug Abuse: A General Strain Theory Perspective|journal=Women &amp; Criminal Justice|volume=24|pages=22–43|doi=10.1080/08974454.2013.842519|last1=Grothoff|first1=G. E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strain in the general strain theory is the removal of a positive stimulus and or the introduction of a negative stimulus, which would create a negative effect (strain) within individual, which is either inner-directed (depression/guilt) or outer-directed (anger/frustration), which depends on whether the individual blames themselves or their environment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Blurton|first2=D.|last3=McCluskey|first3=J.D.|year=2007|title=General Strain Theory and Delinquency: Focusing on the Influences of Key Strain Characteristics on Delinquency|journal=Crime &amp; Delinquency|volume=54|issue=4|pages=582–613|doi=10.1177/0011128707301627|last1=Moon|first1=B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies reveal that even though males and females are equally likely to react to a strain with anger, the origin of the anger and their means of coping with it can vary drastically.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; Males are likely to put the blame on others for adversity and therefore externalize feelings of anger.&lt;ref name="Agnew, Robert 2012" /&gt; Females typically internalize their angers and tend to blame themselves instead.&lt;ref name="Agnew, Robert 2012" /&gt; Female internalized anger is accompanied by feelings of guilt, fear, anxiety and depression.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com" /&gt; Women view anger as a sign that they've somehow lost control, and thus worry that this anger may lead them to harm others and/or damage relationships. On the other end of the spectrum, men are less concerned with damaging relationships and more focused on using anger as a means of affirming their masculinity.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com" /&gt; According to the general strain theory, men would more likely engage in aggressive behavior directed towards others due to externalized anger whereas women would direct their anger towards themselves rather than others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

=== Economic development ===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2016}}
Gender, and particularly the role of women is widely recognized as vitally important to [[international development]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;Adema, W., Ali, N., Frey, V., Kim, H., Lunati, M., Piacentini, M. and Queisser, M. (2014). Enhancing Women's Economic Empowerment Through Entrepreneurship and Business leadership in OECD Countries. OECD.&lt;/ref&gt; This often means a focus on gender-equality, ensuring [[participation (decision making)|participation]], but includes an understanding of the different roles and expectation of the genders within the community.&lt;ref&gt;OECD, ILO, IMF and WBG, (2014). Achieving stronger growth by promoting a more genderbalanced economy. Report prepared for the G20 Labour and Employment Ministerial Meeting. Melbourne, Australia: G20 Labour and Employment Ministerial Meeting.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, the study of gender and development has become a broad field that involves politicians, economists, and [[human rights defender|human rights activists]]. Gender and Development, unlike previous theories concerning women in development, includes a broader view of the effects of development on gender including economic, political, and social issues. The theory takes a holistic approach to development and its effects on women and recognizes the negative effects gender blind development policies have had on women. Prior to 1970, it was believed that development affected men and women in the same way and no gendered perspective existed for development studies. However, the 1970s saw a transformation in development theory that sought to incorporate women into existing development paradigms.

When [[Ester Boserup]] published her book, ''Woman’s Role in Economic Development'', there was a realization that development affected men and women differently and there began to be more of a focus on women and development. Boserup argued that women were marginalized in the modernization process and practices of growth, development, and development policy threatened to actually make women worse off.
Boserup's work translated into the beginning of a larger discourse termed [[Women in Development]] (WID) coined by the Women's Committee of the Washington DC Chapter of the [[Society for International Development]], a network of female development professionals. The primary goal of WID was to include women into existing development initiatives, since it was argued that women were marginalized and excluded from the benefits of development. In so doing, the WID approach pointed out that the major problem to women's unequal representation and participation were male biased and patriarchal development policies. In short, the WID approach blamed patriarchy, which did not consider women's productive and reproductive work. In fact, women were tied to domestic work hence were almost invisible in development programs. The WID approach, however, began to gain criticism as ignoring how women's economic [[marginalization]] was linked to the development model itself.

Some feminists{{who|date=July 2016}} argued that the key concept for women and development should be subordination in the context of new capitalist forms of insecure and hierarchical job structures, rather than marginalization as WID approaches emphasized. The rise of criticism against the WID approach led to the emergence of a new theory, that of Women and Development (WAD).{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

However, just as WID had its critics, so did WAD. Critics{{who|date=July 2016}} of WAD argued that it failed to sufficiently address the differential power relations between women and men, and tended to overemphasize women's productive as opposed to reproductive roles. Also, rising criticism of the exclusion of men in WID and WAD led to a new theory termed [[Gender and Development]] (GAD). Drawing from insights developed in psychology, sociology, and gender studies, GAD theorists shifted from understanding women's problems as based on their sex (i.e. their biological differences from men) to understanding them as based on gender – the social relations between women and men, their social construction, and how women have been systematically subordinated in this relationship.

At their most fundamental, GAD perspectives link the social relations of production with the social relations of reproduction – exploring why and how women and men are assigned to different roles and responsibilities in society, how these dynamics are reflected in social, economic, and political theories and institutions, and how these relationships affect development policy effectiveness. According to proponents of GAD, women are cast not as passive recipients of development aid, but rather as active agents of change whose empowerment should be a central goal of development policy. In contemporary times, most literature and institutions that are concerned with women's role in development incorporate a GAD perspective, with the United Nations taking the lead of mainstreaming the GAD approach through its system and development policies.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have highlighted that policy dialogue on the [[Millennium Development Goals]] needs to recognize that the gender dynamics of power, poverty, [[social vulnerability|vulnerability]] and care link all the goals.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2386&amp;title=gender-mdgs-gender-lens-vital-pro-poor-results |title=Gender and the MDGS |date=September 2008 |publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310100258/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2386&amp;title=gender-mdgs-gender-lens-vital-pro-poor-results |archivedate=10 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The various United Nations international women's conferences in Beijing, Mexico City, Copenhagen, and Nairobi, as well as the development of the Millennium Development Goals in 2000 have taken a GAD approach and holistic view of development. The [[United Nations Millennium Declaration]] signed at the United Nations Millennium Summit in 2000 including eight goals that were to be reached by 2015, and although it would be a difficult task to reach them, all of them could be monitored. The eight goals are:
# Halve the proportion of people living in extreme poverty at the 1990 level by 2015.
# Achieve universal primary education
# Promote gender equality and empower women
# Reduce child mortality rates
# Improve maternal health
# Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria and other diseases
# Ensure environmental sustainability
# Global partnership

The MDGs have three goals specifically focused on women: Goal 3, 4 and 5 but women's issues also cut across all of the goals. These goals overall comprise all aspects of women's lives including economic, health, and political participation.

[[Gender equality]] is also strongly linked to [[education]]. The [[Dakar Framework for Action]] (2000) set out ambitious goals: to eliminate gender disparities in primary and secondary education by 2005, and to achieve gender equality in education by 2015. The focus was on ensuring girls' full and equal access to and achievement in good quality basic education. The gender objective of the Dakar Framework for Action is somewhat different from the MDG Goal 3 (Target 1): "Eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education, preferably by 2005, and in all levels of education no later than 2015". MDG Goal 3 does not comprise a reference to learner achievement and good quality basic education, but goes beyond the school level. Studies demonstrate the positive impact of girls' education on child and maternal health, fertility rates, poverty reduction and economic growth. Educated mothers are more likely to send their children to school.&lt;ref name="Achieving Gender Equality"&gt;[http://www.iiep.unesco.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Info_Services_Newsletter/pdf/eng/2010/2010_1En.pdf IIEP Newsletter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716103610/http://www.iiep.unesco.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Info_Services_Newsletter/pdf/eng/2010/2010_1En.pdf |date=16 July 2011 }}, Achieving Gender Equality in Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organizations working in developing countries and in the development field have incorporated advocacy and empowerment for women into their work. The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations (FAO) adopted a 10-year strategic framework in November 2009 that includes the strategic objective of gender equity in access to resources, goods, services and decision-making in rural areas, and mainstreams gender equity in all FAO's programs for agriculture and rural development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/gender/gender-home/gender-programme/gender-equity/en/|title= Gender equity|date=November 2009|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association for Progressive Communications]] (APC) has developed a [[Gender Evaluation Methodology]] for planning and evaluating development projects to ensure they benefit all sectors of society including women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genderevaluation.net/ Gender Evaluation Methodology (GEM)]. genderevaluation.net&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gender-related Development Index (GDI), developed by the United Nations, aims to show the inequalities between men and women in the following areas: long and healthy life, knowledge, and a decent standard of living. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has introduced indicators designed to add a gendered dimension to the Human Development Index (HDI). Additionally, in 1995, the [[Gender-related Development Index]] (GDI) and the [[Gender Empowerment Measure]] (GEM) were introduced. More recently, in 2010, UNDP introduced a new indicator, the [[Gender Inequality Index]] (GII), which was designed to be a better measurement of gender inequality and to improve the shortcomings of GDI and GEM.

=== Climate change ===
{{Main|Climate change and gender}}
Gender is a topic of increasing concern within [[climate change]] policy and science.&lt;ref name="Olsson"&gt;Olsson, Lennart'' et al.''

Part A: Global and Sectoral Aspects. Contribution of Working Group II to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.'' Ed. C.B. Field et al. Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, gender approaches to climate change address gender-differentiated consequences of climate change, as well as unequal [[adaptation to global warming|adaptation]] capacities and gendered contribution to climate change. Furthermore, the intersection of climate change and gender raises questions regarding the complex and [[intersectionality|intersecting]] power relations arising from it. These differences, however, are mostly not due to biological or physical differences, but are formed by the social, institutional and legal context. Subsequently, [[vulnerability]] is less an intrinsic feature of women and girls but rather a product of their marginalization.&lt;ref name="Birkmann"&gt;Birkmann, Joern et al.

Some feminist scholars hold that the debate on climate change is not only dominated by men but also primarily shaped in ‘masculine’ principles, which limits discussions about climate change to a perspective that focuses on technical solutions.&lt;ref name="Tuana" /&gt; This perception of climate change hides subjectivity and power relations that actually condition climate-change policy and science, leading to a phenomenon that Tuana&lt;ref name="Tuana" /&gt; terms ‘epistemic injustice’.
Similarly, MacGregor&lt;ref name="MacGregor"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2010|title=A stranger silence still: The need for feminist social research on climate change|journal=The Sociological Review|volume=57|issue=2_suppl|pages=124–140|doi=10.1111/j.1467-954X.2010.01889.x|last1=MacGregor|first1=S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; attests that by framing climate change as an issue of ‘hard’ natural scientific conduct and natural security, it is kept within the traditional domains of hegemonic masculinity.&lt;ref name="MacGregor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyd" /&gt;

=== Social media ===
Gender roles and stereotypes have slowly started to change in society within the past few decades. These changes occur mostly in communication, but more specifically during social interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Eisenstein|first2=Jacob|last3=Schnoebelen|first3=Tyler|date=April 2014|title=Gender identity and lexical variation in social media|journal=Journal of Sociolinguistics|volume=18|issue=2|pages=135–160|doi=10.1111/josl.12080|last1=Bamman|first1=David|arxiv=1210.4567}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ways in which people communicate and socialize have also started to change due to advancements in technology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayat|first=Tsahi (Zack)|last2=Lesser|first2=Ofrit|last3=Samuel-Azran|first3=Tal|title=Gendered discourse patterns on online social networks: A social network analysis perspective|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=77|pages=132–139|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2017.08.041|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the biggest reasons for this change is the growth of [[social media]].

Over the past few years, the use of social media globally has started to rise.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lesser|first=Ofrit|last2=Hayat|first2=Tsahi (Zack)|last3=Elovici|first3=Yuval|date=2017-11-02|title=The role of network setting and gender in online content popularity|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|volume=20|issue=11|pages=1607–1624|doi=10.1080/1369118x.2016.1252411|issn=1369-118X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This rise can be attributed to the abundance of technology available for use among youth. Recent studies suggest that men and women value and use technology differently.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Wilson|first2=S.A.|last3=DuFrene|first3=D.D.|date=14 October 2011|title=The Social Networking Arena: Battle of the Sexes|journal=Business Communication Quarterly|volume=75|issue=1|pages=64–67|doi=10.1177/1080569911423961|last1=Clipson|first1=T.W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forbes published an article in 2010 that reported 57% of Facebook users are women, which was attributed to the fact that women are more active on social media. On average women have 8% more friends and account for 62% of posts that are shared via Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gourdreau |first1=Jenna |date=26 April 2010 |title=What men and women are doing on Facebook |work=Forbes |url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/04/26/popular-social-networking-sites-forbes-woman-time-facebook-twitter.html |accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study in 2010 found that in most Western cultures, women spend more time sending text messages compared to men as well as spending more time on social networking sites as a way to communicate with friends and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Tufekci |first1=Zeynep |title=Gender, social capital and social network(ing) sites: Women bonding, men searching |publisher=American Sociological Association |url=http://research.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/4/2/6/9/p242696_index.html |accessdate=14 April 2016|date=2008-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayat, Lesser and Samuel-Azran (2017) have further shown that while men write more posts in social networking sites, women commented on other people's posts more often. They further showed that women's posts enjoyed higher popularity than men's post''s.''

Social media is more than just the communication of words. With social media increasing in popularity, pictures have come to play a large role in how many people communicate. Research conducted in 2013 found that over 57% of pictures posted on social networking sites were sexual and were created to gain attention.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Araüna-Baró|first2=Núria|last3=Martínez-Martínez|first3=Inmaculada José|date=1 June 2013|title=Advertising Stereotypes and Gender Representation in Social Networking Sites|journal=Comunicar|volume=21|issue=41|pages=177–186|doi=10.3916/C41-2013-17|last1=Tortajada-Giménez|first1=Iolanda}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, 58% of women and 45% of men don't look into the camera, which creates an illusion of withdrawal.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Other factors to be considered are the poses in pictures such as women lying down in subordinate positions or even touching themselves in childlike ways.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Research has found that images shared online through social networking sites help establish personal self-reflections that individuals want to share with the world.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

According to recent research, gender plays a strong role in structuring our social lives, especially since society assigns and creates "male" and "female" categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hodkinson|first1=P.|title=Bedrooms and beyond: Youth, identity and privacy on social network sites|journal=New Media &amp; Society|volume=19|issue=2|pages=272–288|date=22 September 2015|doi=10.1177/1461444815605454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals in society might be able to learn the similarities between gender rather than the differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Mackey-Kallis|first2=Susan|last3=Shyles|first3=Len|last4=Barry|first4=Kelly|last5=Biagini|first5=Danielle|last6=Hart|first6=Colleen|last7=Jack|first7=Lauren|date=November 2012|title=Face it: The Impact of Gender on Social Media Images|journal=Communication Quarterly|volume=60|issue=5|pages=588–607|doi=10.1080/01463373.2012.725005|last1=Rose|first1=Jessica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media helps create more equality, because every individual is able to express him- or herself however they like. Every individual also has the right to express their opinion, even though some might disagree, but it still gives each gender an equal amount of power to be heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schwartz |first1=HA |last2=Eichstaedt |first2=JC |last3=Kern |first3=ML |last4=Dziurzynski |first4=L |last5=Ramones |first5=SM |last6=Agrawal |first6=M |last7=Shah |first7=A |last8=Kosinski |first8=M |last9=Stillwell |first9=D |last10=Seligman |first10=ME |last11=Ungar |first11=LH |title=Personality, gender, and age in the language of social media: the open-vocabulary approach. |journal=PLOS One |date=2013 |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=e73791 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0073791 |pmid=24086296|pmc=3783449 |bibcode=2013PLoSO...873791S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young adults in the U.S. frequently use social networking sites as a way to connect and communicate with one another, as well as to satisfy their curiosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Explaining why young adults use MySpace and Facebook through uses and gratifications theory|last2=Dong|first2=Q|last3=Day|first3=K.D|date=2009|edition=2|pages=215–229|last1=Urista|first1=M.A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescent girls generally use social networking sites as a tool to communicate with peers and reinforce existing relationships; boys on the other hand tend to use social networking sites as a tool to meet new friends and acquaintances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Older adolescents' motivations for social network site use: The influence of gender, group identity, and collective self-esteem|publisher=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior|edition=2|pages=209–213|last1=Barker|first1=V}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, social networking sites have allowed individuals to truly express themselves, as they are able to create an identity and socialize with other individuals that can relate.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Ridder|first1=Sander|last2=van Bauwel|first2=Sofie|title=Youth and intimate media cultures: Gender, sexuality, relationships, and desire as storytelling practices in social networking sites|journal=Communications|date=1 January 2015|volume=40|issue=3|doi=10.1515/commun-2015-0012|url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/5889652/file/7011376.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social networking sites have also given individuals access to create a space where they feel more comfortable about their sexuality.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Recent research has indicated that social media is becoming a stronger part of younger individuals' media culture, as more intimate stories are being told via social media and are being intertwined with gender, sexuality, and relationships.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Teens are avid internet and social media users in the United States. Research has found that almost all U.S. teens (95%) aged 12 through 17 are online, compared to only 78% of adults. Of these teens, 80% have profiles on social media sites, as compared to only 64% of the online population aged 30 and older. According to a study conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 11-to-18 year-olds spend on average over one and a half hours a day using a computer and 27 minutes per day visiting social network sites, i.e. the latter accounts for about one fourth of their daily computer use.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herring|first1=Susan|last2=Kapidzic|first2=Sanja|title=Teens, Gender, and Self-Presentation in Social Media|date=2015|publisher=International encyclopedia of social and behavioral sciences|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teen girls and boys differ in what they post in their online profiles. Studies have shown that female users tend to post more "cute" pictures, while male participants were more likely to post pictures of themselves in activities. Women in the U.S. also tend to post more pictures of friends, while men tend to post more about sports and humorous links. The study also found that males would post more alcohol and sexual references.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; The roles were reversed however, when looking at a teenage dating site: women made sexual references significantly more often than males.

Boys share more personal information, such as their hometown and phone number, while girls are more conservative about the personal information they allow to go public on these social networking sites. Boys, meanwhile, are more likely to orient towards technology, sports, and humor in the information they post to their profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malin|first1=Sveningsson Elm|title=Doing and undoing gender in a Swedish Internet community|url=http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kau:diva-18434|accessdate=14 April 2016|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media goes beyond the role of helping individuals express themselves, as it has grown to help individuals create relationships, particularly romantic relationships. A large number of social media users have found it easier to create relationships in a less direct approach, compared to a traditional approach of awkwardly asking for someone's number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Role of Facebook in Romantic Relationship Development: An Exploration of Knapp's Relational Stage Model|date=2012|publisher=Conference Papers – International Communication Association|pages=1–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media plays a big role when it comes to communication between genders. Therefore it's important to understand how gender stereotypes develop during online interactions. Research in the 1990s suggested that different genders display certain traits, such as being active, attractive, dependent, dominant, independent, sentimental, sexy, and submissive, in online interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Gauntlett|first1=D|title=Google Books|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ScR9AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=gender%2Band%2Bsocial%2Bmedia#v=onepage&amp;q=gender%20and%20social%20media|website=Media, Gender and Identity|accessdate=14 April 2016|isbn=978-1-134-15502-6|date=2008-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though these traits continue to be displayed through gender stereotypes, recent studies show that this isn't necessarily the case any more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Herring|first1=I|title=Teens, Gender, and Self-Presentation in Social Media. Sciences|url=http://info.ils.indiana.edu/~herring/teens.gender.pdf|publisher=Oxford|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Comparison Bioresilience with Biodiversity.jpg|thumb|Comparing the Features of Bioresilience and Biodiversity as Found on a Mountain Slope]]
'''Bioresilience''' refers to the ability of a whole [[species]] or an [[individual]] of a species to adapt to change. Initially the term applied to changes in the [[natural environment]], but increasingly it is also used for adaptation to anthropogenically induced change.&lt;ref name=r0&gt;{{Cite journal|date = 2014 | title = Vanishing fauna (Special issue)|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=345|issue=6195| pages = 392–412 |url =http://www.sciencemag.org/site/special/vanishing/index.xhtml?_ga=1.172413478.429831163.1471029002 |doi= 10.1126/science.345.6195.392| bibcode=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Alexander von Humboldt]] was the first to note the resilience of [[life forms]] with increasing [[altitude]] and the accompanying decreasing prevalence in numbers, and he documented this in the 18th century on the slopes of the volcano [[Chimborazo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Andrea |last=Wulf |title=The Invention of Nature |location=New York |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |title=Alexander von Humboldt and the General Physics of the Earth |first=Stephen T. |last=Jackson |volume=324 |pages=596–597 |url=http://faculty.jsd.claremont.edu/dmcfarlane/bio176mcfarlane/pdf%20papers/Humboldt%20hsitory.pdf |doi=10.1126/science.1171659}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding of bioresilience evolved from research led by [[The Mountain Institute]] when establishing two of the national parks that surround [[Mount Everest]], [[Makalu-Barun National Park]] in [[Nepal]], and [[Qomolangma National Nature Preserve]] in the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] of [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=T.B |last=Shrestha |title=Development Ecology of the Arun River Basin in Nepal |location=Kathmandu |publisher=International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research documented greater [[biodiversity]] at Everest’s base than higher up. There were progressively fewer documented species as the mountain ascended into higher [[biomes]], from [[subtropical]] to [[temperate]] to [[Alpine climate|alpine]] to Arctic-like. These fewer species, though, had greater biologic [[robustness]] correlating directly with increasing bioresilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Daniel |last=Taylor-Ide |title=Something Hidden Behind the Ranges: A Himalayan Quest |location=San Francisco |publisher=Mercury House |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Current research==
Monitoring of bioresilience, beginning in the [[Everest]] ecosystem but expanding to other mountain ecologies globally is being carried out by the Biomeridian Project at [[Future Generations University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding Impacts on Life from Climate Change|url=https://www.future.edu/biomeridian/|website=Future Generations University|accessdate=October 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of bioresilience has also been applied to human health to explain aging or chronic diseases decrease the ability of the body to adapt; in such cases, the system becomes rigid and unable to cross different life demands. As the human body loses robustness with age, an individual becomes unable to accommodate new life demands, be they contagions, stress, or events such as injury or even jet lag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Yun |first=Joon | title=The Key To Health In Old Age: Bioresilience | website=[[Forbes]] | date=June 18, 2018 |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2018/06/18/the-key-to-health-in-old-age-bioresillience/|accessdate=October 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of resilience in biological systems has been widely recognized in terms of the impacts on life by anthropogenic changes.&lt;ref name=r0/&gt; Accelerating environmental change and continuing loss of genetic resources positions lower biodiversity around the planet threatening ecosystem services. A major mitigating factor will be life forms with higher resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Oliver |first=Tom H. |last2= Heard |first2=Mathew S. |first3= Nick J.B. |last3=Isaac |last4= Roy |first4=David B. |first5=Deborah |last5=Procter |first6=Felix |last6=Eigenbrod |first7=Rob |last7=Freckleton |first8=Andy |last8=Hector |first9=C. David L. |last9=Orme |first10=Owen L. |last10=Petchey |first11=Vânia |last11=Proença |first12=David |last12=Raffaelli |first13=K.

Paralleling the work in mountain environments, a growing number of studies is applying the concept of bioresilience to assess the robustness of life in other ecological systems challenged by the Anthropocene. One such study was with the adaptive renewal and natural perturbation in Lake Victoria, the world’s second largest freshwater lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Awiti |first=Alex O. |title=Biological Diversity and Resilience: Lessons from the Recovery of Cichlid Species in Lake Victoria |journal=[[Ecology &amp; Society]] |date=2011 |volume=16 |issue=1 |url=https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol16/iss1/art9/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is meta-stable, and involves the continuous adjustment of the asymmetric transbilayer lipid distribution, which is correlated with [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] depletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pages |first=Guilhem |last2=Yau |first2=Tsz W. |last3=Kuchel |first3=Philip W. |date=2010 |title=Erythrocyte shape reversion from echinocytes to discocytes: Kinetics via fast-measurement NMR diffusion-diffraction |url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/mrm.22457 |journal=Magnetic Resonance in Medicine |language=en |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=645–652 |doi=10.1002/mrm.22457 |via=[[Wiley (publisher)|Wiley]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology==
[[Erythrocytes]] are in the shape of a biconcave disc.&lt;ref name="kuchelfackerell" /&gt; It has been suggested that this shape is optimal for surface area to volume ratio, but this hypothesis has not been widely accepted. In addition, it has been suggested that the biconcave shape is needed to optimise the blood's flow properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Uzoigwe |first1=Chika |title=The human erythrocyte has developed the biconcave disc shape to optimise the flow properties of the blood in the large vessels |journal=[[Medical Hypotheses]]|volume=67 |issue=5 |pages=1159–63 |year=2006 |pmid=16797867 |doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2004.11.047 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

Biconcave shape of the red blood cells.
Mammalian red blood cells also known as erythrocyte are a cellular component of the blood which give the blood its characteristic red color and transport oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. Mature red blood cells are round and biconcave because they lack a nucleus and unlike other cells, red cells require a small amount of oxygen for its metabolism and most oxygen is freed into the tissues. The absence of nucleus, ribosomes, and mitochondria partly contributes to the red blood cell’s disc-like structure which leaves room for hundreds of millions of hemoglobin molecules found within the cells. Hemoglobin is a red and iron-rich protein that merges with oxygen to carry oxygen from the lungs to the body tissues. Both sides of the cell surface bend inwards similar to the inner part of a sphere. 
The biconcave shape enhances the red blood cell's ability to maneuver through small blood vessels to transport oxygen to tissues and organs. The distinctive biconcave form also enhances the flow properties of blood in the major vessels. It minimizes platelet scatter and heightens laminar flow, which quells their atherogenic action in those major vessels. Erythrocytes, therefore, increase their applying exterior by assuming a cigar form, where they resourcefully release their oxygen load. The unique and flexible disc structure of red blood cell also helps increase the surface area to volume ratio of the tiny cells which enables oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to easily diffuse across the cell’s plasma membrane.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="862">{{short description|Method for measuring skin hydration}}
'''Corneometry''' is a widely practiced method for the measurement of skin [[Tissue hydration|hydration]]. It uses a capacitive sensor to measure the [[relative permittivity]] of upper skin layers. Because these depend on hydration of skin, the measured value is a measure for skin hydration&lt;ref&gt;C. W. Blichmann, J. Serup: ''Assessment of Skin Moisture'', Acta Derm. Venereol. (Stockli) 1988; 68: 284–290&lt;/ref&gt;.

The name ''corneometry'' is derived from the German trademark ''Corneometer''&lt;ref&gt;''Corneometer'': Entry in the German trademark register [https://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/marke/register/1007781/DE no. 1007781]&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1979 the first commercial instrument for measuring skin hydration was sold under this name.

== Localisation ==
Mouse and human ORMDL3 gene encode 153 [[Amino acid|aa]]. ORMDL family is consist of three members (ORMDL1-3)  witch are localised  in the membrane of [[Endoplasmic reticulum|endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER). Human ORMDL1, ORMDL2 and ORMDL3 are localised in [[Chromosome|chromosomes]] 2q32, 12q13.2 a 17q21.&lt;ref name="pmid12093374"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hjelmqvist L, Tuson M, Marfany G, Herrero E, Balcells S, Gonzàlez-Duarte R | title = ORMDL proteins are a conserved new family of endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = RESEARCH0027 | date = 2002 | pmid = 12093374 | pmc = 116724 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2002-3-6-research0027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
ORMDL3 plays role in [[sphingolipid]] synthesis like negative regulators. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Breslow DK, Collins SR, Bodenmiller B, Aebersold R, Simons K, Shevchenko A, Ejsing CS, Weissman JS | title = Orm family proteins mediate sphingolipid homeostasis | journal = Nature | volume = 463 | issue = 7284 | pages = 1048–53 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20182505 | doi = 10.1038/nature08787 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has a role in regulation  of  [[Calcium in biology|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] levels in the endoplasmic reticulum. ER is very important for generation, signalisation, functioning and store of  [[Calcium in biology|intracelular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]]. There are channels, whitch control the exit of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; from the ER into the [[cytoplasm]] and also [[Membrane pump|pumps]] (sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ATPase ([[SERCA]])) whitch return Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; back to the ER.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berridge MJ, Lipp P, Bootman MD | title = The versatility and universality of calcium signalling | journal = Nature Reviews.
