A '''product teardown''', or simply '''teardown''', is the act of disassembling a product, such that it helps to identify its component parts, chip &amp; system functionality, and component costing information. For products having 'secret' technology, such as the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25]], the process may be secret. For others, including [[consumer electronics]], the results are typically disseminated through photographs and component lists so that others can make use of the information without having to disassemble the product themselves. This information is important to designers of semiconductors, displays, batteries, packaging companies, integrated design firms, and semiconductor fabs, and the systems they operate within.

This information can be of interest to hobbyists, but can also be used commercially by the technical community to find out, for example, what semiconductor components are being utilized in consumer electronic products, such as the [[Wii]] video game console or [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iPhone]]. Such knowledge can aid understanding of how the product works, including innovative design features, and can facilitate estimating the [[bill of materials]] (BOM). The financial community therefore has an interest in teardowns, as knowing how a company's products are built can help guide a stock valuation. Manufacturers are often not allowed to announce what components are present in a product due to [[non-disclosure agreement]]s (NDA). Teardowns can also play a part in evidence of use in court and litigation proceedings where a companies parts may have been used without their permission, counterfeited, or to show where intellectual property or patents might be infringed by another firms part or system.

Identifying semiconductor components in systems has become more difficult over the past years. The most notable change started with Apple's 8GB iPod nano,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/design/audio-design/4016200/Tear-Down-Inside-the-Apple-8GB-iPod-nano|title=Tear Down: Inside the Apple 8GB iPod nano|last=Quirk|first=Gregory A.|date=2006-10-08|website=EE Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061110191819/http://www.wolfsonmicro.com/products/WM8750/ CODECs &amp;#x7C; WM8750 &amp;#x7C; Wolfson Microelectronics]&lt;/ref&gt; which were repackaged with Apple branding. This makes it more difficult to identify the actual device manufacturer and function of the component without performing a 'decap' – removing the outer packaging to analyze the [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]] within it. Typically there are markings on the die inside the package that can lead experienced engineers to see who actually created the device and what functionality it performs in the system.

A [[hypothetical technology]] is a technology that does not exist yet, but that has potential to exist in the future.

Hypothetical technologies are distinct from [[List of emerging technologies|emerging technologies]], which are new actual technologies, or developing technological fields presenting useful advances. 

As there is often only a thin line between fiction and hypothesis, this category may have considerable overlap with [[Fictional technology]].

Hypothetical technologies listed here should be:

* currently no such thing in actual existence
* not proven to be impossible
* not merely a (name for a) fictional idea

'''Technology fusion''' involves a transformation of core technologies through a combination process facilitated by technological advances such as the phone and the Internet, which ensure that labs are no longer isolated.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Market-Oriented Technology Management: Innovating for Profit in Entrepreneurial Times|last=Phillips|first=Fred|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=9783642074561|location=Berlin|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in profitable advances that can be made cheaply by combining knowledge from different fields, companies, industries, and geographies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The technological fusion is distinguished from the so-called breakthrough approach, which is the linear technological development that replaces an older generation of technology through its focus on combining existing technologies into hybrid products that can revolutionize markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/1992/07/technology-fusion-and-the-new-rd|title=Technology Fusion and the New R&amp;D|last=Kodama|first=Fumio|date=1992-07-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Fusion==
The fusion of technologies goes beyond mere combination. Fusion is more than complementarism, because it creates a new market and new growth opportunities for each participant in the innovation. It blends [[Incrementalism|incremental]] improvements from several (often previously separate) fields to create a product.&lt;ref name="Kodama1991"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kodama|first=Fumio|title=Analyzing Japanese High Technologies: The Techno-Paradigm Shift|publisher=Thomson Learning|date=September 1991|isbn=978-0-86187-835-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example is the fusion of mechanical and electronic engineering to create [[mechatronics]]. There is also the case of fusing chemical and electronics technology to produce the [[Liquid-crystal display|Liquid Crystal display]] (LCD) technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=R&amp;D and Economy in Korea: With Selected Multinational Cases &amp; Theories|last=Kim|first=Junmo|publisher=iUniverse|year=2005|isbn=9780595375257|location=Lincoln, NE|pages=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technology assessment''' ('''TA''', German: {{lang|de|Technikfolgenabschätzung}}, French: {{lang|fr|évaluation des choix scientifiques et technologiques}}) is a scientific, interactive, and communicative process that aims to contribute to the formation of public and political opinion on societal aspects of science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the commonly used definition given in the report of the EU-funded project TAMI (Technology Assessment – Methods and Impacts) in 2004: [http://www.ta-swiss.ch/?uid=45 ta-swiss.ch]&lt;/ref&gt;

== General description ==

TA is the study and evaluation of new technologies. It is based on the conviction that new developments within, and discoveries by, the scientific community are relevant for the world at large rather than just for the scientific experts themselves, and that technological progress can never be free of ethical implications. Also, technology assessment recognizes the fact that scientists normally are not trained [[ethicist]]s themselves and accordingly ought to be very careful when passing ethical judgement on their own, or their colleagues, new findings, projects, or work in progress.

Technology assessment assumes a global perspective and is future-oriented, not anti-technological. TA considers its task as an interdisciplinary approach to solving already existing problems and preventing potential damage caused by the uncritical application and the commercialization of new technologies.

Therefore, any results of technology assessment studies must be published, and particular consideration must be given to communication with political decision-makers.

An important problem concerning technology assessment is the so-called [[Collingridge dilemma]]: on the one hand, impacts of new technologies cannot be easily predicted until the technology is extensively developed and widely used; on the other hand, control or change of a technology is difficult as soon as it is widely used.

Technology assessments, which are a form of [[cost–benefit analysis]], are difficult if not impossible to carry out in an objective manner since subjective decisions and value judgments have to be made regarding a number of complex issues such as (a) the boundaries of the analysis (i.e., what costs are internalized and externalized), (b) the selection of appropriate indicators of potential positive and negative consequences of the new technology, (c) the monetization of non-market values, and (d) a wide range of ethical perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], Chapter 8, "The Positive Biases of Technology Assessments and Cost Benefit Analyses", New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}, 464 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, most technology assessments are neither objective nor value-neutral exercises but instead are greatly influenced and biased by the values of the most powerful stakeholders, which are in many cases the developers and proponents (i.e., corporations and governments) of new technologies under consideration. In the most extreme view, as expressed by Ian Barbour in  '’Technology, Environment, and Human Values'’, technology assessment is "a one-sided apology for contemporary technology by people with a stake in its continuation."&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, I.A. (1980). ''Technology, environment, and human values'', Praeger, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the major fields of TA are: information technology, [[hydrogen technologies]], [[nuclear technology]], [[molecular nanotechnology]], [[pharmacology]], [[organ donation|organ transplant]]s, [[biotechnology|gene technology]], [[artificial intelligence]], the Internet and many more. [[Health technology assessment]] is related, but profoundly different, despite the similarity in the name.

===Forms and concepts of technology assessment===
The following types of concepts of TA are those that are most visible and practiced. There are, however, a number of further TA forms that are only proposed as concepts in the literature or are the label used by a particular TA institution.&lt;ref&gt;Among those concepts one finds, for instance, '''Interactive TA''' [http://www.itas.fzk.de/deu/tadn/tadn298/rath298a.htm ITAS.fzk.de], '''Rational TA''' [http://www.ea-aw.com/the-europaeische-akademie/aimstasks.html EA-AW.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918235522/http://www.ea-aw.com/the-europaeische-akademie/aimstasks.html |date=September 18, 2010 }}, '''Real-time TA''' (cp. Guston/Sarewitz (2002) Real-time technology assessment, in: Technology in Society 24, 93–109), Innovation-oriented TA [http://www.innovationsanalysen.de Innovationsanalysen].&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Parliamentary TA (PTA)''': TA activities of various kinds whose addressee is a parliament. PTA may be performed directly by members of those parliaments (e.g. in France and Finland) or on their behalf of related TA institutions (such as in the UK, in Germany and Denmark) or by organisations not directly linked to a Parliament (such as in the Netherlands and Switzerland).&lt;ref&gt;Those TA institutions that perform PTA are organised in the [[European Parliamentary Technology Assessment]] (EPTA) network; see [http://eptanetwork.org EPTAnetwork.org].&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Expert TA''' (often also referred to as the '''classical TA''' or '''traditional TA''' concept): TA activities carried out by (a team of) TA and technical experts. Input from stakeholders and other actors is included only via written statements, documents and interviews, but not as in participatory TA.
* '''Participatory TA (pTA)''': TA activities which actively, systematically and methodologically involve various kinds of social actors as assessors and discussants, such as different kinds of civil society organisations, representatives of the state systems, but characteristically also individual stakeholders and citizens (lay persons), technical scientists and technical experts. Standard pTA methods include consensus conferences, focus groups, scenario workshops etc.&lt;ref&gt;Cp. the 2000 EUROpTA (European Participatory Technology Assessment – Participatory Methods in Technology Assessment and Technology Decision-Making) project report [http://www.tekno.dk/pdf/projekter/europta_Report.pdf TEKNO.dk].&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes pTA is further divided into '''expert-stakeholder pTA''' and '''public pTA''' (including lay persons).&lt;ref&gt;Van Eijndhoven (1997) Technology assessment: Product or process? in: Technological Forecasting and Social Change 54 (1997) 269–286.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Constructive TA (CTA)''': This concept of TA, developed in the Netherlands, but also applied&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://run.unl.pt/handle/10362/31566|title=Battery storage systems as balancing option in intermittent renewable energy systems - A transdisciplinary approach under the frame of Constructive Technology Assessment. PhD Thesis|last=Baumann|first=Manuel Johann|last2=|publisher=Universidade Nova de Lisboa|year=2017|isbn=|location=Lisbon|pages=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; and discussed elsewhere&lt;ref&gt;Schot/Rip (1997), The Past and Future of Constructive Technology Assessment in: Technological Forecasting &amp; Social Change 54, 251–268.&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to broaden the design of new technology through feedback of TA activities into the actual construction of technology. Contrary to other forms of TA, CTA is not directed toward influencing regulatory practices by assessing the impacts of technology. Instead, CTA wants to address social issues around technology by influencing design practices.
* '''Discursive TA''' or '''Argumentative TA''': This type of TA wants to deepen the political and normative debate about science, technology and society. It is inspired by ethics, policy discourse analysis and the sociology of expectations in science and technology. This mode of TA aims to clarify and bring under public and political scrutiny the normative assumptions and visions that drive the actors who are socially shaping science and technology. Accordingly, argumentative TA not only addresses the side effects of technological change, but deals with both broader impacts of science and technology and the fundamental normative question of why developing a certain technology is legitimate and desirable.&lt;ref&gt;van Est/Brom (2010) Technology assessment as an analytic and democratic practice, in: Encyclopedia of Applied Ethics.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Health TA (HTA)''': A specialised type of expert TA informing policy makers about efficacy, safety and cost effectiveness issues of pharmaceuticals and medical treatments, see [[health technology assessment]].

==Technology assessment institutions around the world==

Technology that is outdated (such as the [[8-track tape|8-track]]) or no longer used at all (such as the [[telegraph]]). Not all old technology belongs here - for example, while [[vinyl records]] were replaced by [[audio cassettes]] and [[CDs]] in the [[1980s]], they are making a comeback as a physical format as non-physical formats have made the CD and cassette obsolete, while vinyl is slowly becoming more common again.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Another example is an [[analog watch]]; though digital watches are a newer technology, they have not entirely replaced traditional watches because of the aesthetic or functional value of the original.

'''Engineering''' is the practical application of [[science]]. This is accomplished through [[knowledge]], [[mathematics]], and practical [[experience]] applied to the [[design]] of useful [[object (philosophy)|object]]s or [[Process (engineering)|processes]].  Professional practitioners of engineering are called [[engineer]]s.

&lt;/ref&gt; Electrification is believed to be the most important engineering achievement of the 20th century.]]

'''Technology''' ("science of craft", from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|τέχνη}}, ''techne'', "art, skill, cunning of hand"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[wikt:-logia|-logia]]''&lt;ref name="Liddell 1980"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Greek-English Lexicon (Abridged Edition)|first=Henry George|last2=Scott|first2=Robert|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1980|isbn=978-0-19-910207-5|location=United Kingdom|pages=|quote=|via=|author=Liddell|title-link=A Greek-English Lexicon}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the collection of [[Art techniques and materials|techniques]], [[skill]]s, [[Scientific method|methods]], and [[Business process|processes]] used in the production of [[Good (economics)|goods]] or [[Service (economics)|services]] or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as [[scientific investigation]]. Technology can be the [[knowledge]] of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in [[machines]] to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings. [[System]]s (e. g. machines) applying technology by taking an [[Input/output|input]], changing it according to the system's use, and then producing an [[Input/output|outcome]] are referred to as '''technology systems''' or '''technological systems'''.

The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic [[tool]]s. The [[prehistory|prehistoric]] discovery of [[Control of fire by early humans|how to control fire]] and the later [[Neolithic Revolution]] increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the [[wheel]] helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the [[printing press]], the [[telephone]], and the [[Internet]], have lessened physical barriers to [[communication]] and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale.

Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced [[economy|economies]] (including today's [[economic globalization|global economy]]) and has allowed the rise of a [[Conspicuous leisure|leisure class]]. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as [[pollution]] and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's [[natural environment|environment]]. Innovations have always influenced the [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] of a society and raised new questions of the [[ethics of technology]]. Examples include the rise of the notion of [[efficiency]] in terms of human [[productivity]], and the challenges of [[bioethics]].

Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the [[human condition]] or worsens it. [[Neo-Luddism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], and similar [[reactionary]] movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as [[transhumanism]] and [[techno-progressivism]] view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the [[human condition]].

== Definition and usage ==
[[File:Handtiegelpresse von 1811.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The spread of paper and printing to the West, as in this [[printing press]], helped [[scientist]]s and [[politician]]s communicate their ideas easily, leading to the [[Age of Enlightenment]]; an example of technology as cultural force.]]
The use of the term "technology" has changed significantly over the last 200 years. Before the 20th century, the term was uncommon in English, and it was used either to refer to the description or study of the [[useful arts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Universal Technological Dictionary, or Familiar Explanation of the Terms Used in All Arts and Sciences|last=Crabb|first=George|publisher=Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy|year=1823|isbn=|location=London|page=524|quote=|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to allude to technical education, as in the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (chartered in 1861).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mind and Hand: The Birth of MIT|last=Mannix|first=Loretta H.|last2=Stratton|first2=Julius Adams|publisher=MIT Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-262-19524-9|location=Cambridge|pages=190–92|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "technology" rose to prominence in the 20th century in connection with the [[Second Industrial Revolution]]. The term's meanings changed in the early 20th century when American social scientists, beginning with [[Thorstein Veblen]], translated ideas from the German concept of ''[[:de:Technik|Technik]]'' into "technology." In German and other European languages, a distinction exists between ''technik'' and ''technologie'' that is absent in English, which usually translates both terms as "technology." By the 1930s, "technology" referred not only to the study of the [[industrial arts]] but to the industrial arts themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Technik Comes to America: Changing Meanings of Technology Before 1930|journal=Technology and Culture|volume=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, the American sociologist Read Bain wrote that "technology includes all tools, machines, utensils, weapons, instruments, housing, clothing, communicating and transporting devices and the skills by which we produce and use them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Technology and State Government|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=2|issue=6|page=860|doi=10.2307/2084365|jstor=2084365|year=1937|last1=Bain|first1=Read}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bain's definition remains common among scholars today, especially social scientists.  Scientists and engineers usually prefer to define technology as [[applied science]], rather than as the things that people make and use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social Shaping of Technology|last=MacKenzie|first=Donald A.|last2=Wajcman|first2=Judy|publisher=Open University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-335-19913-6|edition=2nd|location=Buckingham|pages=|chapter=Introductory Essay|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, scholars have borrowed from European philosophers of "technique" to extend the meaning of technology to various forms of instrumental reason, as in [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s work on [[technologies of the self]] (''techniques de soi'').

Dictionaries and scholars have offered a variety of definitions. The ''[[Merriam-Webster's Advanced Learner's English Dictionary|Merriam-Webster Learner's Dictionary]]'' offers a definition of the term: "the use of science in industry, engineering, etc., to invent useful things or to solve problems" and "a machine, piece of equipment, method, etc., that is created by technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/technology|title=Technology {{!}} Definition of Technology by Merriam-Webster|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Merriam-Webster|access-date=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ursula Franklin]], in her 1989 "Real World of Technology" lecture, gave another definition of the concept; it is "practice, the way we do things around here."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Real World of Technology|last=Franklin|first=Ursula|publisher=House of Anansi|year=1999|isbn=978-0-88784-891-9|edition=revised|location=Scarborough|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is often used to imply a specific field of technology, or to refer to [[high technology]] or just [[consumer electronics]], rather than technology as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology|title=Technology|last=|first=|date=|work=BBC News|access-date=7 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard Stiegler]], in ''[[Technics and Time, 1]]'', defines technology in two ways: as "the pursuit of life by means other than life," and as "organized inorganic matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Stiegler |first=Bernard | title=Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus | year=1998 |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] | isbn=978-0-8047-3041-9 | pages=17, 82|title-link=Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus }} Stiegler has more recently stated that [[biotechnology]] can no longer be defined as "organized inorganic matter," given that it is, rather, "the reorganization of the organic." {{cite book | last=Stiegler |first=Bernard | title=L'avenir du passé: Modernité de l'archéologie | year=2008 |publisher=La Découverte | isbn=978-2-7071-5495-8 | page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology can be most broadly defined as the entities, both material and immaterial, created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value. In this usage, technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve real-world problems. It is a far-reaching term that may include simple tools, such as a [[Crowbar (tool)|crowbar]] or wooden [[spoon]], or more complex machines, such as a [[space station]] or [[particle accelerator]]. Tools and machines need not be material; {{anchor|Virtual technology}}virtual technology, such as [[computer software]] and [[business method]]s, fall under this definition of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind02/c6/c6s5.htm|title=Industry, Technology and the Global Marketplace: International Patenting Trends in Two New Technology Areas|last=|first=|date=|publisher=[[National Science Foundation]]|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/5902/20150818090057/https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind02/c6/c6s5.htm|archive-date=18 August 2005|dead-url=yes|website=Science and Engineering Indicators 2002|accessdate=7 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[W. Brian Arthur]] defines technology in a similarly broad way as "a means to fulfill a human purpose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arthur |first=W. Brian |date=2009 |title=The Nature of Technology |location=New York |publisher=Free Press |page=28 |isbn=978-1-4165-4405-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "technology" can also be used to refer to a collection of techniques. In this context, it is the current state of humanity's knowledge of how to combine resources to produce desired products, to solve problems, fulfill needs, or satisfy wants; it includes technical methods, skills, processes, techniques, tools and raw materials. When combined with another term, such as "medical technology" or "space technology," it refers to the state of the respective field's knowledge and tools. "[[State-of-the-art]] technology" refers to the [[high technology]] available to humanity in any field.

As a cultural activity, technology predates both [[science]] and [[engineering]], each of which formalize some aspects of technological endeavor.

==Science, engineering and technology==
[[File:Zoom lunette ardente.jpg|thumb|[[Antoine Lavoisier]] conducting an experiment with combustion generated by amplified sun light]]
The distinction between science, engineering, and technology is not always clear. [[Science]] is systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/science|title=Science|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Dictionary.com|publisher=|access-date=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technologies are not usually exclusively products of science, because they have to satisfy requirements such as [[utility]], [[usability]], and [[safety]].{{Citation needed|reason=This implies that some technologies are not product of science if they have utility, that seems wrong|date=August 2017}}

Engineering is the [[goal-oriented]] process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit natural phenomena for practical human means, often (but not always) using results and techniques from science. The development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge, including scientific, engineering, [[mathematics|mathematical]], [[language|linguistic]], and [[history|historical]] knowledge, to achieve some practical result.

Technology is often a consequence of science and engineering, although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields. For example, science might study the flow of [[electron]]s in [[electrical conductor]]s by using already-existing tools and knowledge. This new-found knowledge may then be used by engineers to create new tools and machines such as [[semiconductor]]s, [[computer]]s, and other forms of advanced technology. In this sense, scientists and engineers may both be considered technologists; the three fields are often considered as one for the purposes of research and reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intute.ac.uk/sciences/ |title=Intute: Science, Engineering and Technology |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=[[Intute]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217141847/http://www.intute.ac.uk/sciences/ |archive-date=17 February 2007 |dead-url=yes |accessdate=17 February 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact relations between science and technology in particular have been debated by scientists, historians, and policymakers in the late 20th century, in part because the debate can inform the funding of basic and applied science. In the immediate wake of [[World War II]], for example, it was widely considered in the United States that technology was simply "applied science" and that to fund basic science was to reap technological results in due time. An articulation of this philosophy could be found explicitly in [[Vannevar Bush]]'s treatise on postwar science policy, ''Science – The Endless Frontier'': "New products, new industries, and more jobs require continuous additions to knowledge of the laws of nature&amp;nbsp;... This essential new knowledge can be obtained only through basic scientific research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm#summary|title=Science the Endless Frontier|last=Bush|first=Vannevar|date=July 1945|website=|publisher=National Science Foundation|access-date=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late-1960s, however, this view came under direct attack, leading towards initiatives to fund science for specific tasks (initiatives resisted by the scientific community). The issue remains contentious, though most analysts resist the model that technology simply is a result of scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wise|first=George|year=1985|title=Science and Technology|journal=Osiris (2nd Series)|volume=1|pages=229–46|doi=10.1086/368647|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Between Politics and Science: Assuring the Integrity and Productivity of Research|last=Guston|first=David H.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-521-65318-3|location=New York|pages=|quote=|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other technological advances made during the Paleolithic era were [[clothing]] and shelter; the adoption of both technologies cannot be dated exactly, but they were a key to humanity's progress.

[[File:Néolithique 0001.jpg|thumb|An array of Neolithic artifacts, including bracelets, axe heads, chisels, and polishing tools]]

Human's technological ascent began in earnest in what is known as the [[Neolithic]] Period ("New Stone Age"). The invention of polished [[stone axe]]s was a major advance that allowed [[deforestation|forest clearance]] on a large scale to create farms. This use of polished stone axes increased greatly in the Neolithic, but were originally used in the preceding [[Mesolithic]] in some areas such as [[Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Driscoll|first1=Killian|title=The early prehistory in the west of Ireland: Investigations into the social archaeology of the Mesolithic, west of the Shannon, Ireland|date=2006|url=http://lithicsireland.ie/mlitt_mesolithic_west_ireland_chap_2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agriculture]] fed larger populations, and the transition to [[sedentism]] allowed simultaneously raising more children, as infants no longer needed to be carried, as [[nomad]]ic ones must. Additionally, children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could to the [[hunter-gatherer]] economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/01/060103114116.htm|title=The First Baby Boom: Skeletal Evidence Shows Abrupt Worldwide Increase In Birth Rate During Neolithic Period|last=University of Chicago Press Journals|first=|date=4 January 2006|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=7 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Child Transport, Family Size, and Increase in Human Population During the Neolithic|journal=[[Current Anthropology]]|author=Sussman, Robert W. |author2=Hall, Roberta L. |volume=13|issue=2| pages=258–67|date=April 1972|doi=10.1086/201274 |jstor=2740977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the working of metals led to the discovery of [[alloys]] such as [[bronze]] and [[brass]] (about 4000 BCE). The first uses of iron alloys such as [[steel]] dates to around 1800 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The significance of the composition of excavated iron fragments taken from Stratum III at the site of Kaman-Kalehöyük, Turkey |journal=Anatolian Archaeological Studies |volume=14 |publisher=Japanese Institute of Anatolian Archaeology |place=Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/001200903261611.htm |title=Ironware piece unearthed from Turkey found to be oldest steel |last= |first= |date=26 March 2009 |work=The Hindu |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329111924/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/001200903261611.htm |archive-date=29 March 2009 |dead-url=yes |access-date=8 November 2016 |via= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, humans were learning to harness other forms of energy.

The ancient [[Sumer]]ians in [[Mesopotamia]] used a complex system of canals and levees to divert water from the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers for irrigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crawford|first=Harriet|date=2013|title=The Sumerian World|location=New York City, New York and London, England|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-203-09660-4|pages=34–43|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qSOYAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=Sumerian+irrigation#v=onepage&amp;q=Sumerian%20irrigation&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to archaeologists, the [[wheel]] was invented around 4000 BCE probably independently and nearly simultaneously in Mesopotamia (in present-day [[Iraq]]), the Northern Caucasus ([[Maykop culture]]) and Central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Companion to the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East|last=Potts|first=D.T.|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=|location=|page=285|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates on when this may have occurred range from 5500 to 3000 BCE with most experts putting it closer to 4000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Light on the Most Ancient East|last=Childe|first=V.

=== Medieval and modern history (300 CE&amp;nbsp;– present) ===
{{Main article|Medieval technology|Renaissance technology|Industrial Revolution|Second Industrial Revolution|Information Technology|Productivity improving technologies (economic history)}}

Innovations continued through the [[Middle Ages]] with innovations such as [[silk]], the [[horse collar]] and [[horseshoe]]s in the first few hundred years after the fall of the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Medieval technology]] saw the use of [[simple machine]]s (such as the [[lever]], the [[screw]], and the [[pulley]]) being combined to form more complicated tools, such as the [[wheelbarrow]], [[windmill]]s and [[clock]]s. The [[Renaissance technology|Renaissance]] brought forth many of these innovations, including the [[printing press]] (which facilitated the greater communication of knowledge), and technology became increasingly associated with [[science]], beginning a cycle of mutual advancement. The advancements in technology in this era allowed a more steady supply of food, followed by the wider availability of consumer goods.

[[File:Late model Ford Model T.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|The [[automobile]] revolutionized personal transportation.]]
Starting in the United Kingdom in the 18th century, the [[Industrial Revolution]] was a period of great technological discovery, particularly in the areas of [[British Agricultural Revolution|agriculture]], [[manufacturing]], [[mining]], [[metallurgy]], and [[transport]], driven by the discovery of [[steam power]]. Technology took another step in a [[second industrial revolution]] with the harnessing of [[electricity]] to create such innovations as the [[electric motor]], [[light bulb]], and countless others. Scientific advancement and the discovery of new concepts later allowed for [[flight|powered flight]] and advancements in [[medicine]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], and [[engineering]]. The rise in technology has led to [[skyscraper]]s and broad [[urban area]]s whose inhabitants rely on [[motor]]s to transport them and their food supply. Communication was also greatly improved with the invention of the [[telegraph]], [[telephone]], [[radio]] and [[television]]. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a revolution in transportation with the invention of the [[airplane]] and [[automobile]].

[[File:USAF F-16A F-15C F-15E Desert Storm edit2.jpg|thumb|[[F-15]] and [[F-16]] flying over [[Kuwaiti oil fires]] during the [[Gulf War]] in 1991.]]
The 20th century brought a host of innovations. In [[physics]], the discovery of [[nuclear fission]] has led to both [[nuclear weapons]] and [[nuclear power]]. [[Computers]] were also invented and later [[miniaturization|miniaturized]] utilizing [[transistor]]s and [[integrated circuit]]s. [[Information technology]] subsequently led to the creation of the [[Internet]], which ushered in the current [[Information Age]]. Humans have also been able to [[space exploration|explore space]] with [[satellite]]s (later used for [[telecommunication]]) and in manned missions going all the way to the moon. In medicine, this era brought innovations such as [[Cardiac surgery|open-heart surgery]] and later [[stem cell treatments|stem cell therapy]] along with new [[pharmaceutical drug|medications]] and treatments.

Complex [[manufacturing]] and [[construction]] techniques and organizations are needed to make and maintain these new technologies, and entire [[industry|industries]] have arisen to support and develop succeeding generations of increasingly more complex tools. Modern technology increasingly relies on training and education&amp;nbsp;– their designers, builders, maintainers, and users often require sophisticated general and specific training. Moreover, these technologies have become so complex that entire fields have been created to support them, including [[engineering]], [[medicine]], and [[computer science]], and other fields have been made more complex, such as [[construction]], [[transportation]], and [[architecture]].

==Philosophy==
===Technicism===
Generally, technicism is the belief in the utility of technology for improving human societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collins English Dictionary|last=|first=|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2011|isbn=978-0-00-743786-3|editor-last=Breslin|editor-first=Gerry|location=|pages=|chapter=technicism|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taken to an extreme, technicism "reflects a fundamental attitude which seeks to control reality, to resolve all problems with the use of scientific–technological methods and tools."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Philosophical and Ethical Problems of Technicism and Genetic Engineering|journal=Society for Philosophy and Technology|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, human beings will someday be able to master all problems and possibly even control the future using technology. Some, such as Stephen V. Monsma,&lt;ref name="Monsma 1986"&gt;{{cite book| last = Monsma | first = Stephen V.| publisher = W.B. Eerdmans Pub. Co|location= [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]]| title = Responsible Technology | year= 1986| isbn = 978-0-8028-0175-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; connect these ideas to the abdication of religion as a higher [[moral authority]].

===Optimism===
{{See also|Extropianism}}
Optimistic assumptions are made by proponents of ideologies such as [[transhumanism]] and [[singularitarianism]], which view [[technological evolution|technological development]] as generally having beneficial effects for the society and the human condition. In these ideologies, technological development is morally good.

Transhumanists generally believe that the point of technology is to overcome barriers, and that what we commonly refer to as the [[human condition]] is just another barrier to be surpassed.

Singularitarians believe in some sort of "[[accelerating change]]"; that the rate of technological progress accelerates as we obtain more technology, and that this will culminate in a "[[Technological singularity|Singularity]]" after [[artificial general intelligence]] is invented in which progress is nearly infinite; hence the term. Estimates for the date of this Singularity vary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://intelligence.org/ie-faq/#WhenWillTheSingularity|title=Intelligence Explosion FAQ|last=Muehlhauser|first=Luke|date=10 November 2015|website=|publisher=[[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]]|access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but prominent futurist [[Ray Kurzweil]] estimates the Singularity will occur in 2045.

Kurzweil is also known for his history of the universe in six epochs: (1) the physical/chemical epoch, (2) the life epoch, (3) the human/brain epoch, (4) the technology epoch, (5) the artificial intelligence epoch, and (6) the universal colonization epoch. Going from one epoch to the next is a Singularity in its own right, and a period of speeding up precedes it. Each epoch takes a shorter time, which means the whole history of the universe is one giant Singularity event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|publisher=Penguin|year=2005|isbn=978-1-101-21888-4|location=|pages=|chapter=The Six Epochs|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics see these ideologies as examples of [[scientism]] and [[techno-utopianism]] and fear the notion of [[human enhancement]] and [[technological singularity]] which they support. Some have described [[Karl Marx]] as a techno-optimist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.changesurfer.com/Acad/DemocraticTranshumanism.htm|title=Democratic Transhumanism 2.0|last=Hughes|first=James|date=|website=Changesurfer|publisher=|access-date=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skepticism and critics===
{{See also|Luddite|Neo-Luddism|Anarcho-primitivism|Bioconservatism}}
[[File:FrameBreaking-1812.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Refer to caption|[[Luddites]] smashing a power loom in 1812]]
On the somewhat skeptical side are certain philosophers like [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[John Zerzan]], who believe that technological societies are inherently flawed. They suggest that the inevitable result of such a society is to become evermore technological at the cost of freedom and psychological health.

Many, such as the [[Luddites]] and prominent philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]], hold serious, although not entirely, deterministic reservations about technology (see "[[The Question Concerning Technology]]"&lt;ref name="Heidegger 1977"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lovitt | first = William | chapter = The Question Concerning Technology | year= 1977 | chapter-url = http://www.culturaleconomics.atfreeweb.com/Anno/Heidegger%20The%20Question%201954.htm | accessdate=21 November 2007 | title = The Question Concerning Technology and Other Essays | publisher = Harper Torchbooks | pages = 3–35 | isbn = 978-0-613-91314-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;). According to Heidegger scholars [[Hubert Dreyfus]] and Charles Spinosa, "Heidegger does not oppose technology. He hopes to reveal the essence of technology in a way that 'in no way confines us to a stultified compulsion to push on blindly with technology or, what comes to the same thing, to rebel helplessly against it.' Indeed, he promises that 'when we once open ourselves expressly to the essence of technology, we find ourselves unexpectedly taken into a freeing claim.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Question Concerning Technology and Other Essays|last=Heidegger|first=Martin|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1977|isbn=|location=New York|pages=25–26|translator-last=Lovitt|translator-first=W.|chapter=The Question Concerning Technology|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; What this entails is a more complex relationship to technology than either techno-optimists or techno-pessimists tend to allow."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophical Romanticism|last=Dreyfus|first=Hubert|last2=Spinosa|first2=Charles|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=|editor-last=Kompridis|editor-first=Nikolas|location=New York|pages=265–81|chapter=Further Reflections on Heidegger, Technology, and the Everyday|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most poignant criticisms of technology are found in what are now considered to be dystopian literary classics such as [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'', [[Anthony Burgess]]'s ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', and [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. In [[Goethe's Faust|Goethe's ''Faust'']], Faust selling his soul to the devil in return for power over the physical world is also often interpreted as a metaphor for the adoption of industrial technology. More recently, modern works of science fiction such as those by [[Philip K. Dick]] and [[William Gibson]] and films such as ''[[Blade Runner]]'' and ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' project highly ambivalent or cautionary attitudes toward technology's impact on human society and identity.

The late cultural critic [[Neil Postman]] distinguished tool-using societies from technological societies and from what he called "technopolies," societies that are dominated by the ideology of technological and scientific progress to the exclusion or harm of other cultural practices, values, and world-views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology|last=Postman|first=Neil|publisher=Vintage|year=1993|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Darin Barney]] has written about technology's impact on practices of [[citizenship]] and democratic culture, suggesting that technology can be construed as (1) an object of political debate, (2) a means or medium of discussion, and (3) a setting for democratic deliberation and citizenship. As a setting for democratic culture, Barney suggests that technology tends to make [[ethics|ethical]] questions, including the question of what a good life consists in, nearly impossible because they already give an answer to the question: a good life is one that includes the use of more and more technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=One Nation Under Google|last=Barney|first=Darin|publisher=House of Anansi Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=Toronto|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikolas Kompridis]] has also [http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia08/parrhesia08_kompridis.pdf written] about the dangers of new technology, such as [[genetic engineering]], [[nanotechnology]], [[synthetic biology]], and [[robotics]]. He warns that these technologies introduce unprecedented new challenges to human beings, including the possibility of the permanent alteration of our biological nature. These concerns are shared by other philosophers, scientists and public intellectuals who have written about similar issues (e.g. [[Francis Fukuyama]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Bill Joy|William Joy]], and [[Michael Sandel]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Technology's Challenge to Democracy|journal=Parrhesia|volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another prominent critic of technology is [[Hubert Dreyfus]], who has published books such as ''On the Internet'' and ''What Computers Still Can't Do''.

A more infamous anti-technological treatise is ''[[s:Industrial Society and Its Future|Industrial Society and Its Future]]'', written by the Unabomber [[Ted Kaczynski]] and printed in several major newspapers (and later books) as part of an effort to end his bombing campaign of the techno-industrial infrastructure. There are also subcultures that disapprove of some or most technology, such as self-identified [[off-gridder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Vannini, Phillip, and Jonathan Taggart. "Voluntary simplicity, involuntary complexities, and the pull of remove: The radical ruralities of off-grid lifestyles." Environment and Planning A 45.2 (2013): 295-311.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appropriate technology===
{{See also|Technocriticism|Technorealism}}
The notion of [[appropriate technology]] was developed in the 20th century by thinkers such as [[E.F. Schumacher]] and [[Jacques Ellul]] to describe situations where it was not desirable to use very new technologies or those that required access to some centralized [[infrastructure]] or parts or skills imported from elsewhere. The [[ecovillage]] movement emerged in part due to this concern.

===Optimism and skepticism in the 21st century===
''This section mainly focuses on American concerns even if it can reasonably be generalized to other Western countries. ''

{{Quotation|The inadequate quantity and quality of American jobs is one of the most fundamental economic challenges we face. [...] What's the linkage between technology and this fundamental problem?|Bernstein, Jared|"It’s Not a Skills Gap That’s Holding Wages Down: It’s the Weak
Economy, Among Other Things," in ''[[The American Prospect]]''|October 2014}}

In his article, [[Jared Bernstein]], a Senior Fellow at the [[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbpp.org/jared-bernstein|title=Jared Bernstein|last=|first=|date=2013-09-13|website=|publisher=[[Center for Budget and Policy Priorities]]|access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; questions the widespread idea that [[automation]], and more broadly, technological advances, have mainly contributed to this growing [[labor market]] problem.
His thesis appears to be a third way between optimism and skepticism. Essentially, he stands for a neutral approach of the linkage between technology and American issues concerning [[unemployment]] and declining wages.

He uses two main arguments to defend his point.
First, because of recent technological advances, an increasing number of workers are losing their jobs. Yet, scientific evidence fails to clearly demonstrate that technology has displaced so many workers that it has created more problems than it has solved. Indeed, [[automation]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;threatens repetitive jobs but higher-end jobs are still necessary because they complement technology and manual jobs that "requires flexibility judgment and common sense"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=It's Not a Skills Gap That's Holding Wages Down: It's the Weak Economy, Among Other Things|journal=The American Prospect|volume=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; remain hard to replace with [[machine]]s. Second, studies have not shown clear links between recent technology advances and the wage trends of the last decades.

Therefore, according to Bernstein, instead of focusing on technology and its hypothetical influences on current American increasing unemployment and declining wages, one needs to worry more about "bad policy that fails to offset the imbalances in demand, trade, income, and opportunity."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For people who use both the Internet and mobile devices in excessive quantities it is likely for them to experience [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and over exhaustion as a result of disruptions in their sleeping patterns. Continuous studies have shown that increased [[Body mass index|BMI]] and weight gain are associated with people who spend long hours online and not exercising frequently.&lt;ref&gt;7.Kim JH 2010 ~Kim JH, Lau C, Cheuk K-K, Kan P, Hui HL, Griffiths SM.

Generation M2: Media in the livesof8-to18-year-olds.HenryJKaiserFamilyFoundation.2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been noted that the use of mobile phones whilst driving has increased the occurrence of road accidents — particularly amongst teen drivers. Statistically, teens reportedly have fourfold the number of road traffic incidents as those who are 20 years or older, and a very high percentage of adolescents write (81%) and read (92%) texts while driving.&lt;ref&gt;Kim JH 2010 ~Kim JH, Lau C, Cheuk K-K, Kan P, Hui HL, Griffiths SM. Brief report:predictors of heavy internet use and associations with health promoting and health risk behaviors among Hong Kong university students. J Adolesc. 2010;33(1):215–20.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, mass media and technology have a negative impact on people, on both their mental and physical health.

===Complex technological systems===
[[Thomas P. Hughes]] stated that because technology has been considered as a key way to solve problems, we need to be aware of its complex and varied characters to use it more efficiently.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human-Built World: How to Think About Technology and Culture|last=Hughes|first=Thomas P.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-226-35933-5|location=Chicago|pages=1–11|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is the difference between a [[wheel]] or a [[compass]] and cooking machines such as an [[oven]] or a [[gas stove]]? Can we consider all of them, only a part of them, or none of them as technologies?

Technology is often considered too narrowly; according to Hughes, "Technology is a creative process involving human ingenuity".&lt;ref name="Hughes, Thomas P. 2004"&gt;Hughes, Thomas P. (2004) "Introduction: Complex Technology" (1–11) in "Human-Built World: How to Think About Technology and Culture"&lt;/ref&gt; This definition's emphasis on creativity avoids unbounded definitions that may mistakenly include cooking "technologies," but it also highlights the prominent role of humans and therefore their responsibilities for the use of complex technological systems.

Yet, because technology is everywhere and has dramatically changed landscapes and societies, Hughes argues that [[engineer]]s, [[scientist]]s, and [[Management|managers]] have often believed that they can use technology to shape the world as they want. They have often supposed that technology is easily controllable and this assumption has to be thoroughly questioned.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For instance, [[Evgeny Morozov]] particularly challenges two concepts: "Internet-centrism" and "solutionism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=To Save Everything, Click Here: The Folly of Technological Solutionism|last=Morozov|first=Evgeny|publisher=PublicAffairs|year=2013|isbn=978-1-61039-139-9|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet-centrism refers to the idea that our society is convinced that the Internet is one of the most stable and coherent forces. Solutionism is the ideology that every social issue can be solved thanks to technology and especially thanks to the internet. In fact, technology intrinsically contains uncertainties and limitations. According to [[Alexis Madrigal]]'s review of Morozov's theory, to ignore it will lead to "unexpected consequences that could eventually cause more damage than the problems they seek to address."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/03/toward-a-complex-realistic-and-moral-tech-criticism/273996/|title=Toward a Complex, Realistic, and Moral Tech Criticism|last=Madrigal|first=Alexis C.|date=13 March 2013|work=The Atlantic|access-date=11 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin R. Cohen and Gwen Ottinger also discussed the multivalent effects of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Benjamin |last1=Cohen |first2=Gwen |last2=Ottinger |editor-first1=Gwen |editor-last1=Ottinger |editor-first2=Benjamin |editor-last2=Cohen| chapter=Introduction: Environmental Justice and the Transformation of Science and Engineering |date=2011 |pages=1–18 |title=Technoscience and Environmental Justice: Expert Cultures in a Grassroots Movement |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=978-0-262-01579-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, recognition of the limitations of technology, and more broadly, scientific knowledge, is needed&amp;nbsp;– especially in cases dealing with [[environmental justice]] and health issues. Ottinger continues this reasoning and argues that the ongoing recognition of the limitations of scientific knowledge goes hand in hand with scientists and engineers’ new comprehension of their role. Such an approach of technology and science "[require] technical professionals to conceive of their roles in the process differently. [They have to consider themselves as] collaborators in research and problem solving rather than simply providers of information and technical solutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Gwen |last1= Ottinger |editor-first1=Gwen |editor-last1=Ottinger |editor-first2=Benjamin |editor-last2=Cohen |title=Technoscience and Environmental Justice: Expert Cultures in a Grassroots Movement |date=2011 |pages=229–48 |chapter=Rupturing Engineering Education: Opportunities for Transforming Expert Identities Through Community-Based Projects |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=978-0-262-01579-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competitiveness==
Technology is properly defined as any application of science to accomplish a function. The science can be leading edge or well established and the function can have high visibility or be significantly more mundane, but it is all technology, and its exploitation is the foundation of all competitive advantage.

Technology-based planning is what was used to build the US industrial giants before WWII (e.g., [[Dow Chemical Company|Dow]], [[DuPont]], [[General Motors|GM]]) and it is what was used to transform the US into a [[superpower]]. It was not economic-based planning.

==Future technology==
{{main article|Emerging technologies}}

[[Theories of technology]] often attempt to predict the future of technology based on the [[high technology]] and science of the time. As with all predictions of the future, however, technology's is uncertain.

In 2005, futurist [[Ray Kurzweil]] predicted that the future of technology would mainly consist of an overlapping "GNR Revolution" of [[genetics]], [[nanotechnology]] and [[robotics]], with robotics being the most important of the three.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Singularity is Near|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|publisher=Penguin|year=2005|isbn=978-1-101-21888-4|location=|pages=|chapter=GNR: Three Overlapping Revolutions|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hypothetical technology ==
Potential technology of the future includes:

[[Hypothetical technology]] &amp;ndash; 
* [[Femtotechnology]] &amp;ndash; hypothetical term used in reference to structuring of matter on the scale of a femtometer, which is 10−15 m. This is a smaller scale in comparison to nanotechnology and picotechnology which refer to 10−9 m and 10−12 m respectively. Work in the femtometer range involves manipulation of excited energy states within atomic nuclei (see nuclear isomer) to produce metastable (or otherwise stabilized) states with unusual properties.

'''Technology readiness levels''' ('''TRL''') are a method of estimating [[technology maturity]] of Critical Technology Elements (CTE) of a program during the acquisition process. They are determined during a Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) that examines program concepts, technology requirements, and demonstrated technology capabilities.  TRL are based on a scale from 1 to 9 with 9 being the most mature technology. The use of TRLs enables consistent, uniform discussions of technical maturity across different types of technology. TRL has been in widespread use at [[NASA]] since the 1980s where it was originally invented&lt;ref name="NASA to EU" /&gt;. In 1999 the [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] was advised by [[Government Accountability Office|GAO]] to use the scale for procurement which it did from the early 2000s.  By 2008 the scale was also in use at the [[European Space Agency|European Space Agency (ESA)]] as it is evidenced by their [https://artes.esa.int/sites/default/files/TRL_Handbook.pdf handbook]. The [[European Commission]] advised EU-funded research and innovation projects to adopt the scale in 2010&lt;ref name="NASA to EU" /&gt; which they did from 2014 in its [https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/ Horizon 2020] [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|program]]. In 2013 TRL was further canonized by the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 16290:2013 standard&lt;ref name="NASA to EU" /&gt;. A comprehensive approach and discussion about TRLs has been published by the European Association of Research and Technology Organisations ([http://www.earto.eu/ EARTO]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earto.eu/fileadmin/content/03_Publications/The_TRL_Scale_as_a_R_I_Policy_Tool_-_EARTO_Recommendations_-_Final.pdf The TRL scale as a Research &amp; Innovation Policy Tool]&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive criticism of the adoption of TRL scale by the European Union was published in The Innovation Journal, in that "concreteness and sophistication of the TRL scale gradually diminished as its usage spread outside its original context (space programs)".&lt;ref name="NASA to EU" /&gt;

==History==

Technology Readiness Levels were originally conceived at NASA in 1974 and formally defined in 1989. The original definition included seven levels, but in the 1990s NASA adopted the current nine-level scale that subsequently gained widespread acceptance.&lt;ref name="TRL Demystified"&gt;{{cite web|title = Technology Readiness Levels Demystified|author=Banke, Jim |date = 20 August 2010 |url = http://www.nasa.gov/topics/aeronautics/features/trl_demystified.html|publisher = [[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Original NASA TRL Definitions (1989)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Sadin, Stanley R.|author2 = Povinelli, Frederick P.|author3 = Rosen, Robert |title = ''The NASA technology push towards future space mission systems'', presented at the IAF, International Astronautical Congress, 39th, Bangalore, India, Oct. 8-15, 1988 |date = October 1, 1988|url = https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?print=yes&amp;R=19890030268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Level 1 – Basic Principles Observed and Reported
:Level 2 – Potential Application Validated
:Level 3 – Proof-of-Concept Demonstrated, Analytically and/or Experimentally
:Level 4 – Component and/or [[Breadboard]] Laboratory Validated
:Level 5 – Component and/or Breadboard Validated in Simulated or Realspace Environment
:Level 6 – System Adequacy Validated in Simulated Environment
:Level 7 – System Adequacy Validated in Space

The TRL methodology was originated by Stan Sadin at NASA Headquarters in 1974.&lt;ref name="TRL Demystified"/&gt; At that time, Ray Chase was the JPL Propulsion Division representative on the Jupiter Orbiter design team. At the suggestion of Stan Sadin, Mr Chase used this methodology to assess the technology readiness of the proposed JPL Jupiter Orbiter spacecraft design.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Later Mr Chase spent a year at NASA Headquarters helping Mr Sadin institutionalize the TRL methodology. Mr Chase joined ANSER in 1978, where he used the TRL methodology to evaluate the technology readiness of proposed Air Force development programs. He published several articles during the 1980s and 90s on reusable launch vehicles utilizing the TRL methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Chase, R.L.|title = ''Methodology for Assessing Technological and Manufacturing Readiness of NASP-Technology Enabled Vehicles (AIAA 91-2389)'', presented at the 27th Joint Propulsion Conference, June 24-26, 1991, Sacramento CA |date = 26 June 1991|url = http://papers.sae.org/965565/}}&lt;/ref&gt; These documented an expanded version of the methodology that included design tools, test facilities, and manufacturing readiness on the Air Force Have Not program.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The Have Not program manager, Greg Jenkins, and Ray Chase published the expanded version of the TRL methodology, which included design and manufacturing.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Leon McKinney and Mr Chase used the expanded version to assess the technology readiness of the ANSER team's Highly Reusable Space Transportation ("HRST") concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|display-authors = 4|author = R.

The [[United States Air Force]] adopted the use of Technology Readiness Levels in the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

In 1995, [[John C. Mankins]], NASA, wrote a paper that discussed NASA's use of TRL, extended the scale, and proposed expanded descriptions for each TRL.&lt;ref name="NASA to EU" /&gt; In 1999, the United States [[General Accounting Office]] produced an influential report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Best Practices: Better Management of Technology Can Improve Weapon System Outcomes (GAO/NSIAD-99-162)|date = July 1999 |url = http://www.gao.gov/archive/1999/ns991620.pdf|publisher = [[General Accounting Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; that examined the differences in [[technology transfer|technology transition]] between the DOD and private industry. It concluded that the DOD takes greater risks and attempts to transition emerging technologies at lesser degrees of maturity than does private industry. The GAO concluded that use of immature technology increased overall program risk. The GAO recommended that the DOD make wider use of Technology Readiness Levels as a means of assessing technology maturity prior to transition. In 2001, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Science and Technology issued a memorandum that endorsed use of TRLs in new major programs. Guidance for assessing technology maturity was incorporated into the ''Defense Acquisition Guidebook''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://at.dod.mil/docs/DefenseAcquisitionGuidebook.pdf ''Defense Acquisition Guidebook''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425232741/http://at.dod.mil/docs/DefenseAcquisitionGuidebook.pdf |date=2012-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the DOD developed detailed guidance for using TRLs in the 2003 DOD Technology Readiness Assessment Deskbook.

===In the European Union ===
The European Space Agency&lt;ref name="NASA to EU"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mihaly|first=Heder|date=September 2017|title=From NASA to EU: the evolution of the TRL scale in Public Sector Innovation|url=https://www.innovation.cc/discussion-papers/22_2_3_heder_nasa-to-eu-trl-scale.pdf|journal=The Innovation Journal|volume=22|pages=1–23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011071816/https://www.innovation.cc/discussion-papers/22_2_3_heder_nasa-to-eu-trl-scale.pdf|archive-date=October 11, 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; adopted the TRL scale in the mid-2000s. Its handbook&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology Readiness Levels Handbook For Space Applications|last=|first=|publisher=European Space Agency|year=2008|isbn=|location=https://artes.esa.int/sites/default/files/TRL_Handbook.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; closely follows the NASA definition of TRLs. The universal usage of TRL in EU policy was proposed in the final report of the first High Level Expert Group on Key Enabling Technologies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/DocsRoom/documents/11283/attachments/1/translations/en/renditions/native|title=High-Level Expert Group on Key Enabling Technologies - Final Report|last=|first=|date=2011|website=|access-date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was indeed implemented in the subsequent EU framework program, called H2020, running from 2013 to 2020.&lt;ref name="NASA to EU" /&gt; This means not only space and weapons programs, but everything from nanotechnology to informatics and communication technology.

==Assessment tools==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:TPMM Process Icon.jpg]] --&gt;[[Image:TPMM transition mech.jpg|right|300px|TPMM Transition Mechanism]]

A ''Technology Readiness Level Calculator'' was developed by the [[United States Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Nolte, William L.|title = ''Technology Readiness Level Calculator, Air Force Research Laboratory'', presented at the NDIA Systems Engineering Conference |date = 20 October 2003|url = http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2003systems/nolte.ppt|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tool is a standard set of questions implemented in [[Microsoft Excel]] that produces a graphical display of the TRLs achieved. This tool is intended to provide a snapshot of technology maturity at a given point in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Technology Assessment Calculator|url = https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=320594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Technology Program Management Model'' was developed by the [[United States Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Craver, Jeffrey T.|title = ''Technology Program Management Model, Army Space and Missile Defense Command Technical Center'', presented at the NDIA Systems Engineering Conference |date = 26 October 2006|url = http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2006systems/Thursday/crave.pdf|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TPMM is a TRL-gated high-fidelity activity model that provides a flexible management tool to assist Technology Managers in planning, managing, and assessing their technologies for successful technology transition.  The model provides a core set of activities including [[systems engineering]] and [[program management]] tasks that are tailored to the technology development and management goals.  This approach is comprehensive, yet it consolidates the complex activities that are relevant to the development and transition of a specific technology program into one integrated model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ''TPMM - Technology Program Management Model'' (only available to DOD components)|url = https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=148163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

The primary purpose of using technology readiness levels is to help management in making decisions concerning the development and transitioning of technology. It should be viewed as one of several tools that are needed to manage the progress of research and development activity within an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Christophe Deutsch|author2 = Chiara Meneghini|author3 = Ozzy Mermut|author4 = Martin Lefort|title = Measuring Technology Readiness to improve Innovation Management|accessdate = 2011-11-27|url = http://www.ino.ca/Docs/Documents/publications/scientifiques/Deutch_Measuring%20technology%20readiness%20to%20improve%20innovation%20management.pdf|publisher = INO|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120602044401/http://www.ino.ca/Docs/Documents/publications/scientifiques/Deutch_Measuring%20technology%20readiness%20to%20improve%20innovation%20management.pdf|archivedate = 2012-06-02|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the advantages of TRLs:&lt;ref name="hfidtc"&gt;{{cite web|author = Ben Dawson|title = The Impact of Technology Insertion on Organisations|date = 31 October 2007|url = http://www.hfidtc.com/research/process/reports/phase-2/HFIDTC-2-12-2-1-1-tech-organisation.pdf|publisher = Human Factors Integration Design Technology Centre|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120426001612/http://www.hfidtc.com/research/process/reports/phase-2/HFIDTC-2-12-2-1-1-tech-organisation.pdf|archivedate = 26 April 2012|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Provides a common understanding of technology status
* Risk management
* Used to make decisions concerning technology funding
* Used to make decisions concerning transition of technology

Some of the characteristics of TRLs that limit their utility:&lt;ref name ="hfidtc" /&gt;

* Readiness does not necessarily fit with appropriateness or technology maturity
* A mature product may possess a greater or lesser degree of readiness for use in a particular system context than one of lower maturity
* Numerous factors must be considered, including the relevance of the products' operational environment to the system at hand, as well as the product-system architectural mismatch

Current TRL models tend to disregard negative and obsolescence factors. There have been suggestions made for incorporating such factors into assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Ricardo Valerdi|author2 = Ron J. Kohl|title = ''An Approach to Technology Risk Management'', Engineering Systems Division Symposium MIT, Cambridge, MA, March 29-31, 2004 |date = March 2004|url = http://web.mit.edu/rvalerdi/www/TRL%20paper%20ESD%20Valerdi%20Kohl.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For complex technologies that incorporate various development stages, a more detailed scheme called the Technology Readiness Pathway Matrix has been developed going from basic units to applications in society. This tool aims to show that a readiness level of a technology is based on a less linear process but on a more complex pathway through its application in society.. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Vincent Jamier|author2 = Christophe Aucher|title = ''Demystifying Technology Readiness Levels for Complex Technologies'', Leitat, Barcelona, April 24, 2018 |date = April 2018|url = https://projects.leitat.org/demystifying-trls-for-complex-technologies/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multimodal anthropology''' is an emerging subfield of social [[cultural anthropology]] that encompasses anthropological research and knowledge production across multiple traditional and new media platforms and practices including [[film]], [[video]], [[photography]], theatre, design, [[podcast]], mobile apps, interactive games, web-based social networking, immersive [[360-degree video|360 video]] and [[augmented reality]]. As characterized in [[American Anthropologist]]'','' multimodal anthropology is an "anthropology that works across multiple media, but one that also engages in public anthropology and collaborative anthropology through a field of differentially linked media platforms" (Collins, Durington &amp; Gill).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=Samuel Gerald|last2=Durington|first2=Matthew|last3=Gill|first3=Harjant|date=2017-01-12|title=Multimodality: An Invitation|journal=American Anthropologist|language=en|volume=119|issue=1|pages=142–146|doi=10.1111/aman.12826|issn=0002-7294}}&lt;/ref&gt; A multimodal approach also encourages [[anthropologist]] to reconsider the ways in which they conduct their research, to pay close attention to the role various media technologies and digital devices plays in the lives of their interlocutors, and how they these technologies redefine what fieldwork looks like.

== History and background ==
Multimodal anthropology is not a new concept. It has been a fundamental part of anthropological research and [[Field research|fieldwork]] from the early days of the disciple. Anthropologists have been experimenting with different forms media technologies throughout the [[20th century|twentieth century]] whenever confronted with the limitation of text-based ethnography. Multimodal is a term that has readily been used since the 1970s in varied disciplines as [[psychotherapy]], [[phonetics]], [[genetics]], [[literature]] and [[medicine]] to characterize different approaches to carrying out scientific research that involves to a certain degree, thinking outside of the box. In the early 1990s, semioticians used the terms to discuss different forms of communication across different media, eventually including digital media.

Technological advances in the later part of the twentieth century, the accessibility to [[photography]], [[film]] cameras and audio recorders led to the emergence of [[visual anthropology]] as a sub discipline dedicated to the study and production of ethnographic photography, film and media. Building in this legacy, multimodal anthropology seeks to expand the boundaries of visual anthropology to incorporate emerging technologies of [[21st century|twenty-first century]] including mobile networking, [[social media]], [[Geotagging|geo-mapping]], [[virtual reality]], [[Podcast|podcasting]], [[interactive design]], along with other traditional forms of learning and knowledge production like art and drawing that were often sidelined within [[visual anthropology]], such as interactive gaming, theatre, performance, graphic novels, ethnofiction and experimental ethnography. As Samuel Collins, Matthew Durington and [[Harjant Gill]] note in their introductory essay on title "Multimodality: An Invitation," published in [[American Anthropologist]], "multimodal anthropologies does not attempt – or desire – to supplant visual anthropology. Rather it seeks to include traditional forms of [[visual anthropology]] while simultaneously broadening the purview of the discipline to engage in variety of media forms that exist today."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Enchroma lenses''' are [[glasses]] designed to improve and modify some aspects of color vision deficiency for [[color blind]] people. The glasses were invented by Dr. Donald McPherson in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wweyecenter.com/enchroma/|title=Enchroma Color Vision Eyewear|last=|first=|date=|website=Walla Walla Eye Center|access-date=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wearing the glasses results in subtle differences when color blind people look longer and more carefully.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medgadget.com/2017/10/enchroma-colorblind-glasses-review-illuminating-but-are-they-worth-the-money.html|title=Enchroma Colorblind Glasses Review: Illuminating, But Are They Worth The Money? {{!}}|last=|first=|date=4 October 2017|work=Medgadget|access-date=29 November 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
[[Glass Science|Glass scientist]] Dr. Donald McPherson invented Enchroma glasses by accident. He originally invented this type of lens to protect surgeons during laser operations. In 2002 at the [[Ultimate Frisbee]] tournament in [[Santa Cruz, California]] McPherson lent a pair to a friend who was [[color blind]]. His friend saw colors he had never seen before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/business/enchromas-accidental-spectacles-find-niche-among-the-colorblind.html/| title=EnChroma's accidental spectacles find niche among the colorblind|last=Martin|first=Claire|date=15 August 2015|newspaper=The New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; McPherson started studying color blindness, and with Andrew Schmeder founded the company EnChroma Inc. in 2010 to sell glasses that compensate for color vision deficiency. Enchroma glasses target people with difficulties in distinguishing reds and greens. The first pair of commercial glasses were released in 2012.

== Technology ==
===Optical filters===
[[File:Posey County Courthouse composite.jpg|325x325px|The upper picture shows an ordinary scene taken through an ordinary lens, while the lower shows the same scene taken through an EnChroma lens|alt=|thumb]]
The [[optical filter]] used in Enchroma lenses can improve or modify aspects of [[color vision deficiency]] (CVD). Enchroma lenses focus on the most common color vision deficiency which is caused by the red and green [[retinal cone]] cells that, when responding to light, coincide. The most common form of color blindness is known as deuteranomaly, it is genetic and an [[X-linked trait]] that affects up to one in every 12 men (8%) and one in 200 women (0.5%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brilleye.com/services/color-blindness/|title=Color Blind Glasses - EnChroma Lenses for Color Blindness|last=Brill Eye Center|first=|date=26 July 2018|website=|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To eliminate the overlapping of the [[wavelengths]] of light, there is an optical material called a 'multi-notch' filter, is capable of removing the exact wavelengths of light in the location where it overlaps, getting a simplified differentiation of colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US6149270A/en|title=Optical filters affecting color vision in a desired manner and design method thereof by non-linear optimization|last1=Hayashi|first=Masashi|date=21 November 2000|website=Google Patents|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://phys.org/news/2018-10-scientists-debunk-effectiveness-enchroma-glasses.html|title=Scientists debunk the effectiveness of EnChroma glasses for colorblind people|last=University of Granada|first=|date=29 October 2018|website=Phys.org|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The glasses block specific wavelengths to create a clearer separation of different color signals so that they can be better calculated by the brain. The separation of signals allows most people with CVD to distinguish colors, but the glasses will have little to no effect on the 20% of color blind people who have severe color impairment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/can-these-glasses-help-the-colorblind-we-put-en-chroma-1739433668|title=Can These Glasses Help the Colorblind? We Put EnChroma to the Test|last=Diane|first=Kelly|date=11 July 2015|work=Gizmodo|access-date=29 November 2018|last2=Maddie|first2=Stone|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://cen.acs.org/articles/95/i6/Experimenting-EnChromas-color-blind-assistance.html|title=Experimenting with EnChroma’s color-blind assistance glasses|last=Bettenhausen|first=Craig|date=6 February 2017|website=Chemical &amp; Engineering News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 November 2018|volume=95|issue=6|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The filters designed by the method have a [[visible spectrum|spectral]] transmittance that can be essentially described as a multi-band filter, made up by a plurality of [[passband]]s interleaved with [[stopband]]s. This technology makes it possible to remove the overlapping of colours.

===Lens material===

The use of glass in lens manufacturing has reduced due to the availability of new lens materials offering different characteristics. Lens research is aimed at finding the optimum materials for the most common vision deficiencies. Enchroma technology is one of the few materials to compenste for CVD. [[Corrective_lens#Trivex|Trivex]] eyeglass lenses were first developed by [[PPG Industries|PPG industries]] in the United States. The lenses can be progressive or photochromic. They are significant in allowing better vision sharpness and eye protection, and are also comfortable to wear since the weight of the material is minimized. The tinted plastic lens used to make enchroma glasses is coated in approximtely 100 layers of [[dielectric material]].  A coating can be applied on both sides of the lens to eliminate light reflection and to protect the lens itself for scratches. A predecessor of the Trivex lens with similar characteristics is made from [[polycarbonate]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thevisioncouncil.org/content/lens-materials/adults|title=Lens Materials|last=|first=|date=|website=The Vision Council|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products incorporating Enchroma lenses ==
Enchroma lenses are used in various types of glasses, including sunglasses, indoor glasses, infant, industrial safety and sports glasses.

===Sunglasses===
Sunglasses were the first product to use Enchroma lenses. They can be used in various lighting conditions, even in bright indoor environments, and assist people affected by deuteranopia and protanopia. They protect those who are affected by color blindness from solar ultraviolet and blue light and do not let [[Solar Radiation|solar radiation]] with a [[wavelength]] shorter than 450 nanometers pass through. They block just one or two colors (usually green and blue), permitting people to see colors such as dull brown or yellow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/41ac42e42783bf4d4e7692441e8324a9/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=2029739|title=In Brief: Finishing leader marks 40 years of success|last=|first=|date=March 2013|website=Optometry Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to a specific coat that increases the brightness of colors and provides protection from UV rays.  

Different models of sunglasses exist, according to the color deficiency the person suffers from.

===Indoor glasses===
This version of the glasses for people with CVD can be used indoors, but they work best in bright lighting and have applications for people who spend a lot of time facing a computer monitor. 
Students with color blindness can have a benefit from the glasses, because they can understand particular color-coded information better at their school or at university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brilleye.com/services/color-blindness/|title=Are Enchroma lenses available in prescription?|last=Brill Eye Center|first=|date=26 July 2018|website=Brill Eye Center|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children, industrial safety and sports glasses===
There are also particular glasses for athletic people, for children and for industrial safety use which are made of particular materials such as polycarbonate.  This makes the glasses stronger and less breakable. These kind of lenses are able to correct severe vision deficiency but they do not need additional lens thickness to achieve this. Trivex eyeglass lenses offer the same characteristics as those that are made for athletic people or children and provide an alternative material to polycarbonate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Medical uses==
The glasses are available in single vision lenses, [[bifocals]], and [[progressive lens]]. The sunglasses are also used by some [[Old_age#Senior_citizen|senior citizens]] to help with [[Photophobia|sunlight sensitivity]] or due to medical conditions such as [[diabetes]], [[glaucoma]], [[macular degeneration]], [[cataracts]], [[multiple sclerosis]], and [[eye neoplasm|eye cancer]].{{cn|date=January 2019}}

== University experiments ==
===Pacific University and Qassim University ===
The [[Qassim University]] and the [[Pacific University]] conducted joint experiments.

The Qassim University experiment involved 25 males aged from 20 to 25 years. Two of those 25 were excluded because of a vision disease that may affect the CVD deficiency.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://commons.pacificu.edu/opt/21|title=Assessment of Enchroma Filter for Correcting Color Vision Deficiency|last=Almutairi, Nawaf; Kundart, James; Muthuramalingam, Naganathan; Hayes, John; Citek, Karl; and Aljohani, Saad|first=|date=2017|website=Pacific University|access-date=24 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pacific University]] College of Optometry's experiment tested whether the glasses helped people with particular deficiencies improve the way they see colors. The study involved ten individuals with [[Heredity|hereditary]] deficiencies (nine males and one female from age 19 to 52).&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

The Enchroma Cx-14 filters did not significantly influence the vision of CVD subjects but, for two of them, the error score was improved.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== University of Granada ===
In 2018, researchers from the [[University of Granada]] studied Enchroma lenses and proved that they merely helped color blind people to see the same colors in a different way since the colored filter altered the way colors appeared in their eyes.

The research involved 200 volunteers, including 48 who were color blind people. Out of the 48, four were women and 44 were men, aged between 14 and 64. These participants were already aware of their own condition of CVD. The study concluded that, although an improvement in color vision has been accomplished since the colors are enhanced by the effect of the glasses, the technology could not be considered completely effective because the color vision it offers ws not identical to the non-colour blind individuals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the glasses, the color vision of the participants was evaluated without the Enchroma glasses using the [[Ishihara test]], [[Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test]], and a color-naming test (with 21 colors from an [[ColorChecker|X-Rite GretagMacbeth Chart]]). The tests were repeated under the same conditions while wearing Enchroma glasses. In order to measure the full effect of Enchroma lenses, an adaptation time of 30 minutes was given to the participants. Between the two sections of the tests, more than 2 weeks passed in order to reduce the likelihood of participants memorizing the color patterns.

The researchers claimed that the effect of using Enchroma glasses is similar to glasses where the use of color filters changes the user’s perception and increases the contrast among the colors, such as those used for shooting or hunting. The research showed that Enchroma glasses did not reveal any improvement in the Ishihara test and Farnsworth Munsell 100 hue test.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gómez-Robledo|first=L.|last2=Valero|first2=E. M.|last3=Huertas|first3=R.|last4=Martínez-Domingo|first4=M. A.|last5=Hernández-Andrés|first5=J.|date=29 October 2018|title=Do EnChroma glasses improve color vision for colorblind subjects?|url=|journal=Optics Express|volume=26|issue=22|pages=28693|doi=10.1364/oe.26.028693|issn=1094-4087|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other research on the effects of wearing Enchroma glasses on red-green CVD, R. Mastey recruited 27 males: eight [[deuteranomaly|deuteranomalous]], ten [[deuteranope|deuteranopic]] and nine [[protanope|protanopic]], while E. J. Patterson recruited fifteen males: seven deuteranopic, six deuteranomalous, one protanomalous and one protanopic. For the research, the researchers used the Color Assessment and Diagnosis (CAD) test that provides chromatic discrimination thresholds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hernández-Andrés|first=J.|last2=Martínez-Domingo|first2=M. A.|last3=Huertas|first3=R.|last4=Valero|first4=E. M.|last5=Gómez-Robledo|first5=L.|date=2018-10-29|title=Do EnChroma glasses improve color vision for colorblind subjects?|url=https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-26-22-28693|journal=Optics Express|language=EN|volume=26|issue=22|pages=28693–28703|doi=10.1364/OE.26.028693|issn=1094-4087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University of Otago ===
In 2015 Dr. Blake Porter of the [[University of Otago]] conducted an experiment with 406 participants, of whom 42 already used Enchroma glasses.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.blakeporterneuro.com/color-vision-efficacy-enchroma-glasses/|title=Color vision, color blindness, and Enchroma glasses' efficacy - An internet sourced survey on what color means. 10.13140/RG.2.1.2531.4642.|last=Porter|first=Blake|date=27 November 2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participants were asked questions about their color blindness, their personal experience with the lens and the effects of those on their life and on the way they saw the colors.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

90% of the participants said they would recommend them to other people, and more than 50% of those people stated that enchroma glasses improved their life. 10% of the remaining participants reported that the glasses did not have any impact on their life. 40% of the participants identified green as the color range that changed the most.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

In some subjects, improvements due to the technology do not happen immediately because the brain requires time to rewire and create new links, [[neuroplasticity]]. Neuroplasticity depends on the age of the individual. Younger people reported that they perceived little changes from the first time they wore glasses and a second wearing in which they have had time to adapt to the technology. Middle age people reported that the colors continued to change from the first time they wore the lens, and that color brightness and enhancement got better with time. Most participants related that the biggest effects of the glasses are not perceived initially but after a few days, confirming that the neuroplasticity takes time.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

The experiment demonstrated that the glasses have a positive effect on the everyday life of those subject to color blindness. The glasses achieve better results with some colors than others. The biggest improvements are achieved with greens, followed by purples, pinks, and reds.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Subtle differences emerged when users looked longer and more carefully.

[[Modern science]] is typically divided into three major [[Branches of science|branches]] that consist of the [[natural science]]s (e.g., [[biology]], [[chemistry]], and [[physics]]), which study nature in the broadest sense; the [[social science]]s (e.g., [[economics]], [[psychology]], and [[sociology]]), which study individuals and societies; and the [[formal science]]s (e.g., [[logic]], [[mathematics]], and [[theoretical computer science]]), which study abstract concepts.

Science is based on [[research]], which is commonly conducted in [[Academic institution|academic]] and [[research institute|research institutions]] as well as in [[Government agency|government agencies]] and [[Company|companies]]. The practical impact of scientific research has led to the emergence of [[science policy|science policies]] that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by prioritizing the development of [[Product (business)|commercial products]], [[weapon|armaments]], [[health care]], and [[environmental protection]].

== History ==
{{Main|History of science}}
Science in a broad sense existed before the [[modern era]] and in many historical [[civilization]]s.&lt;ref name = Grant1997&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grant|first1=Edward|title=History of Science: When Did Modern Science Begin?|journal=The American Scholar|date=1 January 1997|volume=66|issue=1|pages=105–113|jstor=41212592}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Modern science]] is distinct in its [[Science#Scientific practice|approach]] and successful in its [[science#Literature|results]], so it now defines what science is in the strictest sense of the term.&lt;ref name="Heilbron 2003 p. vii"&gt;{{harvnb|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|"The historian&amp;nbsp;... requires a very broad definition of "science"&amp;nbsp;– one that&amp;nbsp;... will help us to understand the modern scientific enterprise. We need to be broad and inclusive, rather than narrow and exclusive&amp;nbsp;... and we should expect that the farther back we go [in time] the broader we will need to be." &amp;nbsp;— {{harv|Lindberg|2007|p=3}}, which further cites {{cite journal|last1=Pingree|first1=David|author-link=David Pingree|title=Hellenophilia versus the History of Science|journal=Isis|date=December 1992|volume=4|issue=4|pages=554–63|jstor=234257|doi=10.1086/356288|bibcode=1992Isis...83..554P}}}} Science in its original sense was a word for a type of knowledge, rather than a specialized word for the pursuit of such knowledge. In particular, it was the type of knowledge which people can communicate to each other and share. For example, knowledge about the working of natural things was gathered long before recorded history and led to the development of complex abstract thought. This is shown by the construction of complex calendars, techniques for making poisonous plants edible, [[public works]] at national scale, such as those which harnessed the [[floodplain]] of the [[Yangtse]] with reservoirs,&lt;ref&gt;[[Sima Qian]] (司馬遷, d. 86 BCE) in his ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (太史公書) covering some 2500 years of Chinese history, records [[Sunshu Ao]] (孫叔敖, fl. c. 630–595 BCE – [[Zhou dynasty]]), the first known [[hydraulic engineer]] of China, cited in ([[Joseph Needham]] et.al (1971) ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]'' '''4.3''' p. 271) as having built a reservoir which has lasted to this day.&lt;/ref&gt; dams, and dikes, and buildings such as the Pyramids. However, no consistent conscious distinction was made between knowledge of such things, which are true in every community, and other types of communal knowledge, such as mythologies and legal systems. [[Metallurgy]] was known in prehistory, and the [[Vinča culture]] was the earliest known producer of bronze-like alloys. It is thought that early experimentation with heating and mixing of substances over time developed into [[alchemy]].

A turning point in the history of early philosophical science was [[Socrates]]' example of applying philosophy to the study of human matters, including human nature, the nature of political communities, and human knowledge itself. The [[Socratic method]] as documented by [[Plato]]'s dialogues is a [[dialectic]] method of hypothesis elimination: better hypotheses are found by steadily identifying and eliminating those that lead to contradictions. This was a reaction to the [[Sophist]] emphasis on [[rhetoric]]. The Socratic method searches for general, commonly held truths that shape beliefs and scrutinizes them to determine their consistency with other beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DApol.%3Apage%3D17 |title=Plato, Apology| page= 17 |accessdate=2017-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129145253/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DApol.%3Apage%3D17 |archivedate=January 29, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates criticized the older type of study of physics as too purely speculative and lacking in self-criticism.

[[Aristotle]] later created a systematic programme of [[teleological]] philosophy: Motion and change is described as the actualization of potentials already in things, according to what types of things they are. In his physics, the Sun goes around the Earth, and many things have it as part of their nature that they are for humans. Each thing has a [[formal cause]], a [[final cause]], and a role in a cosmic order with an [[unmoved mover]]. The Socratics also insisted that philosophy should be used to consider the practical question of the best way to live for a human being (a study Aristotle divided into [[ethics]] and [[political philosophy]]). Aristotle maintained that man knows a thing scientifically "when he possesses a conviction arrived at in a certain way, and when the first principles on which that conviction rests are known to him with certainty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Aristotle|title=Nicomachean Ethics|edition=H.

Because of the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] due to the [[Migration Period]] an intellectual decline took place in the western part of Europe in the 400s. In contrast, the [[Byzantine Empire]] resisted the attacks from the barbarians, and preserved and improved upon the learning. [[John Philoponus]], a Byzantine scholar in the 500s, was the first scholar ever to question Aristotle's teaching of physics and to note its flaws. John Philoponus' criticism of Aristotelian principles of physics served as an inspiration to medieval scholars as well as to Galileo Galilei who ten centuries later, during the [[Scientific Revolution]], extensively cited Philoponus in his works while making the case as to why Aristotelian physics was flawed.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David.

During [[late antiquity]] and the [[early Middle Ages]], the Aristotelian approach to inquiries on natural phenomena was used.

However, the general fields of science (or "[[natural philosophy]]" as it was called) and much of the general knowledge from the ancient world remained preserved through the works of the early Latin encyclopedists like [[Isidore of Seville]].&lt;ref name=Grant1996&gt;{{cite book | title=The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages: Their Religious, Institutional and Intellectual Contexts | series=Cambridge Studies in the History of Science | first1=Edward | last1=Grant | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1996 | isbn=0521567629 | pages=7–17 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YyvmEyX6rZgC }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aristotle's original texts were eventually lost in Western Europe, and only one text by Plato was widely known, the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', which was the only Platonic dialogue, and one of the few original works of classical natural philosophy, available to Latin readers in the early Middle Ages.

By the eleventh century most of Europe had become Christian; stronger monarchies emerged; borders were restored; technological developments and agricultural innovations were made which increased the food supply and population.

The influx of ancient texts caused the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]] and the flourishing of a synthesis of [[Catholicism]] and [[Aristotelianism]] known as [[Scholasticism]] in [[western Europe]], which became a new geographic center of science. An ''experiment'' in this period would be understood as a careful process of observing, describing, and classifying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Albertus-Magnus |title=St. Albertus Magnus &amp;#124; German theologian, scientist, and philosopher |accessdate=2017-10-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028045424/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Albertus-Magnus |archivedate=October 28, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One prominent scientist in this era was [[Roger Bacon]]. Scholasticism had a strong focus on revelation and [[dialectic|dialectic reasoning]], and gradually fell out of favour over the next centuries, as [[alchemy]]'s focus on experiments that include direct observation and meticulous documentation slowly increased in importance.

=== Renaissance and early modern science ===
{{Main|Scientific Revolution}}
[[File:Tycho instrument sextant mounting 19.jpg|thumb|right|[[Astronomy]] became more [[accurate]] after [[Tycho Brahe]] devised his [[Measuring instrument|scientific instruments]] for measuring angles between two [[celestial body|celestial bodies]], before the invention of the telescope. [[Tycho's observational astronomy|Brahe's observations]] were the basis for [[Kepler's laws]].]]
Alhazen disproved Ptolemy's theory of vision,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2001}}{{rp|Book I, [6.54]. p. 372}}&lt;/ref&gt; but did not make any corresponding changes to Aristotle's metaphysics. The scientific revolution ran concurrently to a process where elements of Aristotle's metaphysics such as ethics, teleology and formal causality slowly fell out of favour. Scholars slowly came to realize that the universe itself might well be devoid of both purpose and ethical imperatives. The development from a physics infused with goals, ethics, and spirit, toward a physics where these elements do not play an integral role, took centuries. This development was enhanced by the [[Condemnations of 1210–1277|Condemnations of 1277]], where Aristotle's books were banned by the [[Catholic church]]. This allowed the theoretical possibility of vacuum and motion in a vacuum. A direct result was the emergence of the science of [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]].

New developments in optics played a role in the inception of the [[Renaissance]], both by challenging long-held metaphysical ideas on perception, as well as by contributing to the improvement and development of technology such as the [[camera obscura]] and the [[telescope]]. Before what we now know as the Renaissance started, [[Roger Bacon]], [[Vitello]], and [[John Peckham]] each built up a scholastic ontology upon a causal chain beginning with sensation, perception, and finally apperception of the individual and universal [[theory of forms|forms]] of Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 3657358|title = Alhacen's Theory of Visual Perception: A Critical Edition, with English Translation and Commentary, of the First Three Books of Alhacen's "De aspectibus", the Medieval Latin Version of Ibn al-Haytham's "Kitāb al-Manāẓir": Volume One|journal = Transactions of the American Philosophical Society|volume = 91|issue = 4|pages = i–337|last1 = Smith|first1 = A.

In the sixteenth century, [[Copernicus]] formulated a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model of the solar system unlike the [[geocentric model]] of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]''. This was based on a theorem that the [[orbital period]]s of the planets are longer as their orbs are farther from the centre of motion, which he found not to agree with Ptolemy's model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1177/002182860203300301|title = Copernicus and the Origin of his Heliocentric System|journal = Journal for the History of Astronomy|volume = 33|issue = 3|pages = 219–35|year = 2016|last1 = Goldstein|first1 = Bernard R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] and others challenged the notion that the only function of the eye is perception, and shifted the main focus in optics from the eye to the propagation of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1086/352843|title = Getting the Big Picture in Perspectivist Optics|journal = Isis|volume = 72|issue = 4|pages = 568–89|year = 1981|last1 = Smith|first1 = A.

Kepler was driven to this experiment after observing the partial solar eclipse at Graz, July 10, 1600. He used Tycho Brahe's method of observation, which was to project the image of the Sun on a piece of paper through a pinhole aperture, instead of looking directly at the Sun. He disagreed with Brahe's conclusion that total eclipses of the Sun were impossible, because there were historical accounts of total eclipses. Instead he deduced that the size of the aperture controls the sharpness of the projected image (the larger the aperture, the more accurate the image&amp;nbsp;– this fact is now fundamental for optical system design). Voelkel, p. 61, notes that Kepler's experiments produced the first correct account of vision and the eye, because he realized he could not accurately write about astronomical observation by ignoring the eye.}} Kepler is best known, however, for improving Copernicus' heliocentric model through the discovery of [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]]. Kepler did not reject Aristotelian metaphysics, and described his work as a search for the [[Musica universalis|Harmony of the Spheres]].

[[Galileo]] made innovative use of experiment and mathematics. However, he became persecuted after Pope Urban VIII blessed Galileo to write about the Copernican system. Galileo had used arguments from the Pope and put them in the voice of the simpleton in the work "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems", which greatly offended Urban VIII.&lt;ref name="Pope Urban VIII"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/gal/urban.html|title=Pope Urban VIII|last=van Helden|first=Al|date=1995|website=The Galileo Project|publisher=|access-date=November 3, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111033150/http://galileo.rice.edu/gal/urban.html|archivedate=November 11, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Northern Europe, the new technology of the [[printing press]] was widely used to publish many arguments, including some that disagreed widely with contemporary ideas of nature. [[René Descartes]] and [[Francis Bacon]] published philosophical arguments in favor of a new type of non-Aristotelian science. Descartes emphasized individual thought and argued that mathematics rather than geometry should be used in order to study nature. Bacon emphasized the importance of experiment over contemplation. Bacon further questioned the Aristotelian concepts of formal cause and final cause, and promoted the idea that science should study the laws of "simple" natures, such as heat, rather than assuming that there is any specific nature, or "[[formal cause]]", of each complex type of thing. This new science began to see itself as describing "[[Physical law|laws of nature]]". This updated approach to studies in nature was seen as [[mechanistic]]. Bacon also argued that science should aim for the first time at practical inventions for the improvement of all human life.

=== Age of Enlightenment ===
{{Main|Age of Enlightenment}}
[[File:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|left|[[Isaac Newton]], shown here in a 1689 portrait, made seminal contributions to [[classical mechanics]], [[gravity]], and [[optics]]. Newton shares credit with [[Gottfried Leibniz]] for the development of calculus.]]
As a precursor to the [[Age of Enlightenment]], [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] succeeded in developing a new physics, now referred to as [[classical mechanics]], which could be confirmed by experiment and explained using mathematics. Leibniz also incorporated terms from [[Aristotelian physics]], but now being used in a new non-teleological way, for example, "[[energy]]" and "[[potential]]" (modern versions of Aristotelian "[[actuality and potentiality|''energeia'' and ''potentia'']]"). This implied a shift in the view of objects: Where Aristotle had noted that objects have certain innate goals that can be actualized, objects were now regarded as devoid of innate goals. In the style of Francis Bacon, Leibniz assumed that different types of things all work according to the same general laws of nature, with no special formal or final causes for each type of thing. It is during this period that the word "science" gradually became more commonly used to refer to a ''type of pursuit'' of a type of knowledge, especially knowledge of nature&amp;nbsp;– coming close in meaning to the old term "[[natural philosophy]]."

During this time, the declared purpose and value of science became producing wealth and [[invention]]s that would improve human lives, in the [[Economic materialism|materialistic]] sense of having more food, clothing, and other things.  In [[Novum Organum|Bacon's words]], "the real and legitimate goal of sciences is the endowment of human life with new inventions and riches", and he discouraged scientists from pursuing intangible philosophical or spiritual ideas, which he believed contributed little to human happiness beyond "the fume of subtle, sublime, or pleasing speculation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgmbZIybuRoC&amp;pg=PA162|title=The Social and Economic Roots of the Scientific Revolution: Texts by Boris Hessen and Henryk Grossmann|last=Freudenthal|first=Gideon|last2=McLaughlin|first2=Peter|date=2009-05-20|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781402096044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science during the Enlightenment was dominated by scientific societies and [[Academy|academies]], which had largely replaced universities as centres of scientific research and development. Societies and academies were also the backbone of the maturation of the scientific profession. Another important development was the [[popular culture|popularization]] of science among an increasingly literate population. [[Philosophe]]s introduced the public to many scientific theories, most notably through the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' and the popularization of [[Newtonianism]] by [[Voltaire]] as well as by Émilie du Châtelet, the French translator of Newton's ''Principia''.

Some historians have marked the 18th century as a drab period in the [[history of science]];&lt;ref&gt;see Hall (1954), iii; Mason (1956), 223.&lt;/ref&gt; however, the century saw significant advancements in the practice of [[medicine]], [[mathematics]], and [[physics]]; the development of biological [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]; a new understanding of [[magnetism]] and [[electricity]]; and the maturation of [[chemistry]] as a discipline, which established the foundations of modern chemistry.

[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers chose a short history of scientific predecessors&amp;nbsp;– Galileo, Boyle, and Newton principally&amp;nbsp;– as the guides and guarantors of their applications of the singular concept of [[nature]] and [[natural law]] to every physical and social field of the day. In this respect, the lessons of history and the social structures built upon it could be discarded.&lt;ref&gt;Cassels, Alan. Ideology and International Relations in the Modern World. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 19th century ===
[[File:Charles Darwin seated crop.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.80|[[Charles Darwin]] in 1854, by then working towards publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]].'']]
The nineteenth century is a particularly important period in the history of science since during this era many distinguishing characteristics of contemporary modern science began to take shape such as: transformation of the life and physical sciences, frequent use of precision instruments, emergence of terms like "biologist", "physicist", "scientist"; slowly moving away from antiquated labels like "natural philosophy" and "natural history", increased professionalization of those studying nature lead to reduction in amateur naturalists, scientists gained cultural authority over many dimensions of society, economic expansion and industrialization of numerous countries, thriving of popular science writings and emergence of science journals.&lt;ref name="Lightman 19th"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lightman|first1=Bernard|editor1-last=Shank|editor1-first=Michael|editor2-last=Numbers|editor2-first=Ronald|editor3-last=Harrison|editor3-first=Peter|title=Wrestling with Nature : From Omens to Science|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226317830|page=367|chapter=13. Science and the Public}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the 19th century, [[John Dalton]] suggested the modern [[atomic theory]], based on [[Democritus]]'s original idea of individible particles called ''atoms''.
[[File:Candle-light-animated.gif|thumb|left|upright=0.80|Combustion and chemical reactions were studied by [[Michael Faraday]] and reported in his lectures before the [[Royal Institution]]: ''[[The Chemical History of a Candle]]'', 1861.]]
Both [[John Herschel]] and [[William Whewell]] systematized methodology: the latter coined the term [[scientist]].&lt;ref name="Whewell scientist"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=1962|title=Scientist: The story of a word|url=http://www.informaworld.com/index/739364907.pdf|format=PDF|journal=[[Annals of Science]]|volume=18|issue=2|pages=65–85|doi=10.1080/00033796200202722|ref=harv|author=Ross, Sydney|accessdate=2011-03-08}} To be exact, the person who coined the term ''scientist'' was referred to in Whewell 1834 only as "some ingenious gentleman." Ross added a comment that this "some ingenious gentleman" was Whewell himself, without giving the reason for the identification. Ross 1962, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' he established [[evolution]] as the prevailing explanation of biological complexity. His theory of [[natural selection]] provided a natural explanation of how [[species]] originated, but this only gained wide acceptance a century later.

The laws of [[conservation of energy]], [[conservation of momentum]] and [[conservation of mass]] suggested a highly stable universe where there could be little loss of resources. With the advent of the steam engine and the [[industrial revolution]], there was, however, an increased understanding that all forms of energy as defined by Newton were not equally useful; they did not have the same [[energy quality]]. This realization led to the development of the laws of [[thermodynamics]], in which the cumulative energy quality of the universe is seen as constantly declining: the [[entropy]] of the universe increases over time.

The [[electromagnetic theory]] was also established in the 19th century, and raised new questions which could not easily be answered using Newton's framework. The phenomena that would allow the deconstruction of the [[atom]] were discovered in the last decade of the 19th century: the discovery of [[X-ray]]s inspired the discovery of [[radioactivity]]. In the next year came the discovery of the first subatomic particle, the [[electron]].

=== 20th century ===
[[File:ADN animation.gif|thumb|right|The [[DNA]] [[double helix]] is a [[molecule]] that encodes the [[genetics|genetic]] instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living [[organism]]s and many [[virus]]es.]]
[[Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]] and the development of [[quantum mechanics]] led to the replacement of classical mechanics with a new physics which contains two parts that describe different types of events in nature.

In the first half of the century, the development of [[antibiotics]] and [[artificial fertilizer]] made global human [[population growth]] possible. At the same time, the structure of the atom and its nucleus was discovered, leading to the release of "[[atomic energy]]" ([[nuclear power]]). In addition, the extensive use of technological innovation stimulated by the wars of this century led to revolutions in transportation ([[automobile]]s and [[aircraft]]), the development of [[ICBM]]s, a [[space race]], and a [[nuclear arms race]].

The molecular structure of [[DNA]] was discovered in 1953. The discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] in 1964 led to a rejection of the [[Steady State theory]] of the universe in favour of the [[Big Bang]] theory of [[Georges Lemaître]].

The development of [[spaceflight]] in the second half of the century allowed the first astronomical measurements done on or near other objects in space, including [[Apollo program|manned landings on the Moon]]. [[Space telescope]]s lead to numerous discoveries in astronomy and cosmology.

Widespread use of [[integrated circuit]]s in the last quarter of the 20th century combined with [[communications satellite]]s led to a revolution in [[information technology]] and the rise of the global [[internet]] and [[mobile computing]], including [[smartphone]]s. The need for mass systematization of long, intertwined causal chains and large amounts of data led to the rise of the fields of [[systems theory]] and computer-assisted [[scientific modelling]], which are partly based on the Aristotelian paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/255139|jstor=255139|title=The History and Status of General Systems Theory|journal=The Academy of Management Journal|volume=15|issue=4|pages=407–26|last1=von Bertalanffy|first1=Ludwig|year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harmful [[environmental issue]]s such as [[ozone depletion]], [[Acidification (disambiguation)|acidification]], [[eutrophication]] and [[climate change]] came to the public's attention in the same period, and caused the onset of [[environmental science]] and [[environmental technology]]. In a 1967 article, [[Lynn Townsend White Jr.]] blamed the ecological crisis on the historical decline of the notion of spirit in nature.&lt;ref&gt;White, L., 1967, ''The historical roots of our ecologic crisis''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Natural science]] is concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of [[Phenomenon|natural phenomena]] based on [[empirical evidence]] from [[observation]] and [[experimentation]]. It can be divided into two main branches: [[list of life sciences|life science]] (or biological science) and [[Outline of physical science|physical science]]. Physical science is subdivided into branches, including [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[astronomy]] and [[earth science]]. These two branches may be further divided into more specialized disciplines. Modern natural science is the successor to the [[natural philosophy]] that began in [[Ancient Greece]]. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] debated the benefits of using approaches which were more [[mathematical physics|mathematical]] and more experimental in a methodical way.

[[File:Supply-demand-right-shift-demand.svg|thumb|right|In [[economics]], the [[supply and demand]] model describes how prices vary as a result of a balance between product availability and demand.]]
[[Social science]] is concerned with [[society]] and the [[Social relation|relationships]] among [[individuals]] within a society. It has many branches that include, but are not limited to, [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], [[communication studies]], [[economics]], [[history]], [[human geography]], [[jurisprudence]], [[linguistics]], [[political science]], [[psychology]], [[public health]], and [[sociology]]. Social scientists may adopt various [[philosophical theories]] to study individuals and society. For example, [[Positivism|positivist]] social scientists use methods resembling those of the [[natural science]]s as tools for understanding society, and so define science in its stricter [[Modern science|modern sense]]. [[Antipositivism|Interpretivist]] social scientists, by contrast, may use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically [[falsifiable]] theories, and thus treat science in its broader sense. In modern academic practice, researchers are often [[Eclecticism|eclectic]], using multiple [[Methodology|methodologies]] (for instance, by combining both [[quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[qualitative research]]). The term "[[social research]]" has also acquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners from various disciplines share in its aims and methods.

[[File:Shadow Hand Bulb large.jpg|thumb|right|A [[humanoid]] robotic hand (see [[Shadow Hand]] system).]]
[[Formal science]] is involved in the study of [[formal systems]]. It includes [[mathematics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tomalin, Marcus |year=2006 |title=Linguistics and the Formal Sciences |doi=10.2277/0521854814}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Formal Sciences: Their Scope, Their Foundations, and Their Unity|journal=Synthese|volume=133 |pages=5–11| doi=10.1023/a:1020887832028|year=2002|last1=Löwe|first1=Benedikt}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[systems theory]], [[robotics]], and [[theoretical computer science]]. The formal sciences share similarities with the other two branches by relying on objective, careful, and systematic study of an area of knowledge. They are, however, different from the empirical sciences as they rely exclusively on deductive reasoning, without the need for [[empirical evidence]], to verify their abstract concepts.&lt;ref name="Fetzer2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bill2007"&gt;{{Citation |first=Thompson | last = Bill |title=The Nature of Statistical Evidence |chapter=2.4 Formal Science and Applied Mathematics |publisher=Springer |series=Lecture Notes in Statistics |volume=189 |edition=1st |year=2007 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Popper|2002|pp=10–11}} The formal sciences are therefore [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] disciplines and because of this, there is disagreement on whether they actually constitute a science.&lt;ref name="Bishop1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bunge 1998"/&gt; Nevertheless, the formal sciences play an important role in the empirical sciences.

== Scientific research ==
{{See also|Research}}
Scientific research can be labeled as either basic or applied research. Basic research is the search for knowledge and applied research is the search for solutions to practical problems using this knowledge. Although some scientific research is [[applied research]] into specific problems, a great deal of our understanding comes from the curiosity-driven undertaking of [[basic research]]. This leads to options for technological advance that were not planned or sometimes even imaginable. This point was made by Michael Faraday when allegedly in response to the question "what is the ''use'' of basic research?" he responded: "Sir, what is the use of a new-born child?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richarddawkins.net/articles/91|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119113522/http://richarddawkins.net/articles/91|archivedate=January 19, 2012 |title=To Live at All Is Miracle Enough|author= Richard Dawkins |publisher=RichardDawkins.net |date=May 10, 2006 |accessdate=February 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, research into the effects of red light on the human eye's [[rod cell]]s did not seem to have any practical purpose; eventually, the discovery that our [[night vision]] is not troubled by red light would lead [[search and rescue]] teams (among others) to adopt red light in the cockpits of jets and helicopters.&lt;ref name="Stanovich2007" /&gt;{{rp|106–10}} Finally, even basic research can take unexpected turns, and there is some sense in which the scientific method is built to [[Scientific method#Luck and science|harness luck]].

=== Scientific method ===
{{Main|Scientific method}}
[[File:IRAS 10082-5647.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|The central star IRAS 10082-5647 was captured by the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].]]
Scientific research involves using the [[scientific method]], which seeks to [[objectivity (science)|objectively]] explain the events of [[nature]] in a [[reproducible]] way.{{efn|{{harvnb|di Francia|1976|p=13}}: "The amazing point is that for the first time since the discovery of mathematics, a method has been introduced, the results of which have an intersubjective value!" ''(Author's punctuation)''}} An explanatory [[thought experiment]] or [[hypothesis]] is put forward as explanation using principles such as parsimony (also known as "[[Occam's Razor]]") and are generally expected to seek [[consilience]]&amp;nbsp;– fitting well with other accepted facts related to the phenomena.&lt;ref name=EOWilson&gt;{{cite book| last = Wilson | first = Edward | title = Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge | publisher = Vintage | location = New York | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-679-76867-8| ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; This new explanation is used to make [[falsifiable]] predictions that are testable by experiment or observation. The predictions are to be posted before a confirming experiment or observation is sought, as proof that no tampering has occurred. Disproof of a prediction is evidence of progress.{{efn|{{harvnb|di Francia|1976|pp=4–5}}: "One learns in a laboratory; one learns how to make experiments only by experimenting, and one learns how to work with his hands only by using them. The first and fundamental form of experimentation in physics is to teach young people to work with their hands. Then they should be taken into a laboratory and taught to work with measuring instruments&amp;nbsp;– each student carrying out real experiments in physics. This form of teaching is indispensable and cannot be read in a book."}}{{efn|{{harvnb|Fara|2009|p=204}}: "Whatever their discipline, scientists claimed to share a common scientific method that&amp;nbsp;... distinguished them from non-scientists."}} This is done partly through observation of natural phenomena, but also through experimentation that tries to simulate natural events under controlled conditions as appropriate to the discipline (in the observational sciences, such as astronomy or geology, a predicted observation might take the place of a controlled experiment). Experimentation is especially important in science to help establish [[causality|causal relationships]] (to avoid the [[correlation does not imply causation|correlation fallacy]]).

When a hypothesis proves unsatisfactory, it is either modified or discarded.{{sfn|Nola|Irzik|2005|p=208}} If the hypothesis survived testing, it may become adopted into the framework of a [[scientific theory]], a logically reasoned, self-consistent model or framework for describing the behavior of certain natural phenomena. A theory typically describes the behavior of much broader sets of phenomena than a hypothesis; commonly, a large number of hypotheses can be logically bound together by a single theory. Thus a theory is a hypothesis explaining various other hypotheses. In that vein, theories are formulated according to most of the same scientific principles as hypotheses. In addition to testing hypotheses, scientists may also generate a [[Scientific modelling|model]], an attempt to describe or depict the phenomenon in terms of a logical, physical or mathematical representation and to generate new hypotheses that can be tested, based on observable phenomena.{{sfn|Nola|Irzik|2005|pp=199–201}}

While performing experiments to test hypotheses, scientists may have a preference for one outcome over another, and so it is important to ensure that science as a whole can eliminate this bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=van Gelder | first=Tim | year=1999 | url=http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/tgelder/papers/HeadsIWin.pdf | format=PDF | title="Heads I win, tails you lose": A Foray Into the Psychology of Philosophy | publisher=University of Melbourne | accessdate=March 28, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409054240/http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/tgelder/papers/HeadsIWin.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = April 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Pease | first=Craig | date=September 6, 2006 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619154617/http://law-and-science.net/Science4BLJ/Scientific_Method/Deliberate.bias/Text.htm | archivedate = June 19, 2010 | title=Chapter 23.

==== Role of mathematics ====
{{Main|Mathematics|Formal science}}
[[File:Integral as region under curve.svg|thumb|right|Calculus, the mathematics of continuous change, underpins many of the sciences.]]

[[Mathematics]] is essential in the formation of [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]], [[Theory|theories]], and [[physical law|laws]]{{sfn|Popper|2002|pp=79–82}} in the [[Natural science|natural]] and [[Social science|social]] sciences. For example, it is used in quantitative [[Scientific modelling|scientific modeling]], which can generate new hypotheses and predictions to be tested. It is also used extensively in observing and collecting [[measurements]]. [[Statistics]], a branch of mathematics, is used to summarize and analyze data, which allow scientists to assess the reliability and variability of their experimental results.

[[Computational science]] applies computing power to [[Simulation#Computer simulation|simulate]] real-world situations, enabling a better understanding of scientific problems than formal mathematics alone can achieve. According to the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]], computation is now as important as theory and experiment in advancing scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siam.org/students/resources/report.php|title=SIAM: Graduate Education for Computational Science and Engineering|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics|access-date=November 4, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228083134/https://www.siam.org/students/resources/report.php|archivedate=December 28, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Verifiability ====
[[John Ziman]] points out that [[intersubjective verifiability]] is fundamental to the creation of all scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Ziman cites {{harvnb|Polanyi|1958}} chapter 12, as referenced in {{harvnb|Ziman|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}} Ziman shows how scientists can identify patterns to each other across centuries; he refers to this ability as "perceptual consensibility."&lt;ref name=Ziman1978&gt;{{harvnb|Ziman|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46}} He then makes consensibility, leading to consensus, the touchstone of reliable knowledge.&lt;ref name=Ziman1978 /&gt;{{rp|104}}

=== Philosophy of science ===
{{See also|Philosophy of science}}
[[File:JohnLocke.png|thumb|English philosopher and physician [[John Locke]] (1632–1704), a leading philosopher of British empiricism]]
Scientists usually take for granted a set of basic assumptions that are needed to justify the scientific method: (1) that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers; (2) that this objective reality is governed by natural laws; (3) that these laws can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation.&lt;ref name="Heilbron 2003 p. vii" /&gt; Philosophy of science seeks a deep understanding of what these underlying assumptions mean and whether they are valid.

The belief that scientific theories should and do represent [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] reality is known as [[Scientific realism|realism]]. It can be contrasted with [[Anti-realism#Anti-realism in science|anti-realism]], the view that the success of science does not depend on it being accurate about unobservable entities such as [[electrons]]. One form of anti-realism is [[idealism]], the belief that the mind or [[consciousness]] is the most basic essence, and that each mind generates its own reality.{{efn|This realization is the topic of [[intersubjective verifiability]], as recounted, for example, by [[Max Born]] (1949, 1965) [https://archive.org/stream/naturalphilosoph032159mbp/naturalphilosoph032159mbp_djvu.txt ''Natural Philosophy of Cause and Chance''], who points out that all knowledge, including natural or social science, is also subjective. p. 162: "Thus it dawned upon me that fundamentally everything is subjective, everything without exception. That was a shock."}} In an idealistic [[world view]], what is true for one mind need not be true for other minds.

There are different schools of thought in philosophy of science. The most popular position is [[empiricism]],{{efn|name=Galileo1638|In his investigation of the [[law of falling bodies]], [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] (1638) serves as example for scientific investigation: ''[[Two New Sciences]]'' "A piece of wooden moulding or scantling, about 12 cubits long, half a cubit wide, and three finger-breadths thick, was taken; on its edge was cut a channel a little more than one finger in breadth; having made this groove very straight, smooth, and polished, and having lined it with parchment, also as smooth and polished as possible, we rolled along it a hard, smooth, and very round bronze ball. Having placed this board in a sloping position, by lifting one end some one or two cubits above the other, we rolled the ball, as I was just saying, along the channel, noting, in a manner presently to be described, the time required to make the descent. We ... now rolled the ball only one-quarter the length of the channel; and having measured the time of its descent, we found it precisely one-half of the former. Next we tried other distances, comparing the time for the whole length with that for the half, or with that for two-thirds, or three-fourths, or indeed for any fraction; in such experiments, repeated many, many, times." Galileo solved the problem of time measurement by weighing a jet of water collected during the descent of the bronze ball, as stated in his ''Two New Sciences''.}} which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation and that scientific theories are the result of generalizations from such observations.&lt;ref&gt;"...&amp;nbsp;[T]he logical empiricists thought that the great aim of science was to discover and establish ''generalizations''."&amp;nbsp;—{{harvnb| Godfrey-Smith|2003|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empiricism generally encompasses [[inductivism]], a position that tries to explain the way general theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans can make and hence the finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm scientific theories. This is necessary because the number of predictions those theories make is infinite, which means that they cannot be known from the finite amount of evidence using [[deductive logic]] only. Many versions of empiricism exist, with the predominant ones being [[Bayesianism]]{{Sfn|Godfrey-Smith|2003|p=203}} and the [[hypothetico-deductive method]].&lt;ref name="Godfrey-Smith,2003"&gt;{{harvnb| Godfrey-Smith|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|236}}

[[File:Karl Popper2.jpg|left|thumb|The Austrian-British philosopher of science Karl Popper (1902–1994) in 1990. He is best known for his work on [[falsifiability|empirical falsification]].]]
Empiricism has stood in contrast to [[rationalism]], the position originally associated with [[Descartes]], which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect, not by observation.&lt;ref name="Godfrey-Smith,2003" /&gt;{{rp|20}} [[Critical rationalism]] is a contrasting 20th-century approach to science, first defined by Austrian-British philosopher [[Karl Popper]]. Popper rejected the way that empiricism describes the connection between theory and observation. He claimed that theories are not generated by observation, but that observation is made in the light of theories and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when it comes in conflict with it.&lt;ref name="Godfrey-Smith,2003" /&gt;{{rp|63–67}} Popper proposed replacing verifiability with [[falsifiability]] as the landmark of scientific theories and replacing induction with [[Falsificationism|falsification]] as the empirical method.&lt;ref name="Godfrey-Smith,2003" /&gt;{{rp|68}} Popper further claimed that there is actually only one universal method, not specific to science: the negative method of criticism, [[trial and error]].&lt;ref&gt;Popper called this ''Conjecture and Refutation.'' {{harvnb| Godfrey-Smith|2003|pp=117–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It covers all products of the human mind, including science, mathematics, philosophy, and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Objective Knowledge|last=Popper|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1972|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach, [[instrumentalism]], colloquially termed "shut up and multiply,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Shut_up_and_multiply|title=Shut up and multiply|last=|first=|date=September 13, 2015|website=LessWrong Wiki|publisher=|access-date=November 4, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019082101/https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Shut_up_and_multiply|archivedate=October 19, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizes the utility of theories as instruments for explaining and predicting phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Rationality of Science | author = Newton-Smith, W.H. | location = London | publisher = Routledge | year = 1994 | page = 30|isbn = 978-0-7100-0913-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It views scientific theories as black boxes with only their input (initial conditions) and output (predictions) being relevant. Consequences, theoretical entities, and logical structure are claimed to be something that should simply be ignored and that scientists shouldn't make a fuss about (see [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]]). Close to instrumentalism is [[constructive empiricism]], according to which the main criterion for the success of a scientific theory is whether what it says about observable entities is true.

[[Thomas Kuhn]] argued that the process of observation and evaluation takes place within a paradigm, a [[logically consistent]] "portrait" of the world that is consistent with observations made from its framing. He characterized ''normal science'' as the process of observation and "puzzle solving" which takes place within a paradigm, whereas ''revolutionary science'' occurs when one paradigm overtakes another in a [[paradigm shift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2013/entries/thomas-kuhn/ |title = Thomas Kuhn |accessdate = 2015-10-26 |last = Bird |first = Alexander |year = 2013 |website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor1-last=Zalta |editor1-first= Edward N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretations. The choice between paradigms involves setting two or more "portraits" against the world and deciding which likeness is most promising. A paradigm shift occurs when a significant number of observational anomalies arise in the old paradigm and a new paradigm makes sense of them. That is, the choice of a new paradigm is based on observations, even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm. For Kuhn, acceptance or rejection of a paradigm is a social process as much as a logical process. Kuhn's position, however, is not one of [[relativism]].&lt;ref name="KuhnP206"&gt;T.S. Kuhn, ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', 2nd. ed., Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1970, p. 206. {{ISBN|0-226-45804-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, another approach often cited in debates of [[scientific skepticism]] against controversial movements like "[[creation science]]" is [[methodological naturalism]]. Its main point is that a difference between natural and [[supernatural]] explanations should be made and that science should be restricted methodologically to natural explanations.{{efn|{{harvnb| Godfrey-Smith|2003|p=151}} credits [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] (1969) "Epistemology Naturalized" ''Ontological Relativity and Other Essays'' New York: Columbia University Press, as well as [[John Dewey]], with the basic ideas of naturalism&amp;nbsp;– [[Naturalized Epistemology]], but Godfrey-Smith diverges from Quine's position: according to Godfrey-Smith, "A naturalist can think that science can contribute to ''answers'' to philosophical questions, without thinking that philosophical questions can be replaced by science questions.".}} That the restriction is merely methodological (rather than ontological) means that science should not consider supernatural explanations itself, but should not claim them to be wrong either. Instead, supernatural explanations should be left a matter of personal belief [[Non-overlapping magisteria|outside the scope of science]]. Methodological naturalism maintains that proper science requires strict adherence to [[empirical]] study and independent verification as a process for properly developing and evaluating explanations for [[observation|observable]] phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = The Review of Metaphysics|title = Casebeer, William D. Natural Ethical Facts: Evolution, Connectionism, and Moral Cognition|author = Brugger, E. Christian|volume = 58| issue = 2|year = 2004|ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of these standards, [[Appeal to authority|arguments from authority]], biased [[observational studies]] and other common [[fallacy|fallacies]] are frequently cited by supporters of methodological naturalism as characteristic of the [[non-science]] they criticize.

==== Certainty and science ====
A scientific theory is [[empirical]]{{efn|name=Galileo1638}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/structure-scientific-theories/|title=The Structure of Scientific Theories|last=Winther|first=Rasmus Grønfeldt|date=2015|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|access-date=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is always open to [[falsifiability|falsification]] if new evidence is presented. That is, no theory is ever considered strictly [[Certainty|certain]] as science accepts the concept of [[fallibilism]].{{efn|"No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong."&amp;nbsp;—[[Albert Einstein]], noted by Alice Calaprice (ed. 2005) ''The New Quotable Einstein'' Princeton University Press and Hebrew University of Jerusalem, {{ISBN|0-691-12074-9}} p. 291. Calaprice denotes this not as an exact quotation, but as a paraphrase of a translation of A. Einstein's "Induction and Deduction". ''Collected Papers of Albert Einstein'' '''7''' Document 28. Volume 7 is ''The Berlin Years: Writings, 1918–1921''. A. Einstein; M. Janssen, R. Schulmann, et al., eds.}} The philosopher of science [[Karl Popper]] sharply distinguished truth from certainty. He wrote that scientific knowledge "consists in the search for truth," but it "is not the search for certainty&amp;nbsp;... All human knowledge is fallible and therefore uncertain."{{sfn|Popper|1996}}{{rp|4}}

New scientific knowledge rarely results in vast changes in our understanding. According to psychologist [[Keith Stanovich]], it may be the media's overuse of words like "breakthrough" that leads the public to imagine that science is constantly proving everything it thought was true to be false.&lt;ref name="Stanovich2007" /&gt;{{rp|119–38}} While there are such famous cases as the [[theory of relativity]] that required a complete reconceptualization, these are extreme exceptions. Knowledge in science is gained by a gradual synthesis of information from different experiments by various [[research]]ers across different branches of science; it is more like a climb than a leap.&lt;ref name="Stanovich2007" /&gt;{{rp|123}} Theories vary in the extent to which they have been tested and verified, as well as their acceptance in the scientific community.{{efn|{{cite book|last=Fleck|first=Ludwik|authorlink=Ludwik Fleck|editor1-first=Thaddeus J. |editor1-last=Trenn|editor2-first=Robert K |editor2-last=Merton|title=Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact|year=1979|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-25325-1}} Claims that before a specific fact "existed", it had to be created as part of a social agreement within a community. [[Steven Shapin]] (1980) "A view of scientific thought" ''Science'' ccvii (Mar 7, 1980) 1065–66 states "[To Fleck,] facts are invented, not discovered. Moreover, the appearance of scientific facts as discovered things is itself a social construction: a ''made'' thing. "}} For example, [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric theory]], [[evolution|the theory of evolution]], [[relativity theory]], and [[Germ theory of disease|germ theory]] still bear the name "theory" even though, in practice, they are considered [[fact]]ual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/sep/01/schools.research | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=One side can be wrong | first1=Richard | last1=Dawkins | first2=Jerry | last2=Coyne | date=September 2, 2005 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226232200/http://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/sep/01/schools.research | archivedate=December 26, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Philosopher [[Barry Stroud]] adds that, although the best definition for "[[knowledge]]" is contested, being [[skeptical]] and entertaining the ''possibility'' that one is incorrect is compatible with being correct. Therefore, scientists adhering to proper scientific approaches will doubt themselves even once they possess the [[truth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophybites.com/2007/12/barry-stroud-on.html |title=Barry Stroud on Scepticism |publisher=philosophy bites |date=December 16, 2007 |accessdate=February 5, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123175047/http://philosophybites.com/2007/12/barry-stroud-on.html |archivedate=January 23, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[fallibilist]] [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.&amp;nbsp;S.

Stanovich also asserts that science avoids searching for a "magic bullet"; it avoids the [[Fallacy of the single cause|single-cause fallacy]]. This means a scientist would not ask merely "What is ''the'' cause of&amp;nbsp;...", but rather "What ''are'' the most significant ''causes'' of&amp;nbsp;...". This is especially the case in the more macroscopic fields of science (e.g. [[psychology]], [[physical cosmology]]).&lt;ref name="Stanovich2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Stanovich|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|141–47}} [[Research]] often analyzes few factors at once, but these are always added to the long list of factors that are most important to consider.&lt;ref name="Stanovich2007" /&gt;{{rp|141–47}} For example, knowing the details of only a person's genetics, or their history and upbringing, or the current situation may not explain a behavior, but a deep understanding of all these variables combined can be very predictive.

==== Fringe science, pseudoscience, and junk science ====
An area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is sometimes referred to as [[pseudoscience]], [[fringe science]], or [[junk science]].{{efn|"''Pseudoscientific&amp;nbsp;– pretending to be scientific, falsely represented as being scientific''", from the ''Oxford American Dictionary'', published by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]; Hansson, Sven Ove (1996)."Defining Pseudoscience", Philosophia Naturalis, 33: 169–76, as cited in [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/#NonSciPosSci "Science and Pseudo-science"] (2008) in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. The Stanford article states: "Many writers on pseudoscience have emphasized that pseudoscience is non-science posing as science. The foremost modern classic on the subject (Gardner 1957) bears the title [[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]. According to Brian Baigrie (1988, 438), "[w]hat is objectionable about these beliefs is that they masquerade as genuinely scientific ones." These and many other authors assume that to be pseudoscientific, an activity or a teaching has to satisfy the following two criteria (Hansson 1996): (1) it is not scientific, and (2) its major proponents try to create the impression that it is scientific".
* For example, Hewitt et al. ''Conceptual Physical Science'' Addison Wesley; 3 edition (July 18, 2003) {{ISBN|0-321-05173-4}}, Bennett et al. ''The Cosmic Perspective'' 3e Addison Wesley; 3 edition (July 25, 2003) {{ISBN|0-8053-8738-2}}; ''See also'', e.g., Gauch HG Jr. ''Scientific Method in Practice'' (2003).
* A 2006 [[National Science Foundation]] report on Science and engineering indicators quoted [[Michael Shermer]]'s (1997) definition of pseudoscience: '"claims presented so that they appear [to be] scientific even though they lack supporting evidence and plausibility" (p. 33). In contrast, science is "a set of methods designed to describe and interpret observed and inferred phenomena, past or present, and aimed at building a testable body of knowledge open to rejection or confirmation" (p. 17)'.{{cite book|author=Shermer M.|year=1997|title=Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time|location=New York|publisher=W.

* "A pretended or spurious science; a collection of related beliefs about the world mistakenly regarded as being based on scientific method or as having the status that scientific truths now have," from the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', second edition 1989.}} Physicist [[Richard Feynman]] coined the term "[[cargo cult science]]" for cases in which researchers believe they are doing science because their activities have the outward appearance of science but actually lack the "kind of utter honesty" that allows their results to be rigorously evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~ken/cargo_cult.html |title=Cargo Cult Science |last=Feynman |first=Richard |date=1974 |website=Center for Theoretical Neuroscience |publisher=Columbia University |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050304032544/http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~ken/cargo_cult.html |archive-date=March 4, 2005 |dead-url=yes |access-date=November 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various types of commercial advertising, ranging from hype to fraud, may fall into these categories.

There can also be an element of political or ideological bias on all sides of scientific debates. Sometimes, research may be characterized as "bad science," research that may be well-intended but is actually incorrect, obsolete, incomplete, or over-simplified expositions of scientific ideas. The term "[[scientific misconduct]]" refers to situations such as where researchers have intentionally misrepresented their published data or have purposely given credit for a discovery to the wrong person.&lt;ref name=COPE1999PDF&gt;{{cite journal |title=Coping with fraud |journal=The COPE Report 1999 |pages=11–18 |url=http://www.publicationethics.org.uk/reports/1999/1999pdf3.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928151119/http://www.publicationethics.org.uk/reports/1999/1999pdf3.pdf |quote=It is 10 years, to the month, since Stephen Lock&amp;nbsp;...

=== Scientific literature ===
{{Main|Scientific literature}}
[[File:Science Vol. 1 (1880).jpg|thumb|right|Cover of the first volume of the scientific journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 1880.]]
Scientific research is published in an enormous range of [[scientific literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=John Ziman| last=Ziman | first=J.M. | journal=Science | title=The proliferation of scientific literature: a natural process | year=1980 | volume=208 | issue=4442 | pages=369–71 | doi= 10.1126/science.7367863 | pmid=7367863 | ref=harv | bibcode=1980Sci...208..369Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scientific journal]]s communicate and document the results of research carried out in universities and various other research institutions, serving as an archival record of science. The first scientific journals, ''[[Journal des Sçavans]]'' followed by the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|Philosophical Transactions]]'', began publication in 1665. Since that time the total number of active periodicals has steadily increased. In 1981, one estimate for the number of scientific and technical journals in publication was 11,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Krishna | last=Subramanyam |author2=Subramanyam, Bhadriraju | year=1981 | title=Scientific and Technical Information Resources | publisher=CRC Press | isbn=978-0-8247-8297-9 | oclc=232950234 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States National Library of Medicine]] currently indexes 5,516 journals that contain articles on topics related to the life sciences. Although the journals are in 39 languages, 91 percent of the indexed articles are published in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/medline.html | title=MEDLINE Fact Sheet | publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]] | location=Washington DC | accessdate=October 15, 2011 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016122141/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/medline.html | archivedate=October 16, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scientific journals cover a single scientific field and publish the research within that field; the research is normally expressed in the form of a [[scientific paper]]. Science has become so pervasive in modern societies that it is generally considered necessary to communicate the achievements, news, and ambitions of scientists to a wider populace.

[[List of science magazines|Science magazines]] such as ''[[New Scientist]]'', ''[[Science &amp; Vie]]'', and ''[[Scientific American]]'' cater to the needs of a much wider readership and provide a non-technical summary of popular areas of research, including notable discoveries and advances in certain fields of research. [[Science book]]s engage the interest of many more people. Tangentially, the [[science fiction]] genre, primarily fantastic in nature, engages the public imagination and transmits the ideas, if not the methods, of science.

Recent efforts to intensify or develop links between science and non-scientific disciplines such as [[literature]] or more specifically, [[poetry]], include the ''Creative Writing Science'' resource developed through the [[Royal Literary Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Mario | last=Petrucci | url=http://writeideas.org.uk/creativescience/index.htm | title=Creative Writing&amp;nbsp;– Science | accessdate=April 27, 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106015539/http://writeideas.org.uk/creativescience/index.htm | archivedate=January 6, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, many professional scientists are trained in an [[Academy|academic setting]] and upon completion, attain an [[academic degree]], with the highest degree being a [[doctorate]] such as a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD),&lt;ref name="Cyranoski2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cyranoski | first1 = David | last2 = Gilbert | first2 = Natasha | last3 = Ledford | first3 = Heidi | last4 = Nayar | first4 = Anjali | last5 = Yahia | first5 = Mohammed | year = 2011 | title = Education: The PhD factory | journal = Nature | volume = 472 | issue = 7343 | pages = 276–79 | doi = 10.1038/472276a | pmid = 21512548 | url = https://www.nature.com/news/2011/110420/full/472276a.html| bibcode = 2011Natur.472..276C }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Doctor of Medicine]] (MD), or [[Doctor of Engineering]] (DEng).

Science has historically been a male-dominated field, with some notable exceptions.{{efn|Women in science have included:
* [[Hypatia]] (c. 350–415 CE), of the [[Library of Alexandria]].
* [[Trotula]] of Salerno, a physician c. 1060 CE.
* [[Caroline Herschel]], one of the first professional astronomers of the 18th and 19th centuries.
* [[Christine Ladd-Franklin]], a doctoral student of [[C.S. Peirce]], who published [[Wittgenstein]]'s proposition 5.101 in her dissertation, 40 years before Wittgenstein's publication of [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]].
* [[Henrietta Leavitt]], a professional [[Harvard Computers|human computer and astronomer]], who first published the significant relationship between the luminosity of [[Cepheid variable]] stars and their distance from Earth. This allowed Hubble to make the discovery of the [[expanding universe]], which led to the [[Big Bang theory]].
* [[Emmy Noether]], who proved the [[conservation of energy]] and other [[constants of motion]] in 1915.
* [[Marie Curie]], who made discoveries relating to radioactivity along with her husband, and for whom [[Curium]] is named.
* [[Rosalind Franklin]], who worked with X-ray diffraction.
* [[Jocelyn Bell Burnell]], at first not allowed to study science in her preparatory school, persisted, and was the first to observe and precisely analyse the radio pulsars, for which her supervisor was recognized by the 1974 Nobel prize in Physics. (Later awarded a Special Breakthough prize in Physics in 2018, she donated the cash award in order that women, ethnic minority, and refugee students might become physics researchers.)

In the late 20th century, active recruitment of women and elimination of institutional discrimination on the basis of sex greatly increased the number of women scientists, but large gender disparities remain in some fields; in the early 21st century over half of new biologists were female, while 80% of PhDs in physics are given to men.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} In the early part of the 21st century, women in the United States earned 50.3% of bachelor's degrees, 45.6% of master's degrees, and 40.7% of PhDs in science and engineering fields.

Some also act as [[professional bodies]], regulating the activities of their members in the public interest or the collective interest of the membership. Scholars in the [[sociology of science]]{{who|date=September 2014}} argue that learned societies are of key importance and their formation assists in the emergence and development of new disciplines or professions.

The professionalization of science, begun in the 19th century, was partly enabled by the creation of distinguished [[academy of sciences]] in a number of countries such as the Italian {{lang|it|[[Accademia dei Lincei]]}} in 1603,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year=2006 | url=http://positivamente.lincei.it/ | title=Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei | language=Italian | accessdate=September 11, 2007 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228005402/http://positivamente.lincei.it/ | archivedate=February 28, 2010 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the British [[Royal Society]] in 1660, the French {{lang|fr|[[Académie des Sciences]]}} in 1666,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=G.G. | last=Meynell | url=http://www.haven.u-net.com/6text_7B2.htm#Appendix%202 | title=The French Academy of Sciences, 1666–91: A reassessment of the French Académie royale des sciences under Colbert (1666–83) and Louvois (1683–91) | publisher= | accessdate=October 13, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118174108/http://www.haven.u-net.com/6text_7B2.htm#Appendix%202 | archivedate=January 18, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the American  [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1863, the German [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] in 1911, and the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] in 1928. International scientific organizations, such as the [[International Council for Science]], have since been formed to promote cooperation between the scientific communities of different nations.

=== Science policy ===
{{Main|Science policy|History of science policy|Economics of science}}
[[File:UN-Science-Policy-Business Forum on Environment.jpg|thumb|right|The United Nations ''Global Science-Policy-Business Forum on the Environment'' in Nairobi, Kenya (2017).]]
Science policy is an area of [[public policy]] concerned with the policies that affect the conduct of the scientific enterprise, including [[research funding]], often in pursuance of other national policy goals such as technological innovation to promote commercial product development, weapons development, health care and environmental monitoring. Science policy also refers to the act of applying scientific knowledge and consensus to the development of public policies. Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve the natural sciences. In accordance with [[public policy]] being concerned about the well-being of its citizens, science policy's goal is to consider how science and technology can best serve the public.

[[State (polity)|State]] [[policy]] has influenced the funding of [[public works]] and science for thousands of years, particularly within civilizations with highly organized governments such as [[History of China|imperial China]] and the [[Roman Empire]]. Prominent historical examples include the [[Great Wall of China]], completed over the course of two millennia through the state support of [[Dynasties in Chinese history|several dynasties]], and the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] of the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]], an immense feat of [[hydraulic engineering]] begun by [[Sunshu Ao]] (孫叔敖 7th c. BCE), [[Ximen Bao]] (西門豹 5th c.BCE), and Shi Chi (4th c. BCE). This construction dates from the 6th century BCE  under the [[Sui dynasty|Sui Dynasty]] and is still in use today. In China, such state-supported infrastructure and scientific research projects date at least from the time of the [[Mohists]], who inspired the study of [[logic]] during the period of the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] and the study of defensive fortifications like the Great Wall of China during the [[Warring States period]].

Public policy can directly affect the funding of [[capital equipment]] and intellectual infrastructure for industrial research by providing tax incentives to those organizations that fund research. [[Vannevar Bush]], director of the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] for the United States government, the forerunner of the [[National Science Foundation]], wrote in July 1945 that "Science is a proper concern of government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm|title=Science the Endless Frontier|last=Bush|first=Vannevar|date=July 1945|website=|publisher=National Science Foundation|access-date=November 4, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107221306/https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm|archivedate=November 7, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Funding of science ====
{{Main|Funding of science}}
[[File:CSIRO Main Entomology Building - Central Block.jpg|thumb|right|The [[CSIRO|Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) Main Entomology Building in Australia]]
Scientific research is often funded through a competitive process in which potential research projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive funding. Such processes, which are run by government, corporations, or foundations, allocate scarce funds. Total research funding in most [[developed country|developed countries]] is between 1.5% and 3% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]].&lt;ref name="OECD2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/49/45/24236156.pdf |format=PDF |title=Main Science and Technology Indicators&amp;nbsp;– 2008-1 |publisher=[[OECD]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tamBWVvW?url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/49/45/24236156.pdf |archivedate=October 19, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[OECD]], around two-thirds of [[research and development]] in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry, and 20% and 10% respectively by [[universities]] and government. The government funding proportion in certain industries is higher, and it dominates research in [[social science]] and [[humanities]]. Similarly, with some exceptions (e.g. [[biotechnology]]) government provides the bulk of the funds for [[Basic science|basic scientific research]]. Many governments have dedicated agencies to support scientific research. Prominent scientific organizations include the [[National Science Foundation]] in the [[United States]], the [[CONICET|National Scientific and Technical Research Council]] in Argentina, [[CSIRO|Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) in Australia, {{lang|fr|[[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]]}} in France, the [[Max Planck Society]] and {{lang|de|[[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]]}} in Germany, and [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]] in Spain. In commercial research and development, all but the most research-oriented corporations focus more heavily on near-term commercialisation possibilities rather than "[[Blue skies research|blue-sky]]" ideas or technologies (such as [[nuclear fusion]]).

{{Further|Science outreach|Science communication}}
[[File:Dinosaur exhibit - Houston Museum of Natural Science - DSC01881.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Dinosaur exhibit in the [[Houston Museum of Natural Science]]]]
The [[public awareness of science]] relates to the attitudes, behaviors, opinions, and activities that make up the relations between science and the general public. it integrates various themes and activities such as [[science communication]], [[science museum]]s, [[science festival]]s, [[science fair]]s, [[citizen science]], and [[science in popular culture]]. Social scientists have devised various metrics to measure the public understanding of science such as factual knowledge, self-reported knowledge, and structural knowledge.&lt;ref name ="Ladwig"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ladwig|first1=Peter|title=Perceived familiarity or factual knowledge?

===Science journalism===
{{Main|Science journalism}}
The [[mass media]] face a number of pressures that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims in terms of their credibility within the scientific community as a whole. Determining how much weight to give different sides in a [[scientific debate]] may require considerable expertise regarding the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Dickson | first=David | date=October 11, 2004 | url=http://www.scidev.net/en/editorials/science-journalism-must-keep-a-critical-edge.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621053624/http://www.scidev.net/en/editorials/science-journalism-must-keep-a-critical-edge.html | archivedate=June 21, 2010 | title=Science journalism must keep a critical edge | publisher=Science and Development Network

=== Politicization of science ===
{{Main|Politicization of science}}
[[File:Cook et al. (2016) Studies consensus.jpg|thumb|300px|Results of seven papers from 2004–2015 assessing the overwhelming scientific consensus on man-made global warming (see [[Surveys of scientists' views on climate change]]), in contrast to the [[Global warming controversy|political controversy over this issue]], particularly in the [[Public opinion on global warming#United States|United States]].]]
[[Politicization of science]] occurs when [[government]], [[business]], or [[advocacy group]]s use legal or economic pressure to influence the findings of scientific research or the way it is disseminated, reported, or interpreted. Many factors can act as facets of the politicization of science such as [[Populism|populist]] [[anti-intellectualism]], perceived threats to religious beliefs, [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] [[subjectivism]], and fear for business interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldberg |first1=Jeanne |title=The Politicization of Scientific Issues: Looking through Galileo's Lens or through the Imaginary Looking Glass |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=34–39 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180816182350/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/politicization_of_scientific_issues |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politicization of science is usually accomplished when scientific information is presented in a way that emphasizes the uncertainty associated with the scientific evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bolsen|first1=Toby|last2=Druckman|first2=James N.|title=Counteracting the Politicization of Science|journal=Journal of Communication|date=2015|issue=65|page=746}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tactics such as shifting conversation, failing to acknowledge facts, and capitalizing on doubt of scientific consensus have been used to gain more attention for views that have been undermined by scientific evidence.&lt;ref name = "Freudenberg 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freudenberg|first1=William F.|title=Scientific Certainty Argumentation Methods (SCAMs): Science and the Politics of Doubt|journal=Sociological Inquiry|volume=78|pages=2–38|doi=10.1111/j.1475-682X.2008.00219|doi-broken-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of issues that have involved the politicization of science include the [[global warming controversy]], [[health effects of pesticides]], and [[health effects of tobacco]].&lt;ref name = "Freudenberg 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "van Der Linden2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van der Linden|first1=Sander|last2=Leiserowitz|first2=Anthony|last3=Rosenthal|first3=Seth|last4=Maibach|first4=Edward|title=Inoculating the Public against Misinformation about Climate Change|journal=Global Challenges|volume=1|issue=2|page=1|doi=10.1002/gch2.201600008|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Pseudoscience]]''' is a broad group of theories or assertions about the natural world that claim or appear to be [[scientific]], but that are not accepted as scientific by the [[scientific community]].  Pseudoscience does ''not'' include most obsolete scientific or medical theories (see {{cl|Obsolete scientific theories}}), nor does it include every idea that currently lacks sufficient scientific evidence (e.g. [[String theory]]).

This category comprises well-known topics that are generally considered pseudoscientific by the scientific community (such as [[astrology]]) and topics that have very few followers and are obviously pseudoscientific (such as the modern belief in a [[Flat Earth Society|flat Earth]]).&lt;!-- Please see talk page for policy on inclusion criteria --&gt; The [[pejorative]] term itself is contested by various groups for various reasons.  Generally speaking, if an article belongs in this category, the article's lead will contain a well-sourced statement that the subject is considered pseudoscience. For people who advocate for these subjects, see [[:Category:Advocates of pseudoscience]].

{{Category explanation|'''[[branches of science]]''' divided into four major groups: 
* [[Applied sciences]], which apply existing scientific knowledge to develop more practical applications, like technology or inventions
* [[Formal sciences]] (such as [[mathematics]] and [[logic]], which use an ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', as opposed to [[fact]]ual, [[methodology]])
* [[Natural sciences]], which study natural phenomena (including [[Physics|fundamental forces]] and [[Biology|biological life]])

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as a topical overview of science:

'''[[Science]]''' – the systematic effort of acquiring knowledge—through observation and experimentation coupled with logic and reasoning to find out what can be proved or not proved—and the knowledge thus acquired. The word "science" comes from the Latin word "scientia" meaning [[knowledge]]. A practitioner of science is called a "[[scientist]]". Modern science respects [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] [[logical reasoning]], and follows a set of core procedures or rules in order to determine the nature and underlying natural laws of the universe and everything in it. Some scientists do not know of the rules themselves, but follow them through research policies. These procedures are known as the [[#Scientific method|scientific method]].

{{TOC limit|3}}

== Essence of science ==
* [[Research]] – systematic investigation into existing or new knowledge.
* [[Scientific discovery]] – observation of new phenomena, new actions, or new events and providing new reasoning to explain the knowledge gathered through such observations with previously acquired knowledge from abstract thought and everyday experiences.
* [[Laboratory]] – facility that provides controlled conditions in which scientific research, experiments, and measurement may be performed.
* [[Objectivity (science)|Objectivity]] – the idea that scientists, in attempting to uncover truths about the natural world, must aspire to eliminate personal or cognitive biases, a priori commitments, emotional involvement, etc.
* [[Inquiry]] – any process that has the aim of augmenting knowledge, resolving doubt, or solving a problem.

== Scientific method ==

[[Scientific method]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of scientific method|outline]]) – body of techniques for investigating phenomena and acquiring new knowledge, as well as for correcting and integrating previous knowledge. It is based on observable, empirical, measurable evidence, and subject to laws of reasoning, both deductive and inductive.
* [[Empirical method]] –
* Experimental method – The steps involved in order to produce a reliable and logical conclusion include:
*# Asking a question about a natural [[phenomenon]]
*# Making observations of the phenomenon
*# Forming a [[hypothesis]] – proposed explanation for a phenomenon. For a hypothesis to be a scientific hypothesis, the scientific method requires that one can test it. Scientists generally base scientific hypotheses on previous observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available scientific theories. 
*# [[Predicting]] a logical consequence of the hypothesis
*# Testing the hypothesis through an experiment – methodical procedure carried out with the goal of verifying, falsifying, or establishing the validity of a hypothesis. The 3 types of scientific experiments are:
*#* [[Controlled experiment]] – experiment that compares the results obtained from an experimental sample against a control sample, which is practically identical to the experimental sample except for the one aspect the effect of which is being tested (the independent variable).
*#* [[Natural experiment]] – empirical study in which the experimental conditions (i.e., which units receive which treatment) are determined by nature or by other factors out of the control of the experimenters and yet the treatment assignment process is arguably exogenous. Thus, natural experiments are observational studies and are not controlled in the traditional sense of a randomized experiment.
*#** [[Observational study]] – draws inferences about the possible effect of a treatment on subjects, where the assignment of subjects into a treated group versus a control group is outside the control of the investigator.
*#* [[Field experiment]] – applies the scientific method to experimentally examine an intervention in the real world (or as many experimentalists like to say, naturally occurring environments) rather than in the laboratory.  See also [[field research]].
*# Gather and analyze data from experiments or observations, including indicators of [[uncertainty]].
*# Draw [[logical consequence|conclusion]]s by comparing data with predictions.  Possible outcomes:
*#* Conclusive:
*#** The hypothesis is falsified by the data.  
*#** Data are consistent with the hypothesis.
*#** Data are consistent with alternative hypotheses. 
*#* Inconclusive:
*#** Data are not relevant to the hypothesis, or data and predictions are [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurate]].
*#** There is too much uncertainty in the data to draw any conclusion.
* [[Deductive-nomological model]]
* [[Scientific modelling]] –
* Models of scientific method
** [[Hypothetico-deductive model]] – proposed description of scientific method. According to it, scientific inquiry proceeds by formulating a hypothesis in a form that could conceivably be falsified by a test on observable data. A test that could and does run contrary to predictions of the hypothesis is taken as a falsification of the hypothesis. A test that could but does not run contrary to the hypothesis corroborates the theory.

== Branches of science ==
{{See also|Index of branches of science}}

[[Branches of science]] – divisions within science with respect to the entity or system concerned, which typically embodies its own [[terminology]] and [[nomenclature]].

=== Natural science ===
{{See also|Outline of science#Social science}}

[[Natural science]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of natural science|outline]]) – major branch of science, that tries to explain and predict nature's phenomena, based on empirical evidence. In natural science, hypotheses must be verified scientifically to be regarded as scientific theory. Validity, accuracy, and social mechanisms ensuring quality control, such as peer review and repeatability of findings, are amongst the criteria and methods used for this purpose. Natural science can be broken into two main branches: biology, and physical science. Each of these branches, and all of their sub-branches, are referred to as natural sciences.

=== Formal science ===
[[Formal science]] – branches of knowledge that are concerned with formal systems, such as those under the branches of: logic, mathematics, computer science, statistics, and some aspects of linguistics.

=== Social science ===
[[Social science]] – study of the social world constructed between humans. The social sciences usually limit themselves to an anthropomorphically centric view of these interactions with minimal emphasis on the inadvertent impact of social human behavior on the external environment (physical, biological, ecological, etc.). 'Social' is the concept of exchange/influence of ideas, thoughts, and relationship interactions (resulting in harmony, peace, self enrichment, favoritism, maliciousness, justice seeking, etc.) between humans. The scientific method is utilized in many social sciences, albeit adapted to the needs of the social construct being studied.

[[File:The Scientific Universe.png|thumb|450px|The scale of the Universe mapped to branches of science and the [[hierarchy of the sciences|hierarchy of the sciences]].]]

The '''branches of science''', also referred to as [[Science|sciences]], "scientific fields", or "scientific disciplines," are commonly divided into three major groups:

*'''[[Formal science|Formal sciences]]''': the study of [[mathematics]] and [[logic]], which use an ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', as opposed to [[fact]]ual, [[methodology]].
*'''[[Natural science]]s''': the study of natural phenomena (including cosmological, geological, physical, chemical, and biological factors of the universe)
*'''[[Social science]]s''': the study of [[human behavior]] and [[Society|societies]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Social science|Social Science]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=March 2018}}

Natural and social sciences are [[empirical]] sciences, meaning that the knowledge must be based on observable phenomena and must be capable of being verified by other researchers working under the same conditions.
{{sfn|Popper|2002|p=20}} This verifiability may well vary even ''within'' a scientific discipline &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author=Davide Castelvecchi, Nature Magazine | date=2015-12-23 | url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-string-theory-science/ | title=Is String Theory science? | publisher=Scientific American | accessdate=2018-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author=Editorial Staff | date=2016-03-03 | url=https://www.nature.com/news/psychology-s-reproducibility-problem-is-exaggerated-say-psychologists-1.19498 | title=Psychology's reproducibility problem | publisher=Nature | accessdate=2018-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural, social, and formal science make up the [[fundamental science]]s, which form the basis of [[interdisciplinary]] and [[applied science]]s such as [[engineering]] and [[medicine]]. Specialized scientific disciplines that exist in multiple categories may include parts of other scientific disciplines but often possess their own terminologies and expertises.&lt;ref&gt;see: {{Cite web| author=Editorial Staff | date=March 7, 2008 | url=http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2007/03/scientific_method_relationship.php | title=Scientific Method: Relationships among Scientific Paradigms | publisher=Seed magazine | accessdate=2007-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

== Natural/Pure Science ==
{{Main article|Natural science|Outline of natural science}}

Natural science is a branch of [[science]] that seeks to [[wiktionary:elucidate|elucidate]] the rules that govern the [[nature|natural]] world by applying an [[Empirical method|empirical]] and [[scientific method]] to the study of the [[universe]]. The term natural sciences is used to distinguish it from the [[social sciences]], which apply the scientific method to study [[human behavior]] and [[social]] [[patterns]]; the [[humanities]], which use a [[critical theory|critical]], or [[Analytic philosophy|analytical approach]] to the study of the [[human condition]]; and the [[formal sciences]].

=== Physical science ===
{{Main article|Physical science|Outline of physical science}}

Physical science is an encompassing term for the branches of natural science and science that study non-living systems, in contrast to the life sciences. However, the term "physical" creates an unintended, somewhat arbitrary distinction, since many branches of physical science also study biological phenomena. There is a difference between physical science and physics.

==== Physics ====
{{Main article|Physics|Outline of physics}}

''Physics'' (from {{lang-grc|φύσις|[[physis]]|nature}}) is a [[natural science]] that involves the study of [[matter]]&lt;ref name = "feynman"&gt;
[[Richard Feynman]] begins [[The Feynman Lectures on Physics|his ''Lectures'']] with the [[atomic theory|atomic hypothesis]], as his most compact statement of all scientific knowledge: "If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations ..., what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is ... that ''all things are made up of atoms – little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. ...''" {{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: The term 'universe' is defined as everything that physically exists: the entirety of space and time, all forms of matter, energy and momentum, and the physical laws and constants that govern them. However, the term 'universe' may also be used in slightly different contextual senses, denoting concepts such as the [[cosmos]] or the [[world (philosophy)|philosophical world]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Physics is one of the oldest [[academic discipline]]s, perhaps the oldest through its inclusion of [[astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Evidence exists that the earliest civilizations dating back to beyond 3000&amp;nbsp;BCE, such as the [[Sumer]]ians, [[Ancient Egyptians]], and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], all had a predictive knowledge and a very basic understanding of the motions of the Sun, Moon, and stars.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the last two millennia, physics was a part of [[natural philosophy]] along with [[chemistry]], certain branches of [[mathematics]], and [[biology]], but during the [[Scientific Revolution]] in the 16th century, the [[natural science]]s emerged as unique research programs in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Bacon]]'s 1620 ''[[Novum Organum]]'' was critical in the [[History of scientific method|development of scientific method]].&lt;/ref&gt; Certain research areas are [[interdisciplinary]], such as [[biophysics]] and [[quantum chemistry]], which means that the boundaries of physics are not [[demarcation problem|rigidly defined]]. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries [[physicalism]] emerged as a major unifying feature of the [[philosophy of science]] as physics provides fundamental explanations for every [[observation|observed]] natural [[phenomenon]]. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms of other sciences, while opening to new research areas in mathematics and philosophy.

==== Chemistry ====
{{Main article|Chemistry|Outline of chemistry}}

''Chemistry'' (the etymology of the word has been much disputed)&lt;ref&gt;'''See:''' [[Chemistry (etymology)]] for possible origins of this word.&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[science]] of [[matter]] and the changes it undergoes. The science of matter is also addressed by [[physics]], but while physics takes a more general and fundamental approach, chemistry is more specialized, being concerned by the composition, behavior (or reaction), structure, and properties of [[matter]], as well as the changes it undergoes during [[chemical reaction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Chemistry Chemistry]. (n.d.). Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary. Retrieved August 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[physical science]] which studies various [[chemical substance|substance]]s, [[atom]]s, [[molecule]]s, and matter (especially carbon based); [[biochemistry]], the study of [[chemical substance|substances]] found in [[organisms|biological organisms]]; [[physical chemistry]], the study of chemical processes using physical concepts such as [[thermodynamics]] and [[quantum mechanics]]; and [[analytical chemistry]], the analysis of material samples to gain an understanding of their [[chemical composition]] and [[Chemical structure|structure]]. Many more specialized disciplines have emerged in recent years, e.g. [[neurochemistry]] the chemical study of the [[nervous system]] (see [[#Subdisciplines|subdisciplines]]).

==== Earth science ====
{{Main article|Earth science|Outline of earth science}}

''Earth science'' (also known as ''geoscience'', ''the geosciences'' or ''the Earth sciences'') is an all-embracing term for the [[science]]s related to the [[planet]] [[Earth (planet)|Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=Earth+science&amp;sub=Search+WordNet&amp;o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o1=1&amp;o6=&amp;o4=&amp;o3=&amp;h=0 Wordnet Search: Earth science]&lt;/ref&gt; It is arguably a special case in [[planetary science]], the Earth being the only known [[life]]-bearing planet. There are both [[reductionist]] and [[holism|holistic]] approaches to Earth sciences. The formal discipline of Earth sciences may include the study of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, oceans and biosphere, as well as the solid earth. Typically Earth scientists will use tools from [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geography]], [[chronology]] and [[mathematics]] to build a quantitative understanding of how the Earth system works, and how it evolved to its current state.

===== Ecology=====
{{Main article|Ecology|Outline of ecology}}

Ecology (from Greek: οἶκος, "house"; -λογία, "study of") is the [[scientific]] study of the relationships that living [[organisms]] have with each other and with their abiotic [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Topics of interest to ecologists include the composition, distribution, amount ([[biomass]]), number, and changing states of organisms within and among [[ecosystems]].

===== Oceanography =====
{{Main article|Oceanography}}

Oceanography, or marine biology, is the branch of [[Earth science]] that studies ocean. It covers a wide range of topics, including [[marine organisms]] and [[ecosystem]] dynamics; [[ocean currents]], [[water waves|waves]], and geophysical fluid dynamics; [[plate tectonics]] and the geology of the sea floor; and [[flux|fluxes]] of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries. These diverse topics reflect multiple disciplines that oceanographers blend to further knowledge of the world ocean and understanding of processes within it: [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[geology]], [[meteorology]], and [[physics]] as well as [[geography]].

===== Geology =====
{{Main article|Geology|Outline of geology}}

Geology (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] γῆ, gê, "earth" and λόγος, [[logos]], "study") is the science comprising the study of solid [[Earth]], the [[rocks]] of which it is composed, and the processes by which they change.

===== Meteorology=====
{{Main article|Meteorology|Outline of meteorology}}

Meteorology is the [[interdisciplinary]] scientific study of the [[atmosphere]]. Studies in the field stretch back millennia, though significant progress in meteorology did not occur until the 17th century. The 19th century saw breakthroughs occur after observing networks developed across several countries. After the development of the computer in the latter half of the 20th century, breakthroughs in [[weather forecasting]] were achieved.

==== Space Science or Astronomy ====
{{Main article|Space Science|Outline of space science}}

Space science or Astronomy is the study of everything in outer space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/space+science space science – definition of space science by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This has sometimes been called [[astronomy]], but recently astronomy has come to be regarded as a division of broader space science, which has grown to include other related fields,&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/planetary-science/planetary-science-data/national-space-science-data-center-nssdc/ National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) – NASA Science&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; such as studying issues related to [[Spaceflight|space travel]] and [[space exploration]] (including [[space medicine]]), [[space archaeology]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/space+science Space science | Define Space science at Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and science performed in [[outer space]] (see [[space research]]).

===  Science of living things ===
{{Main article|Life science|Outline of life sciences}}

''The science of living things comprises the branches of science&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemirror.com/branches-of-science-the-complete-list Branches of Science]&lt;/ref&gt; that involve the scientific study of living organisms, like plants, animals, and human beings. However, the study of behavior of organisms, such as practiced in ethology and psychology, is only included in as much as it involves a clearly biological aspect. While biology remains the centerpiece of the science of living things, technological advances in molecular biology and biotechnology have led to a burgeoning of specializations and new, often interdisciplinary, fields.

==== Biology ====
{{Main article|Biology|Outline of biology}}

''Biology'' is the branch of [[natural science]] concerned with the study of [[life]] and living [[organism]]s, including their structure, function, growth, origin, evolution, distribution, and taxonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Based on definition from [http://www.bio.txstate.edu/~wetlands/Glossary/glossary.html Aquarena Wetlands Project glossary of terms.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040608000000/http://www.bio.txstate.edu/~wetlands/Glossary/glossary.html |date=June 8, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biology is a vast subject containing many subdivisions, topics, and disciplines.

===== Zoology =====
{{Main article|Zoology|Outline of zoology}} 

Zoology, occasionally spelled zoölogy, is the branch of science that relates to the animal kingdom, including the structure, embryology, evolution, classification, habits, and distribution of all animals, both living and extinct. The term is derived from Ancient Greek ζῷον (zōon, "animal") + λόγος (logos, "knowledge"). Some branches of zoology include: [[anthrozoology]], [[arachnology]], [[archaeozoology]], [[cetology]], [[embryology]], [[entomology]], [[helminthology]], [[herpetology]], [[histology]], [[ichthyology]], [[malacology]], [[mammalogy]], [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[nematology]], [[ornithology]], [[palaeozoology]], [[pathology]], [[primatology]], [[protozoology]], [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], and [[zoogeography]].

=====Human biology=====
{{main article|Human biology}}
Human biology is an interdisciplinary academic field of biology, biological anthropology, nutrition and medicine which focuses on humans; it is closely related to primate biology, and a number of other fields.

Some branches of biology include: [[microbiology]], [[anatomy]], [[neurology]] and [[neuroscience]], [[immunology]], [[genetics]], [[physiology]], [[pathology]], [[biophysics]], [[biolinguistics]], and [[ophthalmology]].

===== Botany=====
{{Main article|Botany|Outline of botany}}

Botany, plant science, or plant biology is a branch of biology that involves the scientific study of plant life. Botany covers a wide range of scientific disciplines including structure, growth, reproduction, metabolism, development, diseases, chemical properties, and evolutionary relationships among taxonomic groups. Botany began with early human efforts to identify edible, medicinal and poisonous plants, making it one of the oldest sciences. Today botanists study over 550,000 species of living organisms.
The term "botany" comes from Greek βοτάνη, meaning "pasture, grass, fodder", perhaps via the idea of a livestock keeper needing to know which plants are safe for livestock to eat.

== Social sciences ==
{{Main article|Social sciences|Outline of social science}}

The ''social sciences'' are the [[field of study|fields]] of [[Scholarly method|scholarship]] that study society. "Social science" is commonly used as an [[umbrella term]] to refer to a plurality of fields outside of the [[natural sciences]]. These include: [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], [[business administration]], [[communication]], [[criminology]], [[economics]], [[education]], [[government]], [[linguistics]], [[international relations]], [[political science]], some branches of [[psychology]] (results of which can not be replicated or validated easily - e.g. [[social psychology]]), [[public health]], [[ theology]], [[sociology]] and, in some contexts, [[geography]], [[history]] and [[law]].&lt;ref name="issues"&gt;{{cite book |last=Verheggen |year=1999 |chapter=From shared representations to consensually coordinated actions |title=Theoretical Issues in Psychology |editor-first=John |editor-last=Morrs |publisher=International Society for Theoretical Psychology |location= |isbn= |display-authors=etal|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.staff.u-szeged.hu/~garai/Vygotskyboom.htm |first=L. |last=Garai |first2=M. |last2=Kocski |title=Another crisis in the psychology: A possible motive for the Vygotsky-boom |journal=Journal of Russian and East-European Psychology |year=1995 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=82–94 |doi=10.2753/RPO1061-0405330182 |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal sciences ==
{{Main article|Formal sciences|Outline of formal science}}

The ''formal sciences'' are the branches of science that are concerned with [[formal system]]s, such as [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[theoretical computer science]], [[information theory]], [[systems theory]], [[decision theory]], [[statistics]], and [[theoretical linguistics]].

Unlike other sciences, the formal sciences are not concerned with the validity of [[Scientific theory|theories]] based on [[observation]]s in the [[Reality|real world]] ([[empirical knowledge]]), but rather with the properties of [[formal system]]s based on [[definition]]s and [[Rule of inference|rule]]s. Methods of the formal sciences are, however, essential to the construction and testing of [[scientific model]]s dealing with observable reality,{{sfn|Popper|2002|pp=79&amp;ndash;82}} and major advances in formal sciences have often enabled major advances in the empirical sciences.

=== Decision theory ===
{{Main article|Decision theory}}

''Decision theory'' in economics, psychology, philosophy, mathematics, and statistics is concerned with identifying the values, uncertainties and other issues relevant in a given decision, its rationality, and the resulting optimal decision. It is very closely related to the field of game law.

=== Logic ===
{{Main article|Logic|Outline of logic}}

''Logic'' (from the Greek ''[[wiktionary:λογική|λογική]]'' logikē)&lt;ref&gt;"possessed of reason, intellectual, dialectical, argumentative", also related to ''[[wiktionary:λόγος|λόγος]]'' (logos), "word, thought, idea, argument, account, reason, or principle" (Liddell &amp; Scott 1999; Online Etymology Dictionary 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; is the formal systematic study of the [[principle]]s of valid [[inference]] and correct [[reasoning]]. Logic is used in most intellectual activities, but is studied primarily in the disciplines of [[philosophy]], [[mathematics]], [[semantics]], and [[computer science]].  Logic examines general forms which [[argument]]s may take, which forms are valid, and which are [[fallacies]]. In philosophy, the study of logic figures in most major areas: [[epistemology]], [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]]. In mathematics and computer science, it is the study of valid [[inference]]s within some [[formal language]].&lt;ref name=stanford-logic-onthology&gt;{{cite book | last = Hofweber | first = T. | year = 2004 | chapter = Logic and Ontology |  title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | editor-first = Edward N | editor-last = Zalta | editor-link = Edward N. Zalta | chapterurl = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ontology}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Logic is also studied in [[argumentation theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-first = J. Robert | editor1-last = Cox | editor2-first = Charles Arthur | editor2-last = Willard | editor2-link = Charles Arthur Willard | title = Advances in Argumentation Theory and Research | publisher = [[Southern Illinois University Press]] | year = 1983 | isbn = 978-0-8093-1050-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematics ===
{{Main article|Mathematics|Outline of mathematics}}

''Mathematics'', first of all known as The Science of numbers which is classified in Arithmetic and Algebra, is classified as a formal science,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1173067/?site_locale=en_GB Marcus Tomalin (2006) ''Linguistics and the Formal Sciences'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Benedikt Löwe]] (2002) [https://www.jstor.org/pss/20117289 "The Formal Sciences: Their Scope, Their Foundations, and Their Unity"]&lt;/ref&gt; has both similarities and differences with the empirical sciences (the natural and social sciences). It is similar to empirical sciences in that it involves an objective, careful and systematic study of an area of knowledge; it is different because of its method of verifying its knowledge, using [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] rather than empirical methods.{{sfn|Popper|2002|pp=10&amp;ndash;11}}

=== Statistics ===
{{Main article|Statistics|Outline of statistics}}

''Statistics'' is the study of the collection, organization, and interpretation of [[data]].&lt;ref name=Dodge&gt;Dodge, Y. (2003) ''The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms'', OUP. {{ISBN|0-19-920613-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dict.asp?Word=statistics The Free Online Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; It deals with all aspects of this, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of [[Statistical survey|surveys]] and [[experimental design|experiments]].&lt;ref name=Dodge/&gt;

A [[statistician]] is someone who is particularly well versed in the ways of thinking necessary for the successful application of statistical analysis. Such people have often gained this experience through working in any of a [[list of fields of application of statistics|wide number of fields]]. There is also a discipline called ''[[mathematical statistics]]'', which is concerned with the theoretical basis of the subject.

The word ''statistics'', when referring to the scientific discipline, is singular, as in "Statistics is an art."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/statistics | title = Statistics | work = Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; This should not be confused with the word ''statistic'', referring to a quantity (such as [[mean]] or [[median]]) calculated from a set of data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/statistic | title = Statistic | work = Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose plural is ''statistics'' ("this statistic seems wrong" or "these statistics are misleading").

=== Systems theory ===
{{Main article|Systems theory}}

''Systems theory'' is the [[Interdisciplinary|interdisciplinary]] study of [[system]]s in general, with the goal of elucidating principles that can be applied to all types of systems in all fields of research. The term does not yet have a well-established, precise meaning, but systems theory can reasonably be considered a specialization of [[systems thinking]] and a generalization of [[systems science]]. The term originates from Ludwig von Bertalanffy's [[#General systems research and systems inquiry|General System Theory]] (GS) and is used in later efforts in other fields, such as the [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]] of [[Alcott Parsons]] and the system-theory of [[Nickolas McLuhan]].

In this context the word ''systems'' is used to refer specifically to self-regulating systems, i.e. that are self-correcting through [[feedback]]. Self-regulating systems are found in nature, including the physiological systems of our body, in local and global ecosystems, and in climate.

=== Theoretical computer science ===
{{Main article|Theoretical computer science}}

''Theoretical computer science'' (TCS) is a division or subset of general [[computer science]] and focuses on more abstract or mathematical aspects of computing.

These divisions and subsets include [[analysis of algorithms]] and [[formal semantics of programming languages]]. Technically, there are hundreds of divisions and subsets besides these two. Each of the multiple parts have their own individual personal leaders (of popularity) and there are many associations and professional social groups and publications of distinction.

== Applied sciences==
{{Main article|Applied science|Outline of applied sciences}}

''Applied science'' is the application of scientific knowledge transferred into a physical environment. Examples include testing a theoretical model through the use of formal science or solving a practical problem through the use of natural science.

Applied science differs from [[fundamental science]], which seeks to describe the most basic objects and forces, having less emphasis on practical applications. Applied science can be like biological science and physical science.

Example fields of applied science include
* [[Engineering]]
* [[Applied mathematics]]
* [[Applied physics]]
* [[Medicine]]
* [[Computer science]]

Fields of [[engineering]] are closely related to applied sciences. Applied science is important for [[technology]] development. Its use in industrial settings is usually referred to as [[research and development]] (R&amp;D).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4311">'''Schmidt Science Fellows''' is a post-doctoral fellowship set up in 2018 and funded by former Google chairman [[Eric Schmidt]] and his wife [[Wendy Schmidt]] and run in partnership with the Rhodes Trust: a non-profit organization who administer the [[Rhodes Scholarship]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/Eric-and-Wendy-Schmidt-seek-to-build-the-next-12271209.php|title=Eric and Wendy Schmidt seek to build the next generation of scientific leaders - SFChronicle.com|date=2017-10-12|website=www.sfchronicle.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is intended to foster interdisciplinary research and teach leadership skills in a select group of [[Postdoctoral researcher|post-doctoral]] scientists. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/anismuslimin/2018/04/24/former-google-chairman-eric-schmidt-announces-new-science-fellows/|title=Former Google Chairman Eric Schmidt Announces New Science Fellows|last=Muslimin|first=Anis|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.labnews.co.uk/features/stepping-boundary-lines-14-12-2018/|title=Stepping over boundary lines|last=Prime|first=Phil|date=2018-12-14|website=Laboratory News|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Structure ==
The fellowship is supported by Schmidt Futures, the philanthropic initiative of Eric Schmidt and Wendy Schmidt&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.labnews.co.uk/features/stepping-boundary-lines-14-12-2018/|title=Stepping over boundary lines|last=Prime|first=Phil|date=2018-12-14|website=Laboratory News|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; who pledged $25 million for the first three years as part of a broader $100 million drive to fund scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2017/10/23/the-schmidts-stretch-out-as-science-funders-with-new-fellowship|title=The Schmidts Stretch Out as Science Funders With New Fellowship|website=Inside Philanthropy|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rhodes Trust acts as a central partner and coordinates the selection process, mediates with partner universities, and assists in the post-doctoral placements of fellows.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The program consists of an 11-month lab-based postdoctoral research study at a leading scientific research university, followed by four global meetings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Selection, allocation, and stipend ==
In its inaugural year fellows were selected from a pool of 220 international applicants from natural sciences, engineering, mathematics, and computer sciences backgrounds; then whittled down to 31 finalists.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hub.jhu.edu/2018/04/24/wesley-fuhrman-schmidt-science-fellows/|title=Johns Hopkins PhD student wins $100,000 fellowship endowed by former Google CEO|last=April 24|first=Hub staff report / Published|last2=2018|date=2018-04-24|website=The Hub|language=en|access-date=2019-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Successful applicants are given $100,000 to study in a field outside of their usual area of research and undertake a series of advanced courses and networking programs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In its first year 14 fellows were selected (eight men and six women) from twelve different universities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

== Motivation ==
The fellowship came about due to a necessity to fund interdisciplinary research,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; which is often lacking grant money. Spending 11 or more months outside of their core areas of research is believed to give future scientific leaders more interdisciplinary skills.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

At least half of the first 14 Schmidt Science Fellows, will be pursuing projects which rely on computation, data, AI or machine learning: technologies which in which Schmidt has shown an interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hub.jhu.edu/2018/04/24/wesley-fuhrman-schmidt-science-fellows/|title=Johns Hopkins PhD student wins $100,000 fellowship endowed by former Google CEO|last=April 24|first=Hub staff report / Published|last2=2018|date=2018-04-24|website=The Hub|language=en|access-date=2019-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

{{Main article|History of astronomy}}
[[File:Senenmut-Grab.JPG|thumb|right|Ancient [[Egyptian astronomy]] is evident in monuments like the [[Astronomical ceiling of Senemut Tomb|ceiling of Senemut's tomb]] from the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt]].]]
[[Astronomy]] is one of the oldest [[natural science]]s. Early civilizations dating back to beyond 3000&amp;nbsp;BCE, such as the [[Sumer]]ians, [[ancient Egypt]]ians, and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], had a predictive knowledge and a basic understanding of the motions of the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], and [[star]]s. The stars and planets were often worshipped, believed to represent gods. While the explanations for the observed positions of the stars were often unscientific and lacking in evidence, these early observations laid the foundation for later astronomy, as the stars were found to traverse [[great circle]]s across the sky,&lt;ref name="krupp2003"/&gt; which however did not explain the positions of the [[planet]]s.

According to [[Asger Aaboe]], the origins of [[Western world|Western]] astronomy can be found in [[Mesopotamia]], and all Western efforts in the [[exact science]]s are descended from late [[Babylonian astronomy]].&lt;ref name ="aaboe1991"&gt;{{harvnb|Aaboe|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Egyptian astronomy|Egyptian astronomers]] left monuments showing knowledge of the constellations and the motions of the celestial bodies,&lt;ref name="clagett1995"&gt;{{harvnb|Clagett|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Ancient Greek poetry|Greek poet]] [[Homer]] wrote of various celestial objects in his ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]''; later [[Greek astronomy|Greek astronomers]] provided names, which are still used today, for most constellations visible from the [[northern hemisphere]].&lt;ref name="thurston1994"&gt;{{harvnb|Thurston|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Natural philosophy ===
{{main article|Natural philosophy}}
[[Natural philosophy]] has its origins in [[Greece]] during the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]], (650 BCE – 480 BCE), when [[Presocratics|pre-Socratic philosophers]] like [[Thales]] rejected [[Methodological naturalism|non-naturalistic]] explanations for natural phenomena and proclaimed that every event had a natural cause.&lt;ref name="singer2008p35"&gt;{{harvnb|Singer|2008|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; They proposed ideas verified by reason and observation, and many of their hypotheses proved successful in experiment;&lt;ref name="lloyd1970pp108-109"&gt;{{harvnb|Lloyd|1970|pp=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, [[atomism]] was found to be correct approximately 2000 years after it was proposed by [[Leucippus]] and his pupil [[Democritus]].&lt;ref name="about-atomism"&gt;

=== Physics in the medieval European and Islamic world ===
{{main article|European science in the Middle Ages}}
{{main article|Physics in the medieval Islamic world}}
[[File:Pinhole-camera.svg|thumb|The basic way a pinhole camera works]]

The [[Western Roman Empire]] fell in the fifth century, and this resulted in a decline in intellectual pursuits in the western part of Europe. By contrast, the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (also known as the [[Byzantine Empire]]) resisted the attacks from the barbarians, and continued to advance various fields of learning, including physics.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David. (1992) ''The Beginnings of Western Science''. University of Chicago Press. Page 363.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sixth century Isidore of Miletus created an important compilation of Archimedes' works that are copied in the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]].

In sixth century Europe [[John Philoponus]], a Byzantine scholar, questioned [[Aristotle]]'s teaching of physics and noting its flaws. He introduced the [[theory of impetus]]. Aristotle's physics was not scrutinized until John Philoponus appeared, and unlike Aristotle who based his physics on verbal argument, Philoponus relied on observation.{{dubious|date=February 2019}} On Aristotle's physics John Philoponus wrote:

“''But this is completely erroneous, and our view may be corroborated by actual observation more effectively than by any sort of verbal argument. For if you let fall from the same height two weights of which one is many times as heavy as the other, you will see that the ratio of the times required for the motion does not depend on the ratio of the weights, but that the difference in time is a very small one. And so, if the difference in the weights is not considerable, that is, of one is, let us say, double the other, there will be no difference, or else an imperceptible difference, in time, though the difference in weight is by no means negligible, with one body weighing twice as much as the other''”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://homepages.wmich.edu/~mcgrew/philfall.htm | title=John Philoponus, Commentary on Aristotle's Physics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Philoponus' criticism of Aristotelian principles of physics served as an inspiration for [[Galileo Galilei]] ten centuries later,&lt;ref name=dialogTwoNewSciences &gt;"in order to better understand just how conclusive Aristotle’s demonstration is, we may, in my opinion, deny both of his assumptions. And as to the first, I greatly doubt that Aristotle ever tested by experiment whether it be true that two stones, one weighing ten times as much as the other, if allowed to fall, at the same instant, from a height of, say, 100 cubits, would so differ in speed that when the heavier had reached the ground, the other would not have fallen more than 10 cubits.
:Simp. - His language would seem to indicate that he had tried the experiment, because he says: We see the heavier; now the word see shows that he had made the experiment.
:Sagr. - But I, Simplicio, who have made the test can assure[107] you that a cannon ball weighing one or two hundred pounds, or even more, will not reach the ground by as much as a span ahead of a musket ball weighing only half a pound, provided both are dropped from a height of 200 cubits."
*from: [[Galileo]] (1638) ''[[Two New Sciences]]''&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Scientific Revolution]]. Galileo cited Philoponus substantially in his works when arguing that Aristotelian physics was flawed.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David. (1992) ''The Beginnings of Western Science''.

It was a step toward the modern ideas of inertia and momentum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | chapter-url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/buridan/ | title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| chapter=John Buridan| publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University| year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Science in the medieval Islamic world|Islamic scholarship]] inherited [[Aristotelian physics]] from the Greeks and during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] developed it further, especially placing emphasis on observation and ''a priori'' reasoning, developing early forms of the [[scientific method]].

The most notable innovations were in the field of optics and vision, which came from the works of many scientists like [[Ibn Sahl (mathematician)|Ibn Sahl]], [[Al-Kindi]], [[Ibn al-Haytham]], [[Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī|Al-Farisi]] and [[Avicenna]]. The most notable work was ''[[Book of Optics|The Book of Optics]]'' (also known as Kitāb al-Manāẓir), written by Ibn al-Haytham, in which he conclusively disproved the ancient Greek idea about vision, but also came up with a new theory. In the book, he presented a study of the phenomenon of the [[camera obscura]] (his thousand-year-old version of the [[pinhole camera]]) and delved further into the way the eye itself works. Using dissections and the knowledge of previous scholars, he was able to begin to explain how light enters the eye. He asserted that the light ray is focused, but the actual explanation of how light projected to the back of the eye had to wait until 1604. His ''Treatise on Light'' explained the camera obscura, hundreds of years before the modern development of photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howard|Rogers|1995|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven-volume ''Book of Optics'' (''Kitab al-Manathir'') hugely influenced thinking across disciplines from the theory of visual [[perception]] to the nature of [[perspectivity|perspective]] in medieval art, in both the East and the West, for more than 600 years. Many later European scholars and fellow polymaths, from [[Robert Grosseteste]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] to [[René Descartes]], [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Isaac Newton]], were in his debt. Indeed, the influence of Ibn al-Haytham's Optics ranks alongside that of Newton's work of the same title, published 700 years later.

The translation of ''The Book of Optics'' had a huge impact on Europe. From it, later European scholars were able to build devices that replicated those Ibn al-Haytham had built, and understand the way light works. From this, such important things as eyeglasses, magnifying glasses, telescopes, and cameras were developed.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws comprising classical physics remain very widely used for objects on everyday scales travelling at non-relativistic speeds, since they provide a very close approximation in such situations, and theories such as [[quantum mechanics]] and the [[theory of relativity]] simplify to their classical equivalents at such scales. However, inaccuracies in classical mechanics for very small objects and very high velocities led to the development of modern physics in the 20th century.

[[Modern physics]] began in the early 20th century with the work of [[Max Planck]] in [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]]. Both of these theories came about due to inaccuracies in classical mechanics in certain situations. [[Classical mechanics]] predicted a varying [[speed of light]], which could not be resolved with the constant speed predicted by [[Maxwell's equations]] of electromagnetism; this discrepancy was corrected by Einstein's theory of [[special relativity]], which replaced classical mechanics for fast-moving bodies and allowed for a constant speed of light.&lt;ref name="oconnorrobertson1996-relativity"&gt;{{harvnb|O'Connor|Robertson|1996a}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Black body radiation]] provided another problem for classical physics, which was corrected when Planck proposed that the excitation of material oscillators is possible only in discrete steps proportional to their frequency; this, along with the [[photoelectric effect]] and a complete theory predicting discrete [[energy levels]] of [[Atomic orbital|electron orbitals]], led to the theory of quantum mechanics taking over from classical physics at very small scales.&lt;ref name="oconnorrobertson1996-quantum"&gt;{{harvnb|O'Connor|Robertson|1996b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quantum mechanics]] would come to be pioneered by [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Erwin Schrödinger]] and [[Paul Dirac]].&lt;ref name="oconnorrobertson1996-quantum"/&gt; From this early work, and work in related fields, the [[Standard Model of particle physics]] was derived.&lt;ref name="donut2001"&gt;{{harvnb|DONUT|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the discovery of a particle with properties consistent with the [[Higgs boson]] at [[CERN]] in 2012,&lt;ref name="cho2012"&gt;{{harvnb|Cho|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; all [[fundamental particles]] predicted by the standard model, and no others, appear to exist; however, [[physics beyond the Standard Model]], with theories such as [[supersymmetry]], is an active area of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Womersley |first=J. |year=2005 |title=Beyond the Standard Model |url=http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/sites/default/files/legacy/pdfs/200502/beyond_the_standard_model.pdf |journal=[[Symmetry (magazine)|Symmetry]] |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=22–25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924114111/http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/sites/default/files/legacy/pdfs/200502/beyond_the_standard_model.pdf |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Areas of [[mathematics]] in general are important to this field, such as the study of [[probability amplitude|probabilities]] and [[Group theory#Physics|groups]].

==Philosophy==
{{Main article|Philosophy of physics}}
In many ways, physics stems from [[ancient Greek philosophy]]. From [[Thales]]' first attempt to characterise matter, to [[Democritus]]' deduction that matter ought to reduce to an invariant state, the [[Ptolemaic astronomy]] of a crystalline [[firmament]], and Aristotle's book ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' (an early book on physics, which attempted to analyze and define motion from a philosophical point of view), various Greek philosophers advanced their own theories of nature. Physics was known as [[natural philosophy]] until the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Noll notes that some universities still use this title —{{cite journal |last1=Noll |first1=Walter |title=On the Past and Future of Natural Philosophy |url=http://www.math.cmu.edu/~wn0g/noll/PFNP.pdf |journal=Journal of Elasticity |date=23 June 2006 |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=1–11 |doi=10.1007/s10659-006-9068-y |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418072444/http://www.math.cmu.edu/~wn0g/noll/PFNP.pdf |archivedate=18 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 19th century, physics was realised as a discipline distinct from philosophy and the other sciences. Physics, as with the rest of science, relies on [[philosophy of science]] and its "scientific method" to advance our knowledge of the physical world.&lt;ref name="rosenberg2006ch1"&gt;{{harvnb|Rosenberg|2006|loc=Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific method employs ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori reasoning]]'' as well as ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' reasoning and the use of [[Bayesian inference]] to measure the validity of a given theory.&lt;ref name="godfreysmith2003ch14"&gt;{{harvnb|Godfrey-Smith|2003|loc=Chapter 14: "Bayesianism and Modern Theories of Evidence"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of physics has answered many questions of early philosophers, but has also raised new questions. Study of the philosophical issues surrounding physics, the philosophy of physics, involves issues such as the nature of [[space]] and [[time]], [[determinism]], and metaphysical outlooks such as [[empiricism]], [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] and [[Philosophical realism|realism]].&lt;ref name="godfreysmith2003ch15"&gt;{{harvnb|Godfrey-Smith|2003|loc=Chapter 15: "Empiricism, Naturalism, and Scientific Realism?"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many physicists have written about the philosophical implications of their work, for instance [[Laplace]], who championed [[causal determinism]],&lt;ref name="laplace1951"&gt;{{harvnb|Laplace|1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Erwin Schrödinger]], who wrote on [[quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref name="schroedinger1983"&gt;{{harvnb|Schrödinger|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schroedinger1995"&gt;{{harvnb|Schrödinger|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mathematical physicist [[Roger Penrose]] had been called a [[Platonism|Platonist]] by [[Stephen Hawking]],&lt;ref name="hawkingpenrose1996p4"&gt;"I think that Roger is a Platonist at heart but he must answer for himself." {{harv|Hawking|Penrose|1996|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; a view Penrose discusses in his book, ''[[The Road to Reality]]''.&lt;ref name="penrose2004"&gt;{{harvnb|Penrose|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawking referred to himself as an "unashamed reductionist" and took issue with Penrose's views.&lt;ref name="penroseshimonycartwrighthawking1997"&gt;{{harvnb|Penrose|Shimony|Cartwright|Hawking|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core theories==
{{further information|Branches of physics|Outline of physics}}
Though physics deals with a wide variety of systems, certain theories are used by all physicists. Each of these theories were experimentally tested numerous times and found to be an adequate approximation of nature. For instance, the theory of [[Classical physics|classical]] mechanics accurately describes the motion of objects, provided they are much larger than [[atom]]s and moving at much less than the [[speed of light]]. These theories continue to be areas of active research today. [[Chaos theory]], a remarkable aspect of classical mechanics was discovered in the 20th century, three centuries after the original formulation of classical mechanics by [[Isaac Newton]] (1642–1727).

These central theories are important tools for research into more specialised topics, and any physicist, regardless of their specialisation, is expected to be literate in them. These include [[classical mechanics]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[thermodynamics]] and [[statistical mechanics]], [[electromagnetism]], and [[special relativity]].

[[Classical mechanics]] is concerned with bodies acted on by [[force]]s and bodies in [[motion (physics)|motion]] and may be divided into [[statics]] (study of the forces on a body or bodies not subject to an acceleration), [[kinematics]] (study of motion without regard to its causes), and [[Analytical dynamics|dynamics]] (study of motion and the forces that affect it); mechanics may also be divided into [[solid mechanics]] and [[fluid mechanics]] (known together as [[continuum mechanics]]), the latter include such branches as [[Fluid statics|hydrostatics]], [[Fluid dynamics|hydrodynamics]], [[aerodynamics]], and [[pneumatics]].

[[Optics]], the study of [[light]], is concerned not only with [[visible light]] but also with [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet radiation]], which exhibit all of the phenomena of visible light except visibility, e.g., reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, dispersion, and polarization of light. [[Heat]] is a form of [[energy]], the internal energy possessed by the particles of which a substance is composed; thermodynamics deals with the relationships between heat and other forms of energy. [[Electricity]] and [[magnetism]] have been studied as a single branch of physics since the intimate connection between them was discovered in the early 19th century; an [[electric current]] gives rise to a [[magnetic field]], and a changing magnetic field induces an electric current. [[Electrostatics]] deals with [[electric charge]]s at rest, [[Classical electromagnetism|electrodynamics]] with moving charges, and [[magnetostatics]] with magnetic poles at rest.

[[File:Solvay conference 1927.jpg|thumb|right|[[Solvay Conference]] of 1927, with prominent physicists such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Max Planck]], [[Hendrik Lorentz]], [[Niels Bohr]], [[Marie Curie]], [[Erwin Schrödinger]] and [[Paul Dirac]]]]

Classical physics is generally concerned with matter and energy on the normal scale of observation, while much of modern physics is concerned with the behavior of matter and energy under extreme conditions or on a very large or very small scale. For example, [[Atomic physics|atomic]] and [[nuclear physics]] studies matter on the smallest scale at which [[chemical element]]s can be identified. The [[Particle physics|physics of elementary particles]] is on an even smaller scale since it is concerned with the most basic units of matter; this branch of physics is also known as high-energy physics because of the extremely high energies necessary to produce many types of particles in [[particle accelerator]]s. On this scale, ordinary, commonsense notions of space, time, matter, and energy are no longer valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tipler|Llewellyn|2003|pp=269, 477, 561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two chief theories of modern physics present a different picture of the concepts of space, time, and matter from that presented by classical physics. Classical mechanics approximates nature as continuous, while [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] is concerned with the discrete nature of many phenomena at the atomic and subatomic level and with the complementary aspects of particles and waves in the description of such phenomena. The [[theory of relativity]] is concerned with the description of phenomena that take place in a [[frame of reference]] that is in motion with respect to an observer; the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]] is concerned with motion in the absence of gravitational fields and the [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]] with motion and its connection with [[gravitation]]. Both quantum theory and the theory of relativity find applications in all areas of modern physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tipler|Llewellyn|2003|pp=1–4, 115, 185–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Difference between classical and modern physics===
[[File:Modernphysicsfields.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|left|The basic domains of physics]]

While physics aims to discover universal laws, its theories lie in explicit domains of applicability. Loosely speaking, the laws of [[classical physics]] accurately describe systems whose important length scales are greater than the atomic scale and whose motions are much slower than the speed of light. Outside of this domain, observations do not match predictions provided by classical mechanics. [[Albert Einstein]] contributed the framework of [[special relativity]], which replaced notions of [[absolute time and space]] with [[spacetime]] and allowed an accurate description of systems whose components have speeds approaching the speed of light. [[Max Planck]], [[Erwin Schrödinger]], and others introduced [[quantum mechanics]], a probabilistic notion of particles and interactions that allowed an accurate description of atomic and subatomic scales. Later, [[quantum field theory]] unified [[quantum mechanics]] and [[special relativity]]. [[General relativity]] allowed for a dynamical, curved [[spacetime]], with which highly massive systems and the large-scale structure of the universe can be well-described. General relativity has not yet been unified with the other fundamental descriptions; several candidate theories of [[quantum gravity]] are being developed.

[[File:Physics and other sciences.png|thumb|left|Mathematics and ontology are used in physics. Physics is used in chemistry and cosmology.]]

===Prerequisites===
Mathematics provides a compact and exact language used to describe the order in nature. This was noted and advocated by [[Pythagoras]],&lt;ref name="dijksterhuis1986"&gt;{{harvnb|Dijksterhuis|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]],&lt;ref name="mastin2010-plato"&gt;"Although usually remembered today as a philosopher, Plato was also one of ancient Greece's most important patrons of mathematics. Inspired by Pythagoras, he founded his Academy in Athens in 387 BC, where he stressed mathematics as a way of understanding more about reality. In particular, he was convinced that geometry was the key to unlocking the secrets of the universe. The sign above the Academy entrance read: 'Let no-one ignorant of geometry enter here.'" {{harv|Mastin|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]],&lt;ref name="toraldodifrancia1976p10-galileo"&gt;"Philosophy is written in that great book which ever lies before our eyes. I mean the universe, but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which it is written. This book is written in the mathematical language, and the symbols are triangles, circles, and other geometrical figures, without whose help it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word of it, and without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth." – [[Galileo]] (1623), ''[[The Assayer]]'', as quoted in {{harvnb|Toraldo Di Francia|1976|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]].

Physics uses mathematics&lt;ref name="applicationsofmathematics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.niu.edu/~rusin/known-math/index/tour_sci.html |title=Applications of Mathematics to the Sciences |date=25 January 2000 |accessdate=30 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510112012/http://www.math.niu.edu/~rusin/known-math/index/tour_sci.html |archive-date=2015-05-10 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; to organise and formulate experimental results. From those results, [[analytic solution|precise]] or [[simulation#Computer simulation|estimated]] solutions are obtained, quantitative results from which new predictions can be made and experimentally confirmed or negated. The results from physics experiments are numerical data, with their [[units of measure]] and [[estimate]]s of the [[error]]s in the [[measurement]]s. Technologies based on mathematics, like [[scientific computing|computation]] have made [[computational physics]] an active area of research.

[[File:Mathematical Physics and other sciences.png|thumb|The distinction between mathematics and physics is clear-cut, but not always obvious, especially in mathematical physics.]]

[[Ontology]] is a prerequisite for physics, but not for mathematics. It means physics is ultimately concerned with descriptions of the real world, while mathematics is concerned with abstract patterns, even beyond the real world. Thus physics statements are synthetic, while mathematical statements are analytic. Mathematics contains hypotheses, while physics contains theories. Mathematics statements have to be only logically true, while predictions of physics statements must match observed and experimental data.

The distinction is clear-cut, but not always obvious. For example, mathematical physics is the application of mathematics in physics. Its methods are mathematical, but its subject is physical.&lt;ref name="jmp-def"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.researchgate.net/journal/0022-2488_Journal_of_Mathematical_Physics | title=Journal of Mathematical Physics | publisher=[[ResearchGate]] | accessdate=31 March 2014 | quote=mathematical physics — that is, the application of mathematics to problems in physics and the development of mathematical methods suitable for such applications and for the formulation of physical theories. | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818231853/http://www.researchgate.net/journal/0022-2488_Journal_of_Mathematical_Physics | archivedate=18 August 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The problems in this field start with a "[[Boundary condition|mathematical model of a physical situation]]" (system) and a "mathematical description of a physical law" that will be applied to that system. Every mathematical statement used for solving has a hard-to-find physical meaning. The final mathematical solution has an easier-to-find meaning, because it is what the solver is looking for.{{clarify|date=August 2015}}

Physics is a branch of [[fundamental science]], not [[practical science]]. Physics is also called "the fundamental science" because the subject of study of all branches of [[natural science]] like chemistry, astronomy, geology, and biology are constrained by laws of physics,&lt;ref name="feynmanleightonsands1963v1ch3"&gt;{{harvnb|Feynman|Leighton|Sands|1963|loc=Chapter 3: "The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences"}}; see also [[reductionism]] and [[special sciences]]&lt;/ref&gt; similar to how chemistry is often called [[the central science]] because of its role in linking the physical sciences. For example, chemistry studies properties, structures, and [[chemical reaction|reactions]] of matter (chemistry's focus on the atomic scale [[Difference between chemistry and physics|distinguishes it from physics]]). Structures are formed because particles exert electrical forces on each other, properties include physical characteristics of given substances, and reactions are bound by laws of physics, like conservation of energy, mass, and charge.

Physics is applied in industries like engineering and medicine.

===Application and influence===
{{Main article|Applied physics}}
[[File:Archimedes-screw one-screw-threads with-ball 3D-view animated small.gif|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Archimedes' screw]], a [[simple machine]] for lifting]]
[[File:IMG 1729 Gemaal met schroef van Archimedes bij Kinderdijk.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|The application of physical laws in lifting liquids]]

[[Applied physics]] is a general term for physics research which is intended for a particular [[Utility|use]]. An applied physics [[curriculum]] usually contains a few classes in an applied discipline, like geology or electrical engineering. It usually differs from [[engineering]] in that an applied physicist may not be designing something in particular, but rather is using physics or conducting physics research with the aim of developing new technologies or solving a problem.

The approach is similar to that of [[applied mathematics]]. Applied physicists use physics in scientific research. For instance, people working on [[accelerator physics]] might seek to build better [[particle detector]]s for research in theoretical physics.

Physics is used heavily in [[engineering]]. For example, [[statics]], a subfield of [[mechanics]], is used in the building of [[bridge]]s and other static structures. The understanding and use of [[acoustics]] results in sound control and better concert halls; similarly, the use of [[optics]] creates better optical devices. An understanding of physics makes for more realistic [[flight simulator]]s, [[video game]]s, and [[Film|movies]], and is often critical in [[forensic]] investigations.

With the [[Uniformitarianism (science)|standard consensus]] that the [[Scientific law|laws]] of physics are universal and do not change with time, physics can be used to study things that would ordinarily be mired in [[uncertainty]]. For example, in the [[History of Earth#Origin of the Earth's core and first atmosphere|study of the origin of the earth]], one can reasonably model earth's [[mass]], [[temperature]], and rate of [[rotation]], as a function of time allowing one to extrapolate forward or backward in time and so predict future or prior events. It also allows for simulations in engineering which drastically speed up the development of a new technology.

But there is also considerable [[interdisciplinarity]] in the physicist's methods, so many other important fields are influenced by physics (e.g., the fields of [[econophysics]] and sociophysics).

==Research==

===Scientific method===
Physicists use [[scientific method|the scientific method]] to test the validity of a [[physical theory]]. By using a methodical approach to compare the implications of a theory with the conclusions drawn from its related [[experiment]]s and observations, physicists are better able to test the validity of a theory in a logical, unbiased, and repeatable way. To that end, experiments are performed and observations are made in order to determine the validity or invalidity of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ellis |first1=G. |last2=Silk |first2=J. |title=Scientific method: Defend the integrity of physics |url=http://www.nature.com/news/scientific-method-defend-the-integrity-of-physics-1.16535 |journal=Nature |date=16 December 2014 |volume=516 |issue=7531 |pages=321–323 |doi=10.1038/516321a |bibcode=2014Natur.516..321E |pmid=25519115 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402134608/http://www.nature.com/news/scientific-method-defend-the-integrity-of-physics-1.16535 |archivedate=2 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[scientific law]] is a concise verbal or mathematical statement of a relation which expresses a fundamental principle of some theory, such as Newton's law of universal gravitation.&lt;ref name="honderich1995pp474-476"&gt;{{harvnb|Honderich|1995|pp=474–476}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory and experiment===
{{Main article|Theoretical physics|Experimental physics}}
[[File:Bruce McCandless II during EVA in 1984.jpg|thumb|right|The [[astronaut]] and [[Earth]] are both in [[free-fall]]]]
[[File:Lightning in Arlington.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lightning]] is an [[electric current]]]]

Theorists seek to develop [[mathematical model]]s that both agree with existing experiments and successfully predict future experimental results, while [[Experimentalism|experimentalists]] devise and perform experiments to test theoretical predictions and explore new phenomena. Although [[theory]] and [[experiment]] are developed separately, they are strongly dependent upon each other. Progress in physics frequently comes about when experimentalists make a discovery that existing theories cannot explain, or when new theories generate experimentally testable [[prediction]]s, which inspire new experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=June 2015 |title=Has theoretical physics moved too far away from experiments? Is the field entering a crisis and, if so, what should we do about it? |url=https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/research/conferences/convergence/roundtable-discussion-questions/has-theoretical-physics-moved-too |publisher=[[Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421064320/http://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/research/conferences/convergence/roundtable-discussion-questions/has-theoretical-physics-moved-too |archive-date=21 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Physicist]]s who work at the interplay of [[theory]] and [[experiment]] are called [[Phenomenology (particle physics)|phenomenologists]], who study complex phenomena observed in experiment and work to relate them to a [[Theory of everything|fundamental theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Phenomenology |url=https://www.mpp.mpg.de/english/research/theory/phenomenologie/index.html |publisher=[[Max Planck Institute for Physics]] |access-date=22 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307105406/https://www.mpp.mpg.de/english/research/theory/phenomenologie/index.html |archive-date=7 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretical physics has historically taken inspiration from philosophy; [[electromagnetism]] was unified this way.{{efn|See, for example, the influence of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Johann Wilhelm Ritter|Ritter]] on [[Hans Christian Ørsted|Ørsted]].}} Beyond the known universe, the field of theoretical physics also deals with hypothetical issues,{{efn|Concepts which are denoted ''hypothetical'' can change with time. For example, the [[atom]] of nineteenth-century physics was denigrated by some, including [[Ernst Mach]]'s critique of [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]'s formulation of [[statistical mechanics]]. By the end of [[World War II]], the atom was no longer deemed hypothetical.}} such as [[Many-worlds interpretation|parallel universes]], a [[multiverse]], and [[higher dimension]]s. Theorists invoke these ideas in hopes of solving particular problems with existing theories. They then explore the consequences of these ideas and work toward making testable predictions.

[[Experiment]]al physics expands, and is expanded by, [[engineering]] and [[technology]]. Experimental physicists involved in [[basic research]] design and perform experiments with equipment such as [[particle accelerator]]s and [[laser]]s, whereas those involved in [[applied research]] often work in industry developing technologies such as [[MRI|magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)]] and [[transistor]]s. [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]] has noted that experimentalists may seek areas which are not well-explored by theorists.&lt;ref name="feynman1965p157-experiment"&gt;"In fact experimenters have a certain individual character. They ... very often do their experiments in a region in which people know the theorist has not made any guesses." {{harv|Feynman|1965|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scope and aims===
[[File:Acceleration components.JPG|thumb|left|Physics involves modeling the natural world with theory, usually quantitative. Here, the path of a particle is modeled with the mathematics of [[calculus]] to explain its behavior: the purview of the branch of physics known as [[mechanics]].]]

Physics covers a wide range of [[phenomenon|phenomena]], from [[elementary particle]]s (such as quarks, neutrinos, and electrons) to the largest [[superclusters]] of galaxies. Included in these phenomena are the most basic objects composing all other things. Therefore, physics is sometimes called the "[[fundamental science]]".&lt;ref name="feynmanleightonsands1963v1ch3" /&gt; Physics aims to describe the various phenomena that occur in nature in terms of simpler phenomena. Thus, physics aims to both connect the things observable to humans to [[root cause]]s, and then connect these causes together.

For example, the [[History of China|ancient Chinese]] observed that certain rocks ([[lodestone]] and [[magnetite]]) were attracted to one another by an invisible force. This effect was later called [[magnetism]], which was first rigorously studied in the 17th century. But even before the Chinese discovered magnetism, the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] knew of other objects such as [[amber]], that when rubbed with fur would cause a similar invisible attraction between the two.&lt;ref name=stewart&gt;{{cite book |last=Stewart |first=J. |year=2001 |title=Intermediate Electromagnetic Theory |page=50 |publisher=[[World Scientific]] |isbn=978-981-02-4471-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also first studied rigorously in the 17th century and came to be called [[electricity]]. Thus, physics had come to understand two observations of nature in terms of some root cause (electricity and magnetism). However, further work in the 19th century revealed that these two forces were just two different aspects of one force—[[electromagnetism]]. This process of "unifying" forces continues today, and electromagnetism and the [[weak nuclear force]] are now considered to be two aspects of the [[electroweak interaction]]. Physics hopes to find an ultimate reason ([[Theory of Everything]]) for why nature is as it is (see section ''[[#Current research|Current research]]'' below for more information).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Weinberg |first=S. |year=1993 |title=Dreams of a Final Theory: The Search for the Fundamental Laws of Nature |publisher=[[Hutchinson Radius]] |isbn=978-0-09-177395-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research fields===
Contemporary research in physics can be broadly divided into [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[particle physics]]; [[condensed matter physics]]; [[atomic, molecular, and optical physics]]; [[astrophysics]]; and [[applied physics]]. Some physics departments also support [[physics education research]] and [[physics outreach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Redish |first=E. |title=Science and Physics Education Homepages |url=http://www.physics.umd.edu/perg/homepages.htm |publisher=[[University of Maryland]] Physics Education Research Group |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728005227/http://www.physics.umd.edu/perg/homepages.htm |archivedate=28 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 20th century, the individual fields of physics have become increasingly [[specialisation of knowledge|specialised]], and today most physicists work in a single field for their entire careers. "Universalists" such as [[Albert Einstein]] (1879–1955) and [[Lev Landau]] (1908–1968), who worked in multiple fields of physics, are now very rare.{{efn|Yet, universalism is encouraged in the culture of physics. For example, the [[World Wide Web]], which was innovated at [[CERN]] by [[Tim Berners-Lee]], was created in service to the computer infrastructure of CERN, and was/is intended for use by physicists worldwide. The same might be said for [[arXiv.org]]}}

The major fields of physics, along with their subfields and the theories and concepts they employ, are shown in the following table.
{{Subfields of physics}}

====Nuclear and particle physics====
{{Main article|Particle physics|Nuclear physics}}
[[File:CMS Higgs-event.jpg|thumb|A simulated event in the CMS detector of the [[Large Hadron Collider]], featuring a possible appearance of the [[Higgs boson]].]]

[[Particle physics]] is the study of the [[elementary particle|elementary]] constituents of [[matter]] and [[energy]] and the [[Fundamental interaction|interactions]] between them.&lt;ref name="aps-dpf"&gt;{{cite web|title=Division of Particles &amp; Fields |url=http://www.aps.org/units/dpf/index.cfm |publisher=American Physical Society |accessdate=18 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829105655/http://www.aps.org/units/dpf/index.cfm |archivedate=29 August 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, particle physicists design and develop the high energy [[particle accelerator|accelerators]],&lt;ref name="halpern2010"&gt;{{harvnb|Halpern|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Particle detector|detectors]],&lt;ref name="grupen1999"&gt;{{harvnb|Grupen|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Computational particle physics|computer programs]]&lt;ref name="walsh2012"&gt;{{harvnb|Walsh|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; necessary for this research. The field is also called "high-energy physics" because many elementary particles do not occur naturally but are created only during high-energy [[collision]]s of other particles.&lt;ref name="iop-hepp"&gt;{{cite web|title=High Energy Particle Physics Group|url=http://www.iop.org/activity/groups/subject/hepp/index.html|publisher=Institute of Physics|accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the interactions of elementary particles and [[Field (physics)|fields]] are described by the [[Standard Model]].&lt;ref name="oerter2006"&gt;{{harvnb|Oerter|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model accounts for the 12 known particles of matter ([[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s) that interact via the [[strong nuclear force|strong]], [[weak nuclear force|weak]], and [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] [[fundamental force]]s.&lt;ref name="oerter2006" /&gt; Dynamics are described in terms of matter particles exchanging [[gauge boson]]s ([[gluon]]s, [[W and Z bosons]], and [[photon]]s, respectively).&lt;ref name="gribbin1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Gribbin|Gribbin|Gribbin|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Standard Model also predicts a particle known as the [[Higgs boson]].&lt;ref name="oerter2006" /&gt; In July 2012 [[CERN]], the European laboratory for particle physics, announced the detection of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson,&lt;ref name="eonr-higgs"&gt;{{cite web |title=CERN experiments observe particle consistent with long-sought Higgs boson |url=http://press-archived.web.cern.ch/press-archived/PressReleases/Releases2012/PR17.12E.html |publisher=[[CERN]] |accessdate=18 October 2012 |date=4 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114084952/http://press-archived.web.cern.ch/press-archived/PressReleases/Releases2012/PR17.12E.html |archivedate=14 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; an integral part of a [[Higgs mechanism]].

[[Nuclear physics]] is the field of physics that studies the constituents and interactions of [[atomic nuclei]]. The most commonly known applications of nuclear physics are [[nuclear power]] generation and [[nuclear weapons]] technology, but the research has provided application in many fields, including those in [[nuclear medicine]] and [[magnetic resonance imaging]], [[ion implantation]] in [[materials engineering]], and [[radiocarbon dating]] in [[geology]] and [[archaeology]].

====Atomic, molecular, and optical physics====
{{Main article|Atomic, molecular, and optical physics}}

[[Atom]]ic, [[Molecule|molecular]], and [[Optics|optical]] physics (AMO) is the study of [[matter]]–matter and [[light]]–matter interactions on the scale of single [[atom]]s and molecules. The three areas are grouped together because of their interrelationships, the similarity of methods used, and the commonality of their relevant [[energy]] scales. All three areas include both [[classical physics|classical]], semi-classical and [[quantum physics|quantum]] treatments; they can treat their subject from a microscopic view (in contrast to a macroscopic view).

[[Atomic physics]] studies the [[electron]] shells of [[atom]]s. Current research focuses on activities in quantum control, cooling and trapping of atoms and ions,&lt;ref&gt;For example, AMO research groups at {{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/physics/research/abcp/areas.html#amo |title=MIT AMO Group |accessdate=21 February 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227043906/http://web.mit.edu/physics/research/abcp/areas.html#amo |archivedate=27 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://physics.korea.ac.kr/research/research_amo.php |title=Korea University, Physics AMO Group |accessdate=21 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301112653/http://physics.korea.ac.kr/research/research_amo.php |archivedate=1 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phys.au.dk/forskning/forskningsomraader/amo/ |title=Aarhus Universitet, AMO Group |accessdate=21 February 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307062146/http://phys.au.dk/forskning/forskningsomraader/amo/ |archivedate=7 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; low-temperature collision dynamics and the effects of electron correlation on structure and dynamics. Atomic physics is influenced by the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] (see, e.g., [[hyperfine splitting]]), but intra-nuclear phenomena such as [[nuclear fission|fission]] and [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] are considered part of [[nuclear physics]].

[[Molecular physics]] focuses on multi-atomic structures and their internal and external interactions with matter and light. [[Optical physics]] is distinct from [[optics]] in that it tends to focus not on the control of classical light fields by macroscopic objects but on the fundamental properties of [[optical field]]s and their interactions with matter in the microscopic realm.

====Condensed matter physics====
{{Main article|Condensed matter physics}}
[[File:Bose Einstein condensate.png|right|thumb|upright=1.6|Velocity-distribution data of a gas of [[rubidium]] atoms, confirming the discovery of a new phase of matter, the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]]]

[[Condensed matter physics]] is the field of physics that deals with the macroscopic physical properties of matter.&lt;ref name="taylorheinonen2002"&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|Heinonen|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it is concerned with the "condensed" [[phase (matter)|phases]] that appear whenever the number of particles in a system is extremely large and the interactions between them are strong.&lt;ref name=cohen2008&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most familiar examples of condensed phases are [[Solid-state physics|solids]] and [[liquid]]s, which arise from the bonding by way of the [[electromagnetic force]] between [[atom]]s.&lt;ref name="moore2011"&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|2011|pp=255–258}}&lt;/ref&gt; More exotic condensed phases include the [[superfluid]]&lt;ref name="leggett1999"&gt;{{harvnb|Leggett|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]&lt;ref name="levy2001"&gt;{{harvnb|Levy|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; found in certain atomic systems at very low [[temperature]], the [[superconductivity|superconducting]] phase exhibited by [[conduction electron]]s in certain materials,&lt;ref name=stajiccoontzosborne2011&gt;{{harvnb|Stajic|Coontz|Osborne|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[ferromagnet]]ic and [[antiferromagnet]]ic phases of [[spin (physics)|spins]] on [[crystal lattice|atomic lattices]].&lt;ref name="mattis2006"&gt;{{harvnb|Mattis|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Condensed matter physics is the largest field of contemporary physics. Historically, condensed matter physics grew out of [[solid-state physics]], which is now considered one of its main subfields.&lt;ref name="aps-dcmp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aps.org/units/dcmp/history.cfm |title=History of Condensed Matter Physics |publisher=[[American Physical Society]] |accessdate=31 March 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912081611/http://www.aps.org/units/dcmp/history.cfm |archivedate=12 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''condensed matter physics'' was apparently coined by [[Philip Warren Anderson|Philip Anderson]] when he renamed his research group—previously ''solid-state theory''—in 1967.&lt;ref name="princeton-anderson"&gt;{{cite web |title=Philip Anderson |url=http://www.princeton.edu/physics/people/display_person.xml?netid=pwa&amp;display=faculty |publisher=[[Princeton University]], Department of Physics |accessdate=15 October 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008123438/http://www.princeton.edu/physics/people/display_person.xml?netid=pwa&amp;display=faculty |archivedate=8 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, the Division of Solid State Physics of the [[American Physical Society]] was renamed as the Division of Condensed Matter Physics.&lt;ref name="aps-dcmp" /&gt; Condensed matter physics has a large overlap with [[chemistry]], [[materials science]], [[nanotechnology]] and [[engineering]].&lt;ref name="cohen2008" /&gt;

====Astrophysics====
{{Main article|Astrophysics|Physical cosmology}}
[[File:Hubble ultra deep field high rez edit1.jpg|thumb|left|The deepest visible-light image of the [[universe]], the [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]]]]

[[Astrophysics]] and [[astronomy]] are the application of the theories and methods of physics to the study of [[stellar structure]], [[stellar evolution]], the origin of the Solar System, and related problems of [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]]. Because astrophysics is a broad subject, astrophysicists typically apply many disciplines of physics, including mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, and atomic and molecular physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://manoa.hawaii.edu/astronomy/bs-in-astrophysics/ |title=BS in Astrophysics |publisher=[[University of Hawaii at Manoa]] |access-date=14 Oct 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404195943/http://manoa.hawaii.edu/astronomy/bs-in-astrophysics/ |archivedate=4 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery by [[Karl Jansky]] in 1931 that radio signals were emitted by celestial bodies initiated the science of [[radio astronomy]]. Most recently, the frontiers of astronomy have been expanded by space exploration. Perturbations and interference from the earth's atmosphere make space-based observations necessary for [[infrared astronomy|infrared]], [[ultraviolet astronomy|ultraviolet]], [[gamma-ray astronomy|gamma-ray]], and [[X-ray astronomy]].

[[Physical cosmology]] is the study of the formation and evolution of the universe on its largest scales. Albert Einstein's theory of relativity plays a central role in all modern cosmological theories. In the early 20th century, [[Edwin Hubble|Hubble]]'s discovery that the universe is expanding, as shown by the [[Hubble diagram]], prompted rival explanations known as the [[steady state theory|steady state]] universe and the [[Big Bang]].

The Big Bang was confirmed by the success of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] and the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background]] in 1964. The Big Bang model rests on two theoretical pillars: Albert Einstein's general relativity and the [[cosmological principle]]. Cosmologists have recently established the [[Lambda-CDM model|ΛCDM model]] of the evolution of the universe, which includes [[cosmic inflation]], [[dark energy]], and [[dark matter]].

Numerous possibilities and discoveries are anticipated to emerge from new data from the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]] over the upcoming decade and vastly revise or clarify existing models of the [[universe]].&lt;ref name="nasa-glast"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/main/questions_answers.html |title=NASA – Q&amp;A on the GLAST Mission |accessdate=29 April 2009 |website=Nasa: Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=28 August 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425121001/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/main/questions_answers.html |archivedate=25 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/science/index.html Nasa – Fermi Science] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403041501/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/science/index.html |date=3 April 2010 }} and [http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/science/unidentified_sources.html NASA – Scientists Predict Major Discoveries for GLAST] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302071338/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/science/unidentified_sources.html |date=2 March 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the potential for a tremendous discovery surrounding dark matter is possible over the next several years.&lt;ref name="nasa-glast-darkmatter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/science/dark_matter.html |title=Dark Matter |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=28 August 2008 |accessdate=30 January 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113060142/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/science/dark_matter.html |archivedate=13 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermi will search for evidence that dark matter is composed of [[weakly interacting massive particle]]s, complementing similar experiments with the [[Large Hadron Collider]] and other underground detectors.

[[IBEX]] is already yielding new [[astrophysical]] discoveries: "No one knows what is creating the [[energetic neutral atom|ENA (energetic neutral atoms)]] ribbon" along the [[termination shock]] of the [[solar wind]], "but everyone agrees that it means the textbook picture of the [[heliosphere]]—in which the Solar System's enveloping pocket filled with the solar wind's charged particles is plowing through the onrushing 'galactic wind' of the interstellar medium in the shape of a comet—is wrong."&lt;ref name="kerr2009"&gt;{{harvnb|Kerr|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in physics is continually progressing on a large number of fronts.

In condensed matter physics, an important unsolved theoretical problem is that of [[high-temperature superconductivity]].&lt;ref name=Legg2006&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Leggett |first1=A.J. |year=2006 |title=What DO we know about high ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;? |url=http://leopard.physics.ucdavis.edu/rts/p242/nphys254.pdf |journal=[[Nature Physics]] |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=134–136 |bibcode=2006NatPh...2..134L |doi=10.1038/nphys254 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610183622/http://leopard.physics.ucdavis.edu/rts/p242/nphys254.pdf |archivedate=10 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many condensed matter experiments are aiming to fabricate workable [[spintronics]] and [[quantum computer]]s.&lt;ref name=cohen2008/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Wolf |first1=S.A. |last2=Chtchelkanova |first2=A.Y. |last3=Treger |first3=D.M. |title=Spintronics—A retrospective and perspective |journal=[[IBM Journal of Research and Development]] |volume=50 |pages=101–110 |year=2006 |doi=10.1147/rd.501.0101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particle physics, the first pieces of experimental evidence for physics beyond the [[Standard Model]] have begun to appear. Foremost among these are indications that [[neutrino]]s have non-zero [[mass]]. These experimental results appear to have solved the long-standing [[solar neutrino problem]], and the physics of massive neutrinos remains an area of active theoretical and experimental research. The [[Large Hadron Collider]] has already found the [[Higgs Boson]], but future research aims to prove or disprove the [[supersymmetry]], which extends the Standard Model of particle physics. Research on the nature of the major mysteries of [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]] is also currently ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gibney |first1=E. |year=2015 |title=LHC 2.0: A new view of the Universe |url=http://www.nature.com/news/lhc-2-0-a-new-view-of-the-universe-1.17081 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=519 |issue=7542 |pages=142–143 |doi=10.1038/519142a |bibcode=2015Natur.519..142G |pmid=25762263 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221231607/http://www.nature.com/news/lhc-2-0-a-new-view-of-the-universe-1.17081 |archivedate=21 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretical attempts to unify [[quantum mechanics]] and [[general relativity]] into a single theory of [[quantum gravity]], a program ongoing for over half a century, have not yet been decisively resolved. The current leading candidates are [[M-theory]], [[superstring theory]] and [[loop quantum gravity]].

Many [[astronomical]] and [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] phenomena have yet to be satisfactorily explained, including the origin of [[GZK paradox|ultra-high energy cosmic rays]], the [[baryon asymmetry]], the [[accelerating universe|acceleration of the universe]] and the [[galaxy rotation problem|anomalous rotation rates of galaxies]].

Although much progress has been made in high-energy, [[quantum]], and astronomical physics, many everyday phenomena involving [[complex systems|complexity]],&lt;ref name="nrc1997v9p161"&gt;{{harvnb|National Research Council|Committee on Technology for Future Naval Forces|1997|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chaos theory|chaos]],&lt;ref name="kellert1993p32"&gt;{{harvnb|Kellert|1993|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[turbulence]]&lt;ref name="eames-quoting-feynman"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eames |first1=I. |last2=Flor |first2=J.B. |year=2011 |title=New developments in understanding interfacial processes in turbulent flows |url=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/369/1937/702 |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A]] |volume=369 |issue=1937 |pages=702–705 |bibcode=2011RSPTA.369..702E |doi=10.1098/rsta.2010.0332 |pmid=21242127 |quote=Richard Feynman said that 'Turbulence is the most important unsolved problem of classical physics' |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817230613/http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/369/1937/702 |archivedate=17 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; are still poorly understood. Complex problems that seem like they could be solved by a clever application of dynamics and mechanics remain unsolved; examples include the formation of sandpiles, nodes in trickling [[water]], the shape of water [[droplet]]s, mechanisms of [[surface tension]] [[catastrophe theory|catastrophes]], and self-sorting in shaken heterogeneous collections.&lt;ref&gt;See the work of [[Ilya Prigogine]], on 'systems far from equilibrium', and others, e.g., {{Cite book |author1=National Research Council |author2=Board on Physics and Astronomy |author3=Committee on CMMP 2010 |year=2010 |chapter=What happens far from equilibrium and why |chapter-url=https://www.nap.edu/read/11967/chapter/7 |title=Condensed-Matter and Materials Physics: the science of the world around us |journal=Condensed-Matter and Materials Physics: The Science of the World Around Us (National Academies Press, Washington, DC |volume=2007 |pages=91–110 |arxiv=1009.4874 |doi=10.17226/11967 |isbn=978-0-309-10969-7 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104001321/https://www.nap.edu/read/11967/chapter/7 |archivedate=4 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These complex phenomena have received growing attention since the 1970s for several reasons, including the availability of modern [[mathematical]] methods and [[computers]], which enabled [[complex systems]] to be modeled in new ways. Complex physics has become part of increasingly [[interdisciplinary]] research, as exemplified by the study of [[turbulence]] in [[aerodynamics]] and the observation of [[pattern formation]] in [[Biology|biological]] systems. In the 1932 ''Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics'', [[Horace Lamb]] said:&lt;ref name="goldstein1969"&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{bquote|I am an old man now, and when I die and go to heaven there are two matters on which I hope for enlightenment. One is quantum electrodynamics, and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids. And about the former I am rather optimistic.}}

{{Short description|Physics of large number of particles' statistical behavior}}
{{Statistical mechanics}}

'''Statistical mechanics''' is one of the pillars of modern [[physics]].  It is necessary for the fundamental study of any physical system that has a large number of [[degrees of freedom]]. The approach is based on [[Statistics|statistical]] methods, [[probability theory]] and the [[Microscopic scale|microscopic]] physical laws.&lt;ref name="gibbs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tolman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="balescu"/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The term ''statistical mechanics'' is sometimes used to refer to only ''statistical thermodynamics''. This article takes the broader view. By some definitions, ''[[statistical physics]]'' is an even broader term which statistically studies any type of physical system, but is often taken to be synonymous with statistical mechanics.&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be used to explain the [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] behaviour of large systems. This branch of statistical mechanics, which treats and extends classical thermodynamics, is known as '''statistical thermodynamics''' or '''equilibrium statistical mechanics'''.

Statistical mechanics shows how the concepts from macroscopic observations (such as temperature and pressure) are related to the description of microscopic state that fluctuates around an average state. It connects thermodynamic quantities (such as [[heat capacity]]) to microscopic behaviour, whereas, in [[classical thermodynamics]], the only available option would be to just measure and tabulate such quantities for various materials.&lt;ref name="gibbs"/&gt;

Statistical mechanics can also be used to study systems that are out of equilibrium. An important subbranch known as '''non-equilibrium statistical mechanics''' deals with the issue of microscopically modelling the speed of [[irreversible process]]es that are driven by imbalances. Examples of such processes include chemical reactions or flows of particles and heat.  The [[fluctuation–dissipation theorem]] is the basic knowledge obtained from applying [[non-equilibrium statistical mechanics]] to study the simplest non-equilibrium situation of a steady state current flow in a system of many particles.

==Principles: mechanics and ensembles==

{{main|Mechanics|Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|l2=Statistical ensemble}}

In physics, there are two types of mechanics usually examined: [[classical mechanics]] and [[quantum mechanics]]. For both types of mechanics, the standard mathematical approach is to consider two concepts:
# The complete state of the mechanical system at a given time, mathematically encoded as a [[phase space|phase point]] (classical mechanics) or a pure [[quantum state vector]] (quantum mechanics).
# An equation of motion which carries the state forward in time: [[Hamilton's equations]] (classical mechanics) or the [[time-dependent Schrödinger equation]] (quantum mechanics)
Using these two concepts, the state at any other time, past or future, can in principle be calculated.
There is however a disconnection between these laws and everyday life experiences, as we do not find it necessary (nor even theoretically possible) to know exactly at a microscopic level the simultaneous positions and velocities of each molecule while carrying out processes at the human scale (for example, when performing a chemical reaction). Statistical mechanics fills this disconnection between the laws of mechanics and the practical experience of incomplete knowledge, by adding some uncertainty about which state the system is in.

Whereas ordinary mechanics only considers the behaviour of a single state, statistical mechanics introduces the [[Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|statistical ensemble]], which is a large collection of virtual, independent copies of the system in various states. The statistical ensemble is a [[probability distribution]] over all possible states of the system. In classical statistical mechanics, the ensemble is a probability distribution over phase points (as opposed to a single phase point in ordinary mechanics), usually represented as a distribution in a [[phase space]] with [[canonical coordinates]]. In quantum statistical mechanics, the ensemble is a probability distribution over pure states,&lt;ref group=note&gt;The probabilities in quantum statistical mechanics should not be confused with [[quantum superposition]]. While a quantum ensemble can contain states with quantum superpositions, a single quantum state cannot be used to represent an ensemble.&lt;/ref&gt; and can be compactly summarized as a [[density matrix]].

As is usual for probabilities, the ensemble can be interpreted in different ways:&lt;ref name="gibbs"/&gt;
* an ensemble can be taken to represent the various possible states that a ''single system'' could be in ([[epistemic probability]], a form of knowledge), or
* the members of the ensemble can be understood as the states of the systems in experiments repeated on independent systems which have been prepared in a similar but imperfectly controlled manner ([[empirical probability]]), in the limit of an infinite number of trials.
These two meanings are equivalent for many purposes, and will be used interchangeably in this article.

However the probability is interpreted, each state in the ensemble evolves over time according to the equation of motion. Thus, the ensemble itself (the probability distribution over states) also evolves, as the virtual systems in the ensemble continually leave one state and enter another. The ensemble evolution is given by the [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville equation]] (classical mechanics) or the [[von Neumann equation]] (quantum mechanics). These equations are simply derived by the application of the mechanical equation of motion separately to each virtual system contained in the ensemble, with the probability of the virtual system being conserved over time as it evolves from state to state.

One special class of ensemble is those ensembles that do not evolve over time. These ensembles are known as ''equilibrium ensembles'' and their condition is known as ''statistical equilibrium''. Statistical equilibrium occurs if, for each state in the ensemble, the ensemble also contains all of its future and past states with probabilities equal to the probability of being in that state.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Statistical equilibrium should not be confused with ''[[mechanical equilibrium]]''. The latter occurs when a mechanical system has completely ceased to evolve even on a microscopic scale, due to being in a state with a perfect balancing of forces. Statistical equilibrium generally involves states that are very far from mechanical equilibrium.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of equilibrium ensembles of isolated systems is the focus of statistical thermodynamics. Non-equilibrium statistical mechanics addresses the more general case of ensembles that change over time, and/or ensembles of non-isolated systems.

==Statistical thermodynamics==

The primary goal of statistical thermodynamics (also known as equilibrium statistical mechanics) is to derive the [[classical thermodynamics]] of materials in terms of the properties of their constituent particles and the interactions between them. In other words, statistical thermodynamics provides a connection between the macroscopic properties of materials in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], and the microscopic behaviours and motions occurring inside the material.

Whereas statistical mechanics proper involves dynamics, here the attention is focussed on ''statistical equilibrium'' (steady state). Statistical equilibrium does not mean that the particles have stopped moving ([[mechanical equilibrium]]), rather, only that the ensemble is not evolving.

===Fundamental postulate===

A [[sufficient condition|sufficient]] (but not necessary) condition for statistical equilibrium with an isolated system is that the probability distribution is a function only of conserved properties (total energy, total particle numbers, etc.).&lt;ref name="gibbs"/&gt;
There are many different equilibrium ensembles that can be considered, and only some of them correspond to thermodynamics.&lt;ref name="gibbs"/&gt; Additional postulates are necessary to motivate why the ensemble for a given system should have one form or another.

A common approach found in many textbooks is to take the ''equal a priori probability postulate''.&lt;ref name="tolman"/&gt; This postulate states that
: ''For an isolated system with an exactly known energy and exactly known composition, the system can be found with ''equal probability'' in any [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]] consistent with that knowledge.''
The equal a priori probability postulate therefore provides a motivation for the [[microcanonical ensemble]] described below. There are various arguments in favour of the equal a priori probability postulate:
* [[Ergodic hypothesis]]: An ergodic system is one that evolves over time to explore "all accessible" states: all those with the same energy and composition. In an ergodic system, the microcanonical ensemble is the only possible equilibrium ensemble with fixed energy. This approach has limited applicability, since most systems are not ergodic.
* [[Principle of indifference]]: In the absence of any further information, we can only assign equal probabilities to each compatible situation.
* [[Maximum entropy thermodynamics|Maximum information entropy]]: A more elaborate version of the principle of indifference states that the correct ensemble is the ensemble that is compatible with the known information and that has the largest [[Gibbs entropy]] ([[information entropy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jaynes| first1 = E.| authorlink1 = Edwin Thompson Jaynes| title = Information Theory and Statistical Mechanics | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.106.620 | journal = Physical Review | volume = 106 | issue = 4 | pages = 620–630 | year = 1957 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1957PhRv..106..620J }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other fundamental postulates for statistical mechanics have also been proposed.&lt;ref name="uffink"/&gt;

===Three thermodynamic ensembles===
{{main|Microcanonical ensemble|Canonical ensemble|Grand canonical ensemble}}

There are three equilibrium ensembles with a simple form that can be defined for any [[isolated system]] bounded inside a finite volume.&lt;ref name="gibbs"/&gt; These are the most often discussed ensembles in statistical thermodynamics. In the macroscopic limit (defined below) they all correspond to classical thermodynamics.
; [[Microcanonical ensemble]]
: describes a system with a precisely given energy and fixed composition (precise number of particles). The microcanonical ensemble contains with equal probability each possible state that is consistent with that energy and composition.
; [[Canonical ensemble]]
: describes a system of fixed composition that is in [[thermal equilibrium]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;The transitive thermal equilibrium (as in, "X is thermal equilibrium with Y") used here means that the ensemble for the first system is not perturbed when the system is allowed to weakly interact with the second system.&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[heat bath]] of a precise [[thermodynamic temperature|temperature]]. The canonical ensemble contains states of varying energy but identical composition; the different states in the ensemble are accorded different probabilities depending on their total energy.
; [[Grand canonical ensemble]]
: describes a system with non-fixed composition (uncertain particle numbers) that is in thermal and chemical equilibrium with a thermodynamic reservoir. The reservoir has a precise temperature, and precise [[chemical potential]]s for various types of particle. The grand canonical ensemble contains states of varying energy and varying numbers of particles; the different states in the ensemble are accorded different probabilities depending on their total energy and total particle numbers.

For systems containing many particles (the [[thermodynamic limit]]), all three of the ensembles listed above tend to give identical behaviour. It is then simply a matter of mathematical convenience which ensemble is used.&lt;ref name="Reif"&gt;{{cite book | last = Reif | first = F. | title = Fundamentals of Statistical and Thermal Physics| publisher = McGraw–Hill | year = 1965 |isbn =9780070518001|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gibbs theorem about equivalence of ensembles&lt;ref&gt;Touchette, H.

Important cases where the thermodynamic ensembles ''do not'' give identical results include:
* Microscopic systems.
* Large systems at a phase transition.
* Large systems with long-range interactions.
In these cases the correct thermodynamic ensemble must be chosen as there are observable differences between these ensembles not just in the size of fluctuations, but also in average quantities such as the distribution of particles. The correct ensemble is that which corresponds to the way the system has been prepared and characterized—in other words, the ensemble that reflects the knowledge about that system.&lt;ref name="tolman"/&gt;

===Calculation methods===

Once the characteristic state function for an ensemble has been calculated for a given system, that system is 'solved' (macroscopic observables can be extracted from the characteristic state function). Calculating the characteristic state function of a thermodynamic ensemble is not necessarily a simple task, however, since it involves considering every possible state of the system. While some hypothetical systems have been exactly solved, the most general (and realistic) case is too complex for an exact solution. Various approaches exist to approximate the true ensemble and allow calculation of average quantities.

====Exact====

There are some cases which allow exact solutions.

* For very small microscopic systems, the ensembles can be directly computed by simply enumerating over all possible states of the system (using exact diagonalization in quantum mechanics, or integral over all phase space in classical mechanics).
* Some large systems consist of many separable microscopic systems, and each of the subsystems can be analysed independently. Notably, idealized gases of non-interacting particles have this property, allowing exact derivations of [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics]], [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]], and [[Bose–Einstein statistics]].&lt;ref name="tolman"/&gt;
* A few large systems with interaction have been solved. By the use of subtle mathematical techniques, exact solutions have been found for a few [[toy model]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 9780120831807 | title = Exactly solved models in statistical mechanics | last1 = Baxter | first1 = Rodney J. | year = 1982 | publisher = Academic Press Inc.  | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples include the [[Bethe ansatz]], [[square-lattice Ising model]] in zero field, [[hard hexagon model]].

====Monte Carlo====

{{main|Monte Carlo method}}

One approximate approach that is particularly well suited to computers is the [[Monte Carlo method]], which examines just a few of the possible states of the system, with the states chosen randomly (with a fair weight). As long as these states form a representative sample of the whole set of states of the system, the approximate characteristic function is obtained. As more and more random samples are included, the errors are reduced to an arbitrarily low level.

* The [[Metropolis–Hastings algorithm]] is a classic Monte Carlo method which was initially used to sample the canonical ensemble.
* [[Path integral Monte Carlo]], also used to sample the canonical ensemble.

====Other====

* For rarefied non-ideal gases, approaches such as the [[cluster expansion]] use [[perturbation theory]] to include the effect of weak interactions, leading to a [[virial expansion]].&lt;ref name="balescu"/&gt;
* For dense fluids, another approximate approach is based on reduced distribution functions, in particular the [[radial distribution function]].&lt;ref name="balescu"/&gt;
* [[Molecular dynamics]] computer simulations can be used to calculate [[microcanonical ensemble]] averages, in ergodic systems. With the inclusion of a connection to a stochastic heat bath, they can also model canonical and grand canonical conditions.
* Mixed methods involving non-equilibrium statistical mechanical results (see below) may be useful.

==Non-equilibrium statistical mechanics==

{{see also|Non-equilibrium thermodynamics}}

There are many physical phenomena of interest that involve quasi-thermodynamic processes out of equilibrium, for example:
* [[Thermal conduction|heat transport by the internal motions in a material]], driven by a temperature imbalance,
* [[Electrical conduction|electric currents carried by the motion of charges in a conductor]], driven by a voltage imbalance,
* spontaneous [[chemical reaction]]s driven by a decrease in free energy,
* [[friction]], [[dissipation]], [[quantum decoherence]],
* systems being pumped by external forces ([[optical pumping]], etc.),
* and irreversible processes in general.
All of these processes occur over time with characteristic rates, and these rates are of importance for engineering. The field of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics is concerned with understanding these non-equilibrium processes at the microscopic level. (Statistical thermodynamics can only be used to calculate the final result, after the external imbalances have been removed and the ensemble has settled back down to equilibrium.)

In principle, non-equilibrium statistical mechanics could be mathematically exact: ensembles for an isolated system evolve over time according to deterministic equations such as [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's equation]] or its quantum equivalent, the [[von Neumann equation]]. These equations are the result of applying the mechanical equations of motion independently to each state in the ensemble. Unfortunately, these ensemble evolution equations inherit much of the complexity of the underlying mechanical motion, and so exact solutions are very difficult to obtain. Moreover, the ensemble evolution equations are fully reversible and do not destroy information (the ensemble's [[Gibbs entropy]] is preserved). In order to make headway in modelling irreversible processes, it is necessary to consider additional factors besides probability and reversible mechanics.

Non-equilibrium mechanics is therefore an active area of theoretical research as the range of validity of these additional assumptions continues to be explored. A few approaches are described in the following subsections.

=== Stochastic methods ===

One approach to non-equilibrium statistical mechanics is to incorporate [[stochastic]] (random) behaviour into the system. Stochastic behaviour destroys information contained in the ensemble. While this is technically inaccurate (aside from [[Black hole information paradox|hypothetical situations involving black holes]], a system cannot in itself cause loss of information), the randomness is added to reflect that information of interest becomes converted over time into subtle correlations within the system, or to correlations between the system and environment. These correlations appear as [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] or [[pseudorandom]] influences on the variables of interest. By replacing these correlations with randomness proper, the calculations can be made much easier.

{{unordered list
|1= ''[[Boltzmann transport equation]]'': An early form of stochastic mechanics appeared even before the term "statistical mechanics" had been coined, in studies of [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]]. [[James Clerk Maxwell]] had demonstrated that molecular collisions would lead to apparently chaotic motion inside a gas. [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] subsequently showed that, by taking this [[molecular chaos]] for granted as a complete randomization, the motions of particles in a gas would follow a simple [[Boltzmann transport equation]] that would rapidly restore a gas to an equilibrium state (see [[H-theorem]]).

The [[Boltzmann transport equation]] and related approaches are important tools in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics due to their extreme simplicity. These approximations work well in systems where the "interesting" information is immediately (after just one collision) scrambled up into subtle correlations, which essentially restricts them to rarefied gases. The Boltzmann transport equation has been found to be very useful in simulations of electron transport in lightly doped [[semiconductor]]s (in [[transistor]]s), where the electrons are indeed analogous to a rarefied gas.

A quantum technique related in theme is the [[random phase approximation]].

|2= ''[[BBGKY hierarchy]]'':
In liquids and dense gases, it is not valid to immediately discard the correlations between particles after one collision. The [[BBGKY hierarchy]] (Bogoliubov–Born–Green–Kirkwood–Yvon hierarchy) gives a method for deriving Boltzmann-type equations but also extending them beyond the dilute gas case, to include correlations after a few collisions.

|3= ''[[Keldysh formalism]]'' (a.k.a. NEGF—non-equilibrium Green functions):
A quantum approach to including stochastic dynamics is found in the Keldysh formalism. This approach often used in electronic [[quantum transport]] calculations.
}}

=== Near-equilibrium methods ===

Another important class of non-equilibrium statistical mechanical models deals with systems that are only very slightly perturbed from equilibrium. With very small perturbations, the response can be analysed in [[linear response theory]]. A remarkable result, as formalized by the [[fluctuation-dissipation theorem]], is that the response of a system when near equilibrium is precisely related to the [[Statistical fluctuations|fluctuations]] that occur when the system is in total equilibrium. Essentially, a system that is slightly away from equilibrium—whether put there by external forces or by fluctuations—relaxes towards equilibrium in the same way, since the system cannot tell the difference or "know" how it came to be away from equilibrium.&lt;ref name="balescu"/&gt;{{rp|664}}

This provides an indirect avenue for obtaining numbers such as [[Ohm's law|ohmic conductivity]] and [[thermal conductivity]] by extracting results from equilibrium statistical mechanics. Since equilibrium statistical mechanics is mathematically well defined and (in some cases) more amenable for calculations, the fluctuation-dissipation connection can be a convenient shortcut for calculations in near-equilibrium statistical mechanics.

A few of the theoretical tools used to make this connection include:
* [[Fluctuation–dissipation theorem]]
* [[Onsager reciprocal relations]]
* [[Green–Kubo relations]]
* [[Ballistic conduction#Landauer-Büttiker formalism|Landauer–Büttiker formalism]]
* [[Mori–Zwanzig formalism]]

=== Hybrid methods ===

An advanced approach uses a combination of stochastic methods and linear response theory. As an example, one approach to compute quantum coherence effects ([[weak localization]], [[conductance fluctuations]]) in the conductance of an electronic system is the use of the Green-Kubo relations, with the inclusion of stochastic [[dephasing]] by interactions between various electrons by use of the Keldysh method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Altshuler | first1 = B.

==Applications outside thermodynamics==

The ensemble formalism also can be used to analyze general mechanical systems with uncertainty in knowledge about the state of a system. Ensembles are also used in:
* [[propagation of uncertainty]] over time,&lt;ref name="gibbs"/&gt;
* [[regression analysis]] of gravitational [[orbit]]s,
* [[ensemble forecasting]] of weather,
* dynamics of [[neural networks]],
* bounded-rational [[potential game]]s in game theory and economics.

==History==

In 1738, Swiss physicist and mathematician [[Daniel Bernoulli]] published ''Hydrodynamica'' which laid the basis for the [[kinetic theory of gases]]. In this work, Bernoulli posited the argument, still used to this day, that gases consist of great numbers of molecules moving in all directions, that their impact on a surface causes the gas pressure that we feel, and that what we experience as [[heat]] is simply the kinetic energy of their motion.&lt;ref name="uffink"/&gt;

In 1859, after reading a paper on the diffusion of molecules by [[Rudolf Clausius]], Scottish physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] formulated the [[Maxwell distribution]] of molecular velocities, which gave the proportion of molecules having a certain velocity in a specific range.&lt;ref&gt;See:

Statistical mechanics proper was initiated in the 1870s with the work of Boltzmann, much of which was collectively published in his 1896 ''Lectures on Gas Theory''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Statistical Thermodynamics and Stochastic Theory of Nonequilibrium Systems |journal=Statistical Thermodynamics and Stochastic Theory of Nonequilibrium Systems.

Boltzmann introduced the concept of an equilibrium statistical ensemble and also investigated for the first time non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, with his [[H-theorem|''H''-theorem]].

The term "statistical mechanics" was coined by the American mathematical physicist [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|J. Willard Gibbs]] in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Gibbs, "On the Fundamental Formula of Statistical Mechanics, with Applications to Astronomy and Thermodynamics." Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, '''33''', 57-58 (1884). Reproduced in ''The Scientific Papers of J. Willard Gibbs, Vol II'' (1906), [https://archive.org/stream/scientificpapers02gibbuoft#page/16/mode/2up pp.&amp;nbsp;16].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;According to Gibbs, the term "statistical", in the context of mechanics, i.e. statistical mechanics, was first used by the Scottish physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1871. From: J. Clerk Maxwell, ''Theory of Heat'' (London, England: Longmans, Green, and Co., 1871), [https://books.google.com/books?id=DqAAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA309 p. 309:] "In dealing with masses of matter, while we do not perceive the individual molecules, we are compelled to adopt what I have described as the statistical method of calculation, and to abandon the strict dynamical method, in which we follow every motion by the calculus."&lt;/ref&gt; "Probabilistic mechanics" might today seem a more appropriate term, but "statistical mechanics" is firmly entrenched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The enigma of probability and physics |last=Mayants |first=Lazar |year=1984 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-90-277-1674-3 |page=174 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zmwEfXUdBJ8C&amp;pg=PA174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before his death, Gibbs published in 1902 ''[[Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics]]'', a book which formalized statistical mechanics as a fully general approach to address all mechanical systems—macroscopic or microscopic, gaseous or non-gaseous.&lt;ref name="gibbs"/&gt; Gibbs' methods were initially derived in the framework [[classical mechanics]], however they were of such generality that they were found to adapt easily to the later [[quantum mechanics]], and still form the foundation of statistical mechanics to this day.&lt;ref name="tolman"/&gt;

'''Phase stretch transform''' ('''PST''') is a computational approach to signal and image processing. One of its utilities is for feature detection and classification.&lt;ref name="original"&gt;M. H. Asghari, and B. Jalali, "Edge detection in digital images using dispersive phase stretch", International Journal of Biomedical Imaging, Vol. 2015, Article ID 687819, pp. 1–6 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Asghari, and B. Jalali, "Physics-inspired image edge detection", IEEE Global Signal and Information Processing Symposium (GlobalSIP 2014), paper: WdBD-L.1, Atlanta, December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; PST is related to [[time stretch dispersive Fourier transform]].&lt;ref&gt;Y. Han and B. Jalali, "Photonic time-stretched analog-to-digital converter: fundamental concepts and practical considerations", Journal of Lightwave Technology 21, 3085 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; It transforms the image by emulating propagation through a diffractive medium with engineered 3D dispersive property (refractive index). The operation relies on symmetry of the dispersion profile and can be understood in terms of dispersive eigenfunctions or stretch modes.&lt;ref name="prec"&gt;B. Jalali and A. Mahjoubfar, "Tailoring Wideband Signals With a Photonic Hardware Accelerator", Proceedings of the IEEE, Vol. 103, No. 7, pp. 1071–1086 (2015).
&lt;/ref&gt; PST performs similar functionality as [[phase-contrast microscopy]], but on digital images. PST can be applied to digital images and temporal (time series) data.

==Operation principle==
Here the principle is described in the context of feature enhancement in digital images. The image is first filtered with a spatial kernel followed by application of a nonlinear frequency-dependent phase. The output of the transform is the phase in the spatial domain. The main step is the 2-D phase function which is typically applied in the frequency domain. The amount of phase applied to the image is frequency dependent, with higher amount of phase applied to higher frequency features of the image. Since sharp transitions, such as edges and corners, contain higher frequencies, PST emphasizes the edge information. Features can be further enhanced by applying [[thresholding (image processing)|thresholding]] and [[morphological operations]]. PST is related to warped or [[anamorphic stretch transform]], another computational algorithm inspired by optical physics that performs nonuniform sampling and sparse coding.

==Physical and mathematical foundations of Phase Stretch Transform==
Photonic time stretch technique can be understood by considering the propagation of an optical pulse through a dispersive fiber. By disregarding the loss and non-linearity in fiber, the non-linear Schrodinger equation governing the optical pulse propagation in fiber upon integration &lt;ref name="agarwal"&gt;Agrawal, G. P. (2007). Nonlinear fiber optics. Academic press. Chicago.
&lt;/ref&gt; reduces to: 
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;E_o(z,t)= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\tilde{E}_i(0,\omega) \cdot e^\frac{-j\beta_2z\omega^2}{2} \cdot e^{j\omega{t}} d\omega&lt;/math&gt;  (1)

where &lt;math&gt;\beta_2&lt;/math&gt; =GVD parameter, z is propagation distance, &lt;math&gt;E_o(z,t)&lt;/math&gt; is the reshaped output pulse at distance z and time t. The response of this dispersive element in the time-stretch system can be approximated as a phase propagator as presented in &lt;ref name="prec"&gt;B. Jalali and A. Mahjoubfar, "Tailoring Wideband Signals With a Photonic Hardware Accelerator", Proceedings of the IEEE, Vol. 103, No. 7, pp. 1071–1086 (2015).
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;math&gt;H(\omega)=e^{i\phi(\omega)}=e^{i\sum_{m=0}^\infty \phi_m(\omega)}= \prod_{m=0}^\infty H_m(\omega)&lt;/math&gt;  (2)
&lt;br&gt;
Therefore, Eq. 1 can be written as following for a pulse that propagates through the time-stretch system and is reshaped into a temporal signal with a complex envelope given by &lt;ref name="prec"&gt;B. Jalali and A. Mahjoubfar, "Tailoring Wideband Signals With a Photonic Hardware Accelerator", Proceedings of the IEEE, Vol. 103, No. 7, pp. 1071–1086 (2015).
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;E_o(t)= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\tilde{E}_i(\omega)\cdot  H(\omega) \cdot  e^{j\omega{t}} d\omega&lt;/math&gt;  (3)
&lt;br&gt;
The time stretch operation is formulated as generalized phase and amplitude operations,
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{S}\{E_i(t)\}=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\mathcal{F}\{E_i(t)\} \cdot e^{j\phi(\omega)} \cdot \tilde{L}(\omega) \cdot e^{j\omega{t}} d\omega&lt;/math&gt;   (4)
&lt;br&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e^{j\phi(\omega)}&lt;/math&gt; is the phase filter and &lt;math&gt; \tilde{L}(\omega) &lt;/math&gt;is the amplitude filter. Next the operator is converted to discrete domain, 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\mathbb{S}\{E_i[n]\}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{u=0}^{N-1}FFT\{E_i(n)\} \cdot \tilde{K}(u) \cdot \tilde{L}(u) \cdot e^{j\frac{2\pi}{N}un}   
&lt;/math&gt;    (5)
&lt;br&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt; is the discrete frequency, &lt;math&gt;\tilde{K}(u)&lt;/math&gt;  is the phase filter, &lt;math&gt;\tilde{L}(u)&lt;/math&gt;  is the amplitude filter and FFT is Fast Fourier Transform. 

The Stretch operator &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{S} \{ \}&lt;/math&gt;  for a digital image is then 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\mathbb{S}\{E_i[n,m]\}=\frac{1}{MN}\sum_{v=0}^{N-1}\sum_{u=0}^{M-1}FFT^2\{E_i(n,m)\} \cdot \tilde{K}(u,v) \cdot \tilde{L}(u,v) \cdot e^{j\frac{2\pi}{M}um} \cdot e^{j\frac{2\pi}{N}vn}   
&lt;/math&gt;    (6)
&lt;br&gt;

In the above equations, &lt;math&gt;E_i[n,m]&lt;/math&gt; is the input image, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; are the spatial variables, &lt;math&gt;FFT^2&lt;/math&gt;  is the two dimensional Fast Fourier Transform, and &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; are spatial frequency variables. The function &lt;math&gt;\tilde{K}(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; is the warped phase kernel and the function &lt;math&gt;\tilde{L}(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; is a localization kernel implemented in frequency domain. PST operator is defined as the phase of the Warped Stretch Transform output as follows 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
PST\{E_i[n,m]\}\triangleq \measuredangle \{\mathbb{S}\{E_i[x,y]\}\}
&lt;/math&gt;    (7)
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\measuredangle \{ \} &lt;/math&gt;is the angle operator. 


==Applications==
PST has been used for [[edge detection]] in biological and biomedical images as well as [[synthetic-aperture radar]] (SAR) image processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abdol|first=A.M.|last2=Bedard|first2=Andrew|last3=Lánský|first3=Imke|last4=Kaandorp|first4=J.A.|date=2018|title=High-throughput method for extracting and visualizing the spatial gene expressions from in situ hybridization images: A case study of the early development of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis|journal=Gene Expression Patterns|volume=27|pages=36–45|doi=10.1016/j.gep.2017.10.005|pmid=29122675|issn=1567-133X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.

Soraghan, "Synthetic aperture radar image compression using discrete anamorphic stretch transform", IEEE Global Signal and Information Processing Symposium (GlobalSIP 2014), paper: WsBD-P.7, Atlanta, December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;	C. V. Ilioudis, C. Clemente, M. H. Asghari, B. Jalali, and J. Soraghan, "Edge detection in SAR images using Dispersive Phase Stretch Transform", submitted to 2nd IET International Conference on Intelligent Signal Processing, London, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; PST has also been applied to improve the point spread function for single molecule imaging in order to achieve super-resolution.&lt;ref&gt;T. Ilovitsh, B. Jalali, M. H. Asghari, and Z. Zalevsky, "Phase stretch transform for super-resolution localization microscopy", Biomedical optics express. 2016 Oct 1;7(10):4198-209.&lt;/ref&gt; The transform exhibits intrinsic superior properties compared to conventional edge detectors for feature detection in low contrast visually impaired images.&lt;ref&gt;M. Suthar, H. Asghari, and B. Jalali, "Feature Enhancement in Visually Impaired Images", IEEE Access 6 (2018): 1407-1415.&lt;/ref&gt;

The PST function can also be performed on 1-D temporal waveforms in the analog domain to reveal transitions and anomalies in real time.&lt;ref name="prec"/&gt;

==Open source code release==
On February 9, 2016, a UCLA Engineering research group has made public the computer code for PST algorithm that helps computers process images at high speeds and "see" them in ways that human eyes cannot. The researchers say the code could eventually be used in [[facial recognition system|face]], [[fingerprint]], and [[iris recognition]] systems for high-tech security, as well as in self-driving cars' navigation systems or for inspecting industrial products.
Matlab and Python implementation for PST is available for free download from our Github Repository&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/JalaliLabUCLA/Image-feature-detection-using-Phase-Stretch-Transform|title=GitHub - JalaliLabUCLA/Image-feature-detection-using-Phase-Stretch-Transform|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The Matlab implementation for PST can also be downloaded from Matlab Files Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/55330-jalalilabucla-image-feature-detection-using-phase-stretch-transform|title=JalaliLabUCLA/Image-feature-detection-using-Phase-Stretch-Transform – File Exchange – MATLAB Central|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is provided for research purposes only, and a license must be obtained for any commercial applications. The software is protected under a US patent.

[[File:Wigner.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Eugene Wigner]] (1902–1995)]]
In [[theoretical physics]], the composition of two non-[[collinear]] [[Lorentz boost]]s results in a [[Lorentz transformation]] that is not a pure boost but is the composition of a boost and a rotation. This rotation is called '''Thomas rotation''', '''Thomas–Wigner rotation''' or '''Wigner rotation'''. The rotation was discovered by [[Llewellyn Thomas]] in 1926,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; and derived by Wigner in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wigner|1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a sequence of non-collinear boosts returns an object to its initial  velocity, then the sequence of Wigner rotations can combine to produce a net rotation called the [[Thomas precession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rhodes|Semon|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are still ongoing discussions about the correct form of equations for the Thomas rotation in different reference systems with contradicting results.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rebilas|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert Goldstein|Goldstein]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''The spatial rotation resulting from the successive application of two non-collinear Lorentz transformations have been declared every bit as paradoxical as the more frequently discussed apparent violations of common sense, such as the [[twin paradox]].''
Einstein's principle of velocity reciprocity (EPVR) reads&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Einstein|1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''We postulate that the relation between the coordinates of the two systems is linear. Then the inverse transformation is also linear and the complete non-preference of the one or the other system demands that the transformation shall be identical with the original one, except for a change of {{mvar|v}} to {{math|−v}}''
With less careful interpretation, the EPVR is seemingly violated in some models.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mocanu|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, of course, no true paradox present.

===Two general boosts===
When studying the Thomas rotation at the fundamental level, one typically uses a setup with three coordinate frames, {{math|Σ, Σ&amp;prime; Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}}. Frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}} has velocity {{math|'''u'''}} relative to frame {{math|Σ}}, and frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} has velocity {{math|'''v'''}} relative to frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}}.

The axes are, by construction, oriented as follows. Viewed from {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}}, the axes of {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}} and {{math|Σ}} are parallel (the same holds true for the pair of frames when viewed from {{math|Σ}}.) Also viewed from {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}}, the spatial axes of {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}} and {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} are parallel (and the same holds true for the pair of frames when viewed from {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}}.)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ungar|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an application of EVPR: If {{math|'''u'''}} is the velocity of {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}} relative to {{math|Σ}}, then {{math|'''u'''&amp;prime; {{=}} −'''u'''}} is the velocity of {{math|Σ}} relative to {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}}. The velocity {{nowrap|{{math|3}}-vector}} {{math|'''u'''}} makes the ''same'' angles with respect to coordinate axes in both the primed and unprimed systems. This does ''not'' represent a snapshot taken in any of the two frames of the combined system at any particular time, as should be clear from the detailed description below.

This is possible, since a boost in, say, the positive {{nowrap|{{math|''z''}}-direction}}, preserves orthogonality of the coordinate axes. A general boost {{math|''B''('''w''')}} can be expressed as {{math|''L'' {{=}} ''R''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''w''')''B''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;('''w''')''R''('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''w''')}}, where {{math|''R''('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''w''')}} is a rotation taking the {{nowrap|{{math|''z''}}-axis}} into the direction of {{math|'''w'''}} and {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a boost in the new {{nowrap|{{math|''z''}}-direction}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weinberg|2002|pp=68&amp;ndash;69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cushing|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sard|1970|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each rotation retains the property that the spatial coordinate axes are orthogonal. The boost will stretch the (intermediate) {{nowrap|{{math|''z''}}-axis}} by a factor {{mvar|γ}}, while leaving the {{nowrap|intermediate {{math|''x''}}-axis}} and {{nowrap|{{math|''y''}}-axis}} in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ben-Menahem|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that coordinate axes are non-parallel in this construction after ''two'' consecutive non-collinear boosts is a precise expression of the phenomenon of Thomas precession.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This preservation of orthogonality of ''coordinate axes'' should not be confused with preservation of angles between spacelike vectors taken at one and the same time in one system, which, of course, does not hold. The coordinate axes transform under the ''passive'' transformation presented, while the vectors transform under the corresponding ''active'' transformation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The velocity of {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} as seen in {{math|Σ}} is denoted {{math|'''w'''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} '''u''' ⊕ '''v'''}}, where ⊕ refers to the [[velocity addition formula|relativistic addition of velocity]] (and not ordinary [[vector addition]]), given by&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ungar|1988|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \oplus \mathbf v = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{\mathbf u \cdot \mathbf v}{c^2}} \left[\left(1 + 
\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\gamma_\mathbf{u}}{1+\gamma_\mathbf{u}} \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf v \right)\mathbf u +
\frac{1}{\gamma_\mathbf{u}} \mathbf v \right],&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|VA 2}}}}

and

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma_\mathbf{u} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{|\mathbf{u}|^2}{c^2} } }&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[Lorentz factor]] of the velocity {{math|'''u'''}} (the vertical bars {{math|{{abs|'''u'''}}}} indicate the [[Norm (mathematics)|magnitude of the vector]]). The velocity {{math|'''u'''}} can be thought of the velocity of a frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}} relative to a frame {{math|Σ}}, and {{math|'''v'''}} is the velocity of an object, say a particle or ''another frame'' {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} relative to {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}}. In the present context, all velocities are best thought of as relative velocities of frames unless otherwise specified. The result {{math|'''w''' {{=}} '''u''' ⊕ '''v'''}} is then the relative velocity of frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} relative to a frame {{math|Σ}}.

Although velocity addition is [[nonlinear]], non-[[associative property|associative]], and non-[[commutative property|commutative]], the result of the operation correctly obtains a velocity with a magnitude less than {{math|''c''}}. If ordinary vector addition was used, it would be possible to obtain a velocity with a magnitude larger than {{math|''c''}}. The [[Lorentz factor]] {{math|''γ''}} of both composite velocities are equal,

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \gamma_{\mathbf {u} \oplus \mathbf{v}} = \gamma_{\mathbf {v} \oplus \mathbf{u}} = \gamma_\mathbf{u} \gamma_\mathbf{v}\left(1+ \frac{\mathbf {u} \cdot \mathbf {v} }{c^2}\right) \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and the [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]s are equal under interchange of velocity vectors

:&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf u \oplus \mathbf v| = |\mathbf v \oplus \mathbf u| = \frac{c}{\gamma}\sqrt{\gamma^2 - 1} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Since the two possible composite velocities have equal magnitude, but different directions, one must be a rotated copy of the other. More detail and other properties of no direct concern here can be found in the main article.

===Reversed configuration===
Consider the reversed configuration, namely, frame {{math|Σ}} moves with velocity {{math|−'''u'''}} relative to frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}}, and frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}}, in turn, moves with velocity {{math|−'''v'''}} relative to frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}}. In short, {{math|'''u''' → − '''u'''}} and {{math|'''v''' → −'''v'''}} by EPVR. Then the velocity of {{math|Σ}} relative to {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} is {{math|(−'''v''') ⊕ (−'''u''') ≡ −'''v''' ⊕ '''u'''}}. By EPVR again, the velocity of {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} relative to {{math|Σ}} is then {{math|'''w'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} '''v''' ⊕ '''u'''}}. {{EquationRef|(A)}}

One finds {{math|'''w'''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ '''w'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. While they are equal in magnitude, there is an angle between them. For a single boost between two inertial frames, there is only one unambiguous relative velocity (or its negative). For two boosts, the peculiar result of ''two'' inequivalent relative velocities instead of one seems to contradict the symmetry of relative motion between any two frames. Which is the correct velocity of {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} relative to {{math|Σ}}? Since this inequality may be somewhat unexpected and potentially breaking EPVR, this question is warranted.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This is sometimes called the "Mocanu paradox". Mocanu himself didn't name it a paradox, but rather a "difficulty" within the framework of relativistic electrodynamics in a 1986 paper. He was also quick to acknowledge that the problem is explained by Thomas precession {{harvtxt|Mocanu|1992}}, but the name lingers on.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lorentz boosts and Thomas rotation 4.svg|310px|thumb|Inverse of exchanged configuration.]]

===Two boosts equals a boost and rotation===
The answer to the question lies in the Thomas rotation, and that one must be careful in specifying which coordinate system is involved at each step. When viewed from {{math|Σ}}, the coordinate axes of {{math|Σ}} and {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} are ''not'' parallel. While this can be hard to imagine since both pairs {{math|(Σ, Σ&amp;prime;)}} and {{math|(Σ&amp;prime;, Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;)}} have parallel coordinate axes, it is easy to explain mathematically.

Velocity addition does not provide a complete description of the relation between the frames. One must formulate the complete description in terms of [[Lorentz transformation]]s corresponding to the velocities. A Lorentz boost with any velocity {{math|'''v'''}} (magnitude less than {{math|''c''}}) is given symbolically by

:&lt;math&gt;X' = B(\mathbf{v})X&lt;/math&gt;

where the coordinates and transformation matrix are compactly expressed in [[block matrix]] form

:&lt;math&gt;X' = \begin{bmatrix} c t' \\ \mathbf{r}' \end{bmatrix} \quad B(\mathbf{v}) = \begin{bmatrix} \gamma_\mathbf{v} &amp; - \dfrac{\gamma_\mathbf{v}}{c}\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{T} \\ -\dfrac{\gamma_\mathbf{v}}{c}\mathbf{v} &amp; \mathbf{I} + \dfrac{\gamma_\mathbf{v}^2}{\gamma_\mathbf{v}+1} \dfrac{\mathbf{vv}^\mathrm{T}}{c^2} \\ \end{bmatrix} \quad X = \begin{bmatrix} c t \\ \mathbf{r} \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

and in turn, {{math|'''r''', '''r'''&amp;prime;, '''v'''}} are [[column vector]]s (the [[matrix transpose]] of these are row vectors), and {{math|''γ''&lt;sub&gt;'''v'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Lorentz factor]] of velocity {{math|'''v'''}}. The boost matrix is a [[symmetric matrix]]. The inverse transformation is given by

:&lt;math&gt;B(\mathbf {v} )^{-1}=B(-\mathbf {v} )\quad \Rightarrow \quad X=B(-\mathbf {v} )X' &lt;/math&gt;

It is clear that to each admissible velocity {{math|'''v'''}} there corresponds a ''pure'' Lorentz boost,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} \leftrightarrow B(\mathbf{v}).&lt;/math&gt;

Velocity addition {{math|'''u'''&amp;oplus;'''v'''}} corresponds to the composition of boosts {{math|''B''('''v''')''B''('''u''')}} in that order. The {{math|''B''('''u''')}} acts on {{math|''X''}} first, then {{math|''B''('''v''')}} acts on {{math|''B''('''u''')''X''}}. Notice succeeding operators act on the ''left'' in any composition of operators, so {{math|''B''('''v''')''B''('''u''')}} should be interpreted as a boost with velocities {{math|'''u'''}} then {{math|'''v'''}}, not {{math|'''v'''}} then {{math|'''u'''}}. Performing the Lorentz transformations by block matrix multiplication,

:&lt;math&gt;X'' = B(\mathbf{v}) X' \,,\quad X' = B(\mathbf{u}) X \quad \Rightarrow \quad X'' = \Lambda X &lt;/math&gt;

the composite transformation matrix is&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sexl|Urbantke|1992|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \Lambda = B(\mathbf{v}) B(\mathbf{u}) = \begin{bmatrix}\gamma &amp; -\mathbf{a}^\mathrm{T}\\
-\mathbf{b} &amp; \mathbf{M}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

and in turn

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma=\gamma_\mathbf{v}\gamma_\mathbf{u}\left(1+\frac{\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{u}}{c^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} =\frac{\gamma}{c} \mathbf{u}\oplus\mathbf{v} \,, \quad \mathbf{b} = \frac{\gamma}{c} \mathbf{v}\oplus\mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{M}=\gamma_\mathbf{u}\gamma_\mathbf{v}\frac{\mathbf{vu}^\mathrm{T}}{c^2}+\left(\mathbf{I}+\dfrac{\gamma_\mathbf{v}^2}{\gamma_\mathbf{v}+1}\frac{\mathbf{vv}^\mathrm{T}}{c^2}\right)\left(\mathbf{I}+\dfrac{\gamma_\mathbf{u}^2}{\gamma_\mathbf{u}+1}\frac{\mathbf{uu}^\mathrm{T}}{c^2}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

Here {{math|''γ''}} is the composite Lorentz factor, and {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} are 3×1 [[column vector]]s proportional to the composite velocities. The 3×3 matrix {{math|'''M'''}} will turn out to have geometric significance.

The inverse transformations are

:&lt;math&gt; X = B(-\mathbf{u}) X' \,,\quad X' = B(-\mathbf{v}) X'' \quad \Rightarrow \quad X = \Lambda^{-1} X'' &lt;/math&gt;

and the composition amounts to a negation ''and'' exchange of velocities,

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^{-1} = B(-\mathbf{u}) B(-\mathbf{v}) = \begin{bmatrix}\gamma &amp; \mathbf{b}^\mathrm{T}\\
\mathbf{a} &amp; \mathbf{M}^\mathrm{T}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If the relative velocities are exchanged, looking at the blocks of {{math|Λ}}, one observes the composite transformation to be the [[matrix transpose]] of {{math|Λ}}. This is not the same as the original matrix, so the composite Lorentz transformation matrix is not symmetric, and thus not a single boost. This in turn translates to the incompleteness of velocity composition from the result of two boosts, symbolically;

:&lt;math&gt;B(\mathbf u \oplus \mathbf v) \ne B(\mathbf v)B(\mathbf u) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

To make the description complete, it is necessary to introduce a rotation, before or after the boost. This rotation is the '''Thomas rotation'''. A rotation is given by

:&lt;math&gt;X' = R(\boldsymbol{\theta})X&lt;/math&gt;

where the 4×4 rotation matrix is

:&lt;math&gt;R({\boldsymbol {\theta }})={\begin{bmatrix}1&amp;0\\0&amp;\mathbf {R} ({\boldsymbol {\theta }})\end{bmatrix}} &lt;/math&gt;

and {{math|'''R'''}} is a 3×3 [[rotation matrix]].&lt;ref group=nb&gt;In the literature, the 3d rotation matrix {{math|'''R'''}} may be denoted by other letters, others use a name and the relative velocity vectors involved, e.g., {{math|tom['''u''', '''v''']}} for "Thomas rotation" or {{math|gyr['''u''', '''v''']}} for "gyration" (see [[gyrovector space]]). Correspondingly the 4d rotation matrix {{math|''R''}} (non-bold italic) in this article may be denoted

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Tom} = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \mathrm{tom}[\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}] \end{bmatrix} \quad \text{or} \quad \mathrm{Gyr} = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \mathrm{gyr}[\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}] \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In this article the [[axis-angle representation]] is used, and {{math|'''θ''' {{=}} ''θ'''''e'''}} is the "axis-angle vector", the angle {{math|''θ''}} multiplied by a unit vector {{math|'''e'''}} parallel to the axis. Also, the ''right-handed'' convention for the spatial coordinates is used (see [[orientation (vector space)]]), so that rotations are positive in the anticlockwise sense according to the [[right-hand rule]], and negative in the clockwise sense. With these conventions; the rotation matrix rotates any 3d vector about the axis {{math|'''e'''}} through angle {{math|''θ''}} anticlockwise (an [[active transformation]]), which has the equivalent effect of rotating the coordinate frame clockwise about the same axis through the same angle (a passive transformation).

The rotation matrix is an [[orthogonal matrix]], its transpose equals its inverse, and negating either the angle or axis in the rotation matrix corresponds to a rotation in the opposite sense, so the inverse transformation is readily obtained by

:&lt;math&gt;R({\boldsymbol {\theta }})^{-1}=R({\boldsymbol {\theta }})^{\mathrm {T} }= R(-{\boldsymbol {\theta }}) \quad \Rightarrow \quad X=R(-\boldsymbol{\theta})X'\,. &lt;/math&gt;

A boost followed or preceded by a rotation is also Lorentz transformation, since these operations leave the spacetime interval invariant. The same Lorentz transformation has two decompositions for appropriately chosen rapidity and axis-angle vectors;

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda(\boldsymbol{\theta},\mathbf{u})=R(\boldsymbol{\theta})B(\mathbf{u})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda(\mathbf{v},\boldsymbol{\theta})=B(\mathbf{v})R(\boldsymbol{\theta})&lt;/math&gt;

and if these are two decompositions are equal, the two boosts are related by

:&lt;math&gt;B(\mathbf{u})=R(-\boldsymbol{\theta})B(\mathbf{v})R(\boldsymbol{\theta})&lt;/math&gt;

so the boosts are related by a [[matrix similarity]] transformation.

It turns out the equality between two boosts and a rotation followed or preceded by a single boost is correct: the rotation of frames matches the angular separation of the composite velocities, and explains how one composite velocity applies to one frame, while the other applies to the rotated frame. The rotation also breaks the symmetry in the overall Lorentz transformation making it nonsymmetric. For this specific rotation, let the angle be {{math|''ε''}} and the axis be defined by the unit vector {{math|'''e'''}}, so the axis-angle vector is {{math|'''ε''' {{=}} ''ε'''''e'''}}.

Altogether, two different orderings of two boosts means there are two inequivalent transformations. Each of these can be split into a boost then rotation, or a rotation then boost, doubling the number of inequivalent transformations to four. The inverse transformations are equally important; they provide information about what the other observer perceives. In all, there are eight transformations to consider, just for the problem of two Lorentz boosts. In summary, with subsequent operations acting on the left, they are

Matching up the boosts followed by rotations, in the original setup, an observer in {{math|Σ}} notices {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} to move with velocity {{math|'''u'''&amp;oplus;'''v'''}} then rotate clockwise (first diagram), and because of the rotation an observer in Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime; notices {{math|Σ}} to move with velocity {{math|−'''v'''&amp;oplus;'''u'''}} then rotate anticlockwise (second diagram). If the velocities are exchanged an observer in {{math|Σ}} notices {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} to move with velocity {{math|'''v'''&amp;oplus;'''u'''}} then rotate anticlockwise (third diagram), and because of the rotation an observer in {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} notices {{math|Σ}} to move with velocity {{math|−'''u'''&amp;oplus;'''v'''}} then rotate clockwise (fourth diagram).

The cases of rotations then boosts are similar (no diagrams are shown). Matching up the rotations followed by boosts, in the original setup, an observer in {{math|Σ}} notices {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} to rotate clockwise then move with velocity {{math|'''v'''&amp;oplus;'''u'''}}, and because of the rotation an observer in {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} notices {{math|Σ}} to rotate anticlockwise then move with velocity {{math|−'''u'''&amp;oplus;'''v'''}}. If the velocities are exchanged an observer in {{math|Σ}} notices {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} to rotate anticlockwise then move with velocity {{math|'''u'''&amp;oplus;'''v'''}}, and because of the rotation an observer in {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} notices {{math|Σ}} to rotate clockwise then move with velocity {{math|−'''u'''&amp;oplus;'''v'''}}.

===Finding the axis and angle of the Thomas rotation===
The above formulae constitute the relativistic velocity addition and the Thomas rotation explicitly in the general Lorentz transformations. Throughout, in every composition of boosts and decomposition into a boost and rotation, the important formula

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}=\mathbf{R}+\frac1{\gamma+1}\mathbf{ba}^\mathrm{T} &lt;/math&gt;

holds, allowing the rotation matrix to be defined completely in terms of the relative velocities {{math|'''u'''}} and {{math|'''v'''}}. The angle of a rotation matrix in the axis–angle representation can be found from the [[Rotation matrix#Determining the angle|trace of the rotation matrix]], the general result for ''any'' axis is {{math|tr('''R''') {{=}} 1 + 2 cos''ε''}}. Taking the trace of the equation gives&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Macfarlane|1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sexl|Urbantke|1992|pages=4, 11, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gourgoulhon|2013|pages=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\cos\epsilon = \frac{(1+\gamma+\gamma_\mathbf{u}+\gamma_\mathbf{v})^2}{(1+\gamma)(1+\gamma_\mathbf{u})(1+\gamma_\mathbf{v})} - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

The angle {{math|''ε''}} between {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} is ''not'' the same as the angle {{math|''α''}} between {{math|'''u'''}} and {{math|'''v'''}}.

In both frames Σ and Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;, for every composition and decomposition, another important formula

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}=\mathbf{Ra} &lt;/math&gt;

holds. The vectors {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} are indeed related by a rotation, in fact by the same rotation matrix {{math|'''R'''}} which rotates the coordinate frames. Starting from {{math|'''a'''}}, the matrix {{math|'''R'''}} rotates this into {{math|'''b'''}} anticlockwise, it follows their [[cross product]] (in the right-hand convention)

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b}= \frac{\gamma_\mathbf{u}\gamma_\mathbf{v}(\gamma^2 -1)(\gamma+\gamma_\mathbf{v}+\gamma_\mathbf{u}+1)}{c^2(\gamma_\mathbf{v}+1)(\gamma_\mathbf{u}+1)(\gamma+1)} \mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;

defines the axis correctly, therefore the axis is also parallel to {{math|'''u'''×'''v'''}}. The magnitude of this pseudovector is neither interesting nor important, only the direction is, so it can be normalized into the [[unit vector]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e} = \frac{\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v}}{|\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v}|}&lt;/math&gt;

which still completely defines the direction of the axis without loss of information.

The rotation is simply a "static" rotation and there is no relative [[rotational motion]] between the frames, there is relative translational motion in the boost. However, if the frames accelerate, then the rotated frame rotates with an angular velocity. This effect is known as the [[Thomas precession]], and arises purely from the kinematics of successive Lorentz boosts.

== Finding the Thomas rotation ==
{{quote|text=The decomposition process described (below) can be carried through on the product of two pure Lorentz transformations to obtain explicitly the rotation of the coordinate axes resulting from the two successive "boosts". In general, the algebra involved is quite forbidding, more than enough, usually, to discourage any actual demonstration of the rotation matrix|source={{harvtxt|Goldstein|1980|p=286}}}}

In principle, it is pretty easy. Since every Lorentz transformation is a product of a boost and a rotation, the consecutive application of two pure boosts is a pure boost, either followed by or preceded by a pure rotation. Thus suppose

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda = B(\mathbf w)R.&lt;/math&gt;

The task is to glean from this equation the boost velocity {{math|'''w'''}} and the rotation {{math|''R''}} from the matrix entries of {{math|Λ}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|p=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coordinates of events are related by

:&lt;math&gt;x'^\mu = {\Lambda^\mu}_\nu x^\nu.&lt;/math&gt;

Inverting this relation yields

:&lt;math&gt;{(\Lambda^{-1})^\nu}_\mu{\Lambda^\mu}_\rho x^\rho = {(\Lambda^{-1})^\nu}_\mu x'^\mu,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;x^\nu = {\Lambda_\mu}^\nu x'^\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

Set {{math|''x''&amp;prime; {{=}} (''ct''&amp;prime;, 0, 0, 0).}} Then {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''ν''&lt;/sup&gt;}} will record the spacetime position of the origin of the primed system,

:&lt;math&gt;x^\nu = {\Lambda_0}^\nu x'^0,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;x = \begin{pmatrix}ct \\ x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix}{\Lambda_0}^0 ct' \\ {\Lambda_0}^1 ct' \\ {\Lambda_0}^2 ct' \\ {\Lambda_0}^3 ct'\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

But

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^{-1} = (B(\mathbf w)R)^{-1} = R^{-1}B(-\mathbf{w}),&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying this matrix with a pure rotation will not affect the zeroth columns and rows, and

:&lt;math&gt;x = \begin{pmatrix}ct \\ x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix}\gamma ct' \\ \gamma\beta_x ct' \\ \gamma\beta_y ct' \\ \gamma\beta_z ct'\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix}\gamma ct' \\ \gamma w_x t' \\ \gamma w_y t' \\ \gamma w_z t'\end{pmatrix}
= \gamma \begin{pmatrix} ct' \\  w_x t' \\ w_y t' \\ w_z t'\end{pmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;

which could have been anticipated from the formula for a simple boost in the {{math|''x''}}-direction, and for the relative velocity vector

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{ct}\mathbf x = \frac{\mathbf w}{c} = \boldsymbol \beta = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{x_1} {ct} \\ \frac{x_2} {ct} \\ \frac{x_3} {ct}\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix} \beta_x \\ \beta_y \\ \beta_z \end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix}{\Lambda_0}^1/{\Lambda_0}^0 \\ {\Lambda_0}^2/{\Lambda_0}^0 \\ {\Lambda_0}^3/{\Lambda_0}^0 \end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus given with {{math|Λ}}, one obtains {{math|'''β'''}} and {{math|'''w'''}} by little more than inspection of {{math|Λ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. (Of course, {{math|'''w'''}} can also be found using velocity addition per above.) From {{math|'''w'''}}, construct {{math|''B''(−'''w''')}}. The solution for {{math|''R''}} is then

:&lt;math&gt;R = B(-\mathbf w)\Lambda.&lt;/math&gt;

With the ansatz

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda = RB(\mathbf w),&lt;/math&gt;

one finds by the same means

:&lt;math&gt;R = \Lambda B(-\mathbf w).&lt;/math&gt;

Finding a formal solution in terms of velocity parameters {{math|'''u'''}} and {{math|'''v'''}} involves first ''formally'' multiplying {{math|''B''('''v''')''B''('''u''')}}, formally inverting, then reading off {{math|'''β'''&lt;sub&gt;''w''&lt;/sub&gt;}} form the result, ''formally'' building {{math|''B''(−'''w''')}} from the result, and, finally, formally multiplying {{math|''B''(−'''w''')''B''('''v''')''B''('''u''')}}. It should be clear that this is a daunting task, and it is difficult to interpret/identify the result as a rotation, though it is clear a priori that it is. It is these difficulties that the Goldstein quote at the top refers to. The problem has been thoroughly studied under simplifying assumptions over the years.

==Group theoretical origin==
{{main|Lorentz group|Representation theory of the Lorentz group}}

Another way to explain the origin of the rotation is by looking at the generators of the [[Lorentz group]].

=== Boosts from velocities ===
The passage from a velocity to a boost is obtained as follows. An arbitrary boost is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|1999|p=547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B(\boldsymbol \zeta) = e^{-\boldsymbol \zeta \cdot \mathbf K},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''ζ'''}} is a triple of real numbers serving as coordinates on the boost subspace of the Lie algebra {{math|'''so'''(3, 1)}} spanned by the matrices

:&lt;math&gt;(K_1, K_2, K_3) = \left( 
\left[ \begin{smallmatrix}0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0\\1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0 \end{smallmatrix} \right],
\left[ \begin{smallmatrix}0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0 \end{smallmatrix} \right],
\left[ \begin{smallmatrix}0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0 \end{smallmatrix} \right]
\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The vector

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \zeta = \frac{\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\beta} \tanh^{-1}\beta&lt;/math&gt;

is called the ''boost parameter'' or ''boost vector'', its norm is the [[rapidity]]. Here {{mvar|β}} is the ''velocity parameter'', the magnitude of the vector {{math|'''β''' {{=}} '''u'''/''c''}}. While for {{mvar|ζ}} one has {{math|0 ≤ ''ζ'' &lt; ∞}} the {{mvar|β}} is confined by {{math|0 ≤ ''β'' &lt; 1}}, and hence {{math|0 ≤ ''u'' &lt; ''c''}}. Thus

:&lt;math&gt;B(\boldsymbol \zeta) = e^{-(\tanh^{-1}\beta) \frac{ \boldsymbol{\beta}}{\beta} \cdot \mathbf K}
 = e^{-{\tanh^{-1}\beta \over c\beta} \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf K} \equiv B(\mathbf u).&lt;/math&gt;

The set of velocities satisfying {{math|0 ≤ ''u'' &lt; ''c''}} is an open ball in {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} and is called the space of '''admissible velocities''' in the literature. It is endowed with a [[Velocity-addition formula#Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic geometry]] described in the linked article.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|2002|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commutators===
The [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group#Explicit formulas|generators of boosts, {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}]], in different directions do not commute. This has the effect that two consecutive boosts is not a pure boost in general, but a rotation preceding a boost.

Consider a succession of boosts in the x direction, then the y direction, expanding each boost to first order&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ryder|1996|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;e^{\zeta_y K_y}e^{\zeta_x K_x} = (I-\zeta_y K_y+\cdots)(I-\zeta_x K_x+\cdots)= I-\zeta_x K_x -\zeta_y K_y + \zeta_x\zeta_y K_y K_x+\cdots&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;e^{-\zeta_y K_y}e^{-\zeta_x K_x} = I+\zeta_x K_x +\zeta_y K_y + \zeta_x\zeta_y K_y K_x +\cdots &lt;/math&gt;

and the [[group commutator]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
e^{-\zeta_y K_y}e^{-\zeta_x K_x}e^{\zeta_y K_y}e^{\zeta_x K_x} = I &amp; + \zeta_x\zeta_y[K_y,K_x]-(\zeta_xK_x)^2-(\zeta_yK_y)^2 \\
&amp; +\zeta_x^2\zeta_y[K_x,K_y]K_x+\zeta_x\zeta_y^2K_y[K_y,K_x]\\
&amp; +(\zeta_x\zeta_y)^2K_yK_xK_yK_x +\cdots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Three of the [[commutation relation]]s of the Lorentz generators are
:&lt;math&gt; [J_x ,J_y ] =  J_z &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; [K_x ,K_y ] = - J_z &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; [J_x ,K_y ] = K_z &lt;/math&gt;

where the bracket {{math|[''A'', ''B''] {{=}} ''AB'' − ''BA''}} is a [[binary operation]] known as the ''[[commutator]]'', and the other relations can be found by taking [[cyclic permutation]]s of x, y, z components (i.e. change x to y, y to z, and z to x, repeat).

Returning to the group commutator, the commutation relations of the boost generators imply for a boost along the x then y directions, there will be a rotation about the z axis. In terms of the rapidities, the rotation angle {{mvar|θ}} is given by
::&lt;math&gt; \tan \frac{\theta}{2}=\tanh \frac{\zeta_x}{2}\tanh \frac{\zeta_y}{2}  .&lt;/math&gt;

==Spacetime diagrams for non-collinear boosts==
The familiar notion of vector addition for velocities in the [[Euclidean plane]] can be done in a triangular formation, or since vector addition is commutative, the vectors in both orderings geometrically form a parallelogram (see "[[parallelogram law]]"). This does not hold for relativistic velocity addition; instead a [[hyperbolic triangle]] arises whose edges are related to the rapidities of the boosts. Changing the order of the boost velocities, one does not find the resultant boost velocities to coincide.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Varićak|1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary|cabbeling}}
'''Cabbeling''' is when two separate water parcels mix to form a third which sinks below both parents. The combined water parcel is denser than the original two water parcels.

The two parent water parcels may have the same [[density]], but they have different properties; for instance, different [[salinity|salinities]] and [[temperature]]s.&lt;ref name ="EnvironmentalOceanography"&gt;Beer, Tom (1997). Environmental oceanography. Boca Raton: CRC Press. p. 123. {{ISBN|0-8493-8425-7}}, Section 5.4.3 Cabbeling.&lt;/ref&gt; Seawater almost&lt;ref&gt;http://linkingweatherandclimate.com/ocean/waterdensity.php&lt;/ref&gt; always gets more dense if it gets '''either''' slightly colder '''or''' slightly saltier. But medium-warm, medium-salty water can be denser than '''both''' fresher, colder water '''and''' saltier, warmer water; in other words, the equation of state for [[seawater]] is [[monotonic]], but [[non-linear]]. See diagram.

Cabbeling may also occur in fresh water, since [[Properties of water#Density of water and ice|pure water is densest at about 4 °C (39 °F)]]. A mixture of 1&amp;nbsp;°C water and 6&amp;nbsp;°C water, for instance, might have a temperature of 4&amp;nbsp;°C, making it denser than either parent. Ice is also less dense than water, so although ice floats in warm water, meltwater sinks in warm water.

The densification of the new mixed water parcel is a result of a slight contraction upon mixing; a decrease in volume of the combined water parcel.&lt;ref name ="AMSglossary"&gt;[http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=cabbeling&amp;submit=Search AMS glossary],.&lt;/ref&gt;  A new water parcel that has the same [[mass]], but is lower in [[volume]], will be denser.  Denser water sinks or downwells in the otherwise neutral surface of the water body, where the two initial water parcels originated.&lt;ref name="AGUarticle"&gt;[http://europa.agu.org/?uri=/journals/jc/JC092iC05p05448.xml&amp;view=article AGU Thermobaricity, Cabbelling and Water-Mass Conversion]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of term==
The importance of this process in oceanography was first pointed out &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1972|author=Theodore D. Foster|title=An Analysis of the Cabbeling Instability in Sea Water|doi=10.1175/1520-0485(1972)002&lt;0294:AAOTCI&gt;2.0.CO;2|journal=[[w|Journal of Physical Oceanography]]|volume=2|issue=3|page=296|quote="Witte (1902) was evidently the first person to point out the possible importance of this process in the ocean."}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Witte, in a 1902 publication ({{Cite journal|title = Zur Theorie der Stromkabbelungen|last = Witte|first = E.|date = 1902|journal = Gaea, Köln.|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |url=http://publikationen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/frontdoor/deliver/index/docId/20314/file/E000009258.pdf}}).

The German origin of the term has caused some [[etymological]] confusion and disagreements as to the correct spelling of the term;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = An Analysis of Cabbeling Instability in Sea Water|last = Foster|first = T. D.|date = 1972|journal = Journal of Physical Oceanography|volume = 2|issue = 3|pages = 294-301|doi = 10.1175/1520-0485(1972)002&lt;0294:AAOTCI&gt;2.0.CO;2|pmid = |access-date = |quote="Witte thought that the process would be so effective that the sinking would give rise to a rippled or choppy appearance of the sea surface, which in German nautical terminology has been designated "Kabbelung". There is a not very common English cognate "cobbeling" (Webster's ''Second New International Dictionary'') for this word, but the term does not seem to have been generally accepted by oceanographers. There appears to be a great diversity of opinion about the correct spelling of the English word for this mixing process partly, perhaps, due to different opinions concerning the etymology of the word. One opinion is that the word should be spelled "caballing" meaning "to unite in an intrigue" since the two components conspire to form a more dense mixture. Another opinion is that "Kabbelung" should be anglicized to "cabbeling" and can be used to designate the mixing process itself rather than the appearance of a choppy sea surface which was evidently Witte's intention. Rather than introduce a new term we shall follow Stommel (1960, p.31) and refer to the process as "cabbeling"."}}&lt;/ref&gt; for details, see [[wiktionary:cabbeling|the Wiktionary entry on cabelling]]. Oceanographers generally follow Stommel&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Gulf Stream|last = Stommel|first = H.|publisher = University of California Press|year = 1960|isbn = |location = |pages = 31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and refer to the process as "cabbeling"{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}.

== High-latitude cabbeling ==

Cabbeling may occur in high incidence in high latitude waters. [[Polar region]] waters are a place where cold and fresh water melting from [[sea ice]] meets warmer, saltier water.  [[Ocean currents]] are responsible for bringing this warmer, saltier water to higher latitudes, especially on the eastern shores of [[Northern Hemisphere]] continents, and on the western shores of [[Southern Hemisphere]] continents.  The phenomenon of cabbeling has been particularly noted in the [[Weddell Sea]] &lt;ref name ="CabbelingCatastrophies"&gt;[http://www.oc.nps.edu/thermobaricity/workshop/cabbel_draft.pdf Cabbeling in the Weddell Sea paper],.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Greenland Sea]].&lt;ref name ="CabbelingGreenlandBasin"&gt;[http://www.ocean-sci-discuss.net/5/507/2008/osd-5-507-2008.pdf Cabbeling in the Greenland Basin paper],.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''weak gravity conjecture''' ('''WGC''') is a conjecture regarding the strength [[gravity]] can have in a theory of [[quantum gravity]] relative to the gauge forces in that theory. It roughly states that gravity should be the weakest force in any consistent theory of quantum gravity.&lt;ref&gt;"The string landscape, black holes and gravity as the weakest force", Nima Arkani-Hamed, Luboš Motl, Alberto Nicolis and Cumrun Vafa, published 15 June 2007,  ''Journal of High Energy Physics'', Volume 2007, JHEP06 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

In physics, the '''total position-spread (TPS)''' [[tensor]] is a quantity originally introduced in the modern theory of [[electrical conductivity]]. In the case of molecular systems, this tensor measures the fluctuation of the electrons around their mean positions, which corresponds to the delocalization of the electronic charge within a molecular system. The TPS can discriminate between metals and insulators taking information from the ground state [[wave function]]. This quantity can be very useful as an indicator to characterize [[Intervalence charge transfer]] processes, the bond nature of molecules (covalent, ionic or weakly bonded), and [[Metal–insulator transition]].

==Overview==

The Localization Tensor (LT) is a ''per electron'' quantity proposed in the context of the theory of [[Walter Kohn|Kohn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=W. Kohn |title=Theory of the Insulating State |journal=Phys. Rev. |volume=133 |issue= 1A |pages=A171–A181 |year= 1964|pmid= |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.133.A171|bibcode = 1964PhRv..133..171K }}&lt;/ref&gt; to characterize electrical conductivity properties. In 1964, Kohn realized that electrical conductivity is more related to the proper delocalization of the wave function than a simple band gap. In fact, he proposed that a qualitative difference between [[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]] and [[Electrical conductor|conductors]] also manifests as a different organization of the electrons in their ground state where one has that: the wave function is strongly localized in insulators and very delocalized in conductors.

The interesting outcome of this theory is: ''i)'' it relates the classical idea of localized electrons as a cause of insulating state; ''ii)'' the needed information can be recovered from the ground state wave function because in the insulated regime the wave function breaks down as a sum of disconnected terms.

It is until 1999 that Resta and coworkers &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=R. Resta |author2=S. Sorella |title=Electron Localization in the Insulating State |journal=Phys. Rev. Lett. |volume=82 |issue= 2 |pages=370 |year= 1999|pmid= |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.82.370|arxiv = cond-mat/9808151 |bibcode = 1999PhRvL..82..370R }}&lt;/ref&gt; found a way to define the Kohn delocalization by proposing the already mentioned Localization Tensor. The LT is defined as a second order moment cumulant of the position operator divided by the number of electrons in the system. The key property of the LT is that: it diverges for metals while it takes finite values for insulators in the [[Thermodynamic limit]].

Recently, the global quantity (the LT not divided by the number of electrons) has been introduced to study molecules and named Total Position-Spread tensor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=O. Brea |author2=M. El Khatib |author3=C. Angeli |author4=G.L. Bendazzoli |author5=S. Evangelisti |author6=T. Leininger |title=Behavior of the Position–Spread Tensor in Diatomic Systems |journal=J. Chem. Theory Comput.  |volume=9 |issue= 12 |pages=5286–5295 |year= 2013|pmid= 26592266|doi=10.1021/ct400453b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==

=== Spin-summed TPS, (SS-TPS) ===
The total position spread '''Λ''' is defined as the second [[Moment (physics)|moment]] [[cumulant]] of the total electron [[position operator]], and its units are in length square (e.g. bohr²). In order to compute this quantity, one has to take into account the position operator and its tensorial square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M. El Khatib |author2=T. Leininger |author3=G. L. Bendazzoli |author4=S. Evangelisti |title=Computing the Position-Spread Tensor in the CAS-SCF formalism |journal=Chem. Phys. Lett. |volume=591 |issue= 2 |pages=58 |year= 2014|pmid= |doi=10.1016/j.cplett.2013.10.080|bibcode = 2014CPL...591...58E }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a system of ''n'' electrons, the position operator and its Cartesian components are defined as:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{r}} = \sum_{i=1}^n \hat{r}_i&lt;/math&gt; (total position)

: &lt;math&gt;\hat{x} = \sum_{i=1}^n \hat{x}_i \qquad \hat{y} = \sum_{i=1}^n \hat{y}_i     \qquad  \hat{z} = \sum_{i=1}^n \hat{z}_i \qquad&lt;/math&gt;

Where the ''i''  index runs over the number of electrons. Each component of the position operator is a one-electron operator, they can be represented in second quantization as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}= \sum_{ij} \left \langle i\mid \hat{x}\mid j\right \rangle a^{\dagger}_i a_j&lt;/math&gt;

where ''i'',''j'' run over orbitals. The expectation values of the position components are the first moments of the electrons' position.

Now we consider the tensorial square (second moment). In this sense, there are two types of them:

* in [[quantum chemistry]] programs like [[MOLPRO]] or DALTON the second moment operator is a tensor defined as the sum of the tensor squares of the positions of a single electron. Then, this is a one-electron operator ''s'' defined by its Cartesian components:

:: &lt;math&gt;\hat{s}_{xx}=\sum_{i=1}^n \hat{x}_i^2 \qquad \hat{s}_{xy}=\sum_{i=1}^n \hat{x} \hat{y}\qquad \hat{s}_{xz}=\sum_{i=1}^n \hat{x} \hat{z} &lt;/math&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt;\hat{s}_{yy}=\sum_{i=1}^n \hat{y}_i^2 \qquad \hat{s}_{yz}=\sum_{i=1}^n \hat{y} \hat{z}\qquad \hat{s}_{zz}=\sum_{i=1}^n \hat{z}_i^2 &lt;/math&gt;

: where index ''i'' runs over the number of electrons. 
* there is also the square of the total position operator &lt;math&gt;\hat{r}&lt;/math&gt;. This is a two-electron operator ''S'', and also defined by its Cartesian components:

:: &lt;math&gt;\hat{S}_{xx}=\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \hat{x}_i \hat{x}_j \qquad \hat{S}_{xy}=\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \hat{x}_i \hat{y}_j \qquad \hat{S}_{xz}=\sum_{i=1}^n  \sum_{j=1}^n\hat{x}_i \hat{z}_j &lt;/math&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt;\hat{S}_{yy}=\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \hat{y}_i\hat{y}_j \qquad \hat{S}_{yz}=\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \hat{y}_i \hat{z}_j\qquad \hat{S}_{zz}=\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n \hat{z}_i \hat{z}_j &lt;/math&gt;

: where indices ''i'',''j'' run over electrons.

The second moment of the position becomes then the sum of the one- and two-electron operators already defined:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{S}_{ab} = \mathbf{\hat{S}}_{ab} + \mathbf{\hat{s}}_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;

Given a ''n''-electron wave function &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt;, one wants to compute the ''second moment cumulant'' of it.  A cumulant is a linear combination of moments so we have:

: &lt;math&gt;\Lambda = \left \langle \Psi\mid S_{ab}\mid\Psi\right \rangle_c = \left \langle \Psi\mid S_{ab}\mid\Psi\right \rangle - \left \langle \Psi\mid\hat{a}\mid\Psi\right \rangle \left \langle \Psi\mid\hat{b}\mid\Psi\right \rangle&lt;/math&gt;

=== Spin-partitioned TPS, (SP-TPS) ===

The position operator can be partitioned according to spin components.

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat r} = \sum_{\sigma = \alpha,\beta} \mathbf{\hat r_{\sigma}}&lt;/math&gt;

From the one-particle operator it is possible to define the total spin-partitioned position operator as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat R} = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{\sigma=\alpha,\beta} \mathbf{\hat R}(i)
    \mathbf{\hat n}_\sigma(i)&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the total position operator &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat R}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed by the sum of the two spin parts &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;:
                                                                                                                     
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat R} = \mathbf{\hat R_{\alpha}} + \mathbf{\hat R_{\beta}}&lt;/math&gt;

and the square of the total position operator decomposes as:                    
                                                                                
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat R}^2 = \mathbf{\hat R}_{\alpha}^2 + \mathbf{\hat R}_{\beta}^2 + \mathbf{\hat R}_{\alpha} \mathbf{\hat R}_{\beta} + \mathbf{\hat R}_{\beta} \mathbf{\hat R}_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;                                                      
                                                                                
Thus, there are four joint second moment cumulant of the spin-partitioned position operator:                                                                       
                                                                                
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Lambda} = \mathbf{\Lambda}_{\alpha\alpha} + \mathbf{\Lambda}_{\beta\beta}   
    +  \mathbf{ \Lambda}_{\alpha\beta} +  \mathbf{\Lambda}_{\beta\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==

===Model Hamiltonians===

====Hubbard model====
[[File:HubbardTPS.png|thumbnail|Figure 1: SS-TPS as a function of the ''-t/U'' ratio is computed numerically for equally-spaced 1D chains of hydrogen atoms.]]
The [[Hubbard model]] is a very simple and approximate model employed in [[Condensed matter physics]] to describe the transition of materials from metals to insulators. It takes into account only two parameters: ''i)'' the kinetic energy or hopping integral denoted by ''-t''; and  ''ii)'' the on-site repulsion between electrons represented by ''U'' (see the [[Hubbard model#Example: 1D chain of hydrogen atoms|example for 1D chain of hydrogen atoms]]).

In Figure 1, there are two limit cases to consider: larger values of ''-t/U'' representing a strong charge fluctuation (electrons free to move) whereas for small values of ''-t/U'' the electrons are completely localized. The SS-TPS is very sensitive to these changes, because it increases faster than linearly when electrons start to present mobility (0.0 to 0.5 range of ''-t/U'').

====Heisenberg model====
&lt;!-- [[File:HeisTPS.png|thumbnail|Figure 2: ]] --&gt;

=== Monitor the wave function ===
[[File:H2TPS.png|thumbnail|Figure 3: SS-TPS as a function of the internuclear distance R for the hydrogen dimer.]]
The TPS is a powerful tool to monitor the wave function. In Figure 3 is shown the longitudinal SS-TPS ('''Λ&lt;sup&gt;∥&lt;/sup&gt;''') computed at [[full configuration interaction]] level for the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; diatomic molecule. The '''Λ&lt;sup&gt;∥&lt;/sup&gt;''' in the high repulsive region shows a value that is lower than in the asymptotic limit. This is a consequence of nuclei being near to each other's causing and enhancement of the effective nuclear charge that makes electrons to be more localized. When stretching the bond, the TPS starts growing until it reaches a maximum (strong delocalization of the wave function) before the bond is broken. Once the bond is broken, the wave function becomes a sum of disconnected localized regions and the tensor decreases until it reaches twice the value of the atomic limit (1 bohr² for each hydrogen atom).

=== Spin delocalization ===
[[File:H2SPTPS.png|thumbnail|Figure 4: SP-TPS as a function of the internuclear distance R for the hydrogen dimer.]]
When the total position-spread tensor is partitioned according to spin (SP-TPS), it becomes a powerful tool to describe spin delocalization in the insulating regime.  In Figure 4 is shown the longitudinal SP-TPS ('''Λ&lt;sup&gt;∥&lt;/sup&gt;''') computed at [[full configuration interaction]] level for the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; diatomic molecule. The horizontal line at 0 bohr&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; divides the same spin (positive values) and different spin (negative values) contributions of the spin partitioned TPS. Unlike the SS-TPS that saturates to the atomic value for R&gt;5, the SP-TPS diverges as R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; indicating that there is a strong spin delocalization. The SP-TPS can also be seen as a measure of how strong the electron correlation is.

== Properties ==

The TPS is a cumulant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=R. Kubo |title=Generalized cumulant expansion method |journal=Journal of the Physical Society of Japan |volume=17 |issue= 7 |pages=1100–1120 |year= 1962|pmid= |doi=10.1143/JPSJ.17.1100|bibcode = 1962JPSJ...17.1100K }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus it possesses the following properties:

# Cumulants can be explicitly represented only by moments of lower or equal order.
# Cumulants are a linear combination of the products of these moments of lower or equal order.
# Cumulants are additive. This is a very important property when studying molecular systems because it means that the TPS tensor shows size consistency.
# A diagonal element of the cumulant tensor is the [[variance]] (see also [[Measurement in quantum mechanics#Statistics of measurement|this article]]), and it is always a positive value.
# Cumulants also are invariant under translation of the origin of when they are of order ≥&amp;nbsp;2. The TPS tensor being a second-order culumant, is invariant under translation of the origin.
# The TPS is more sensitive to the variation of the [[wave function]] than the energy, which makes it a good indicator for instance in a [[Metal–insulator transition]] situation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6406">A model of a charged [[membrane]] introduced by [[Paul Dirac]] in 1962. Dirac's original motivation was to explain the mass of the [[muon]] as an excitation of the ground state corresponding to an [[electron]]. Anticipating the birth of [[string theory]] by almost a decade, he was the first to introduce what is now called a type of [[Nambu–Goto action]] for membranes.

In the '''Dirac membrane model''' the repulsive electromagnetic forces on the membrane are balanced by the contracting ones coming from the positive tension. In the case of the spherical membrane, classical equations of motion imply that the balance is met for the radius &lt;math&gt;0.75 r_e&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; r_e &lt;/math&gt; is the [[classical electron radius]]. Using Bohr–Sommerfeld quantisation condition for the Hamiltonian of the spherically symmetric membrane, Dirac finds the approximation of the mass corresponding to the first excitation as &lt;math&gt;53 m_e&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;m_e&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the electron, which is about a quarter of the observed muon mass.

== Action principle ==

Dirac chose a non-standard way to formulate the action principle for the membrane. Because closed membranes in  &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3  &lt;/math&gt; provide a natural split of space into the interior and the exterior there exists a special curvilinear system of coordinates  &lt;math&gt;x^{\mu} &lt;/math&gt; in spacetime and a function  &lt;math&gt;f(x) &lt;/math&gt; such that 
 
-  &lt;math&gt;f(x)=0 &lt;/math&gt; defines a membrane

-  &lt;math&gt;f(x)&gt;0 &lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;0 &lt;/math&gt; describe a region outside or inside the membrane
 
Choosing  &lt;math&gt;x^1=f(x) &lt;/math&gt; and   the following gauge &lt;math&gt;\sigma^0=x^0=:\tau &lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\sigma^1=x^2 &lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2=x^3 &lt;/math&gt;  
where  &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{\alpha} &lt;/math&gt;, ( &lt;math&gt;\alpha=0,1,2 &lt;/math&gt;) is the internal parametrization of the membrane word-volume, the membrane action proposed by Dirac is

:&lt;math&gt; S=S_{EM} +S_{membrane} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; S_{EM}=-\frac{1}{16\pi}\int_{x^1&gt;0} J g^{\mu\rho}g^{\nu\sigma}F_{\mu\nu}F_{\rho\sigma}d^4x, \ \ \ \ S_{mem.}= - \frac{\omega}{4\pi}\int_{x^1=0} M dx^0dx^2dx^3 &lt;/math&gt;
where the induced metric and the factors J and M are given by
:&lt;math&gt; g_{\mu\nu}=\partial_{\mu}y^{\Lambda}\partial_{\nu}y_{\Lambda},\ \ \ \Lambda=0,1,2,3 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;J=\sqrt{-\det g_{\mu\nu}}.\ \ \ M=J\sqrt{-g^{11}} &lt;/math&gt;

In the above &lt;math&gt;y^{\Lambda}&lt;/math&gt; are rectilinear and orthogonal. The space-time signature used is  (+,-,-,-). Note that &lt;math&gt;S_{EM}&lt;/math&gt; is just a usual action for the electromagnetic field in a curvilinear system while &lt;math&gt;S_{membrane}&lt;/math&gt;is the integral over the membrane world-volume i.e. precisely the type of the action used later in string theory.

== Equations of motion ==

There are 3 equations of motion following from the variation with respect to &lt;math&gt;A_{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y^\Lambda &lt;/math&gt;. They are:
- variation w.r.t. &lt;math&gt;A_{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x_1&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; - this results in sourceless Maxwell equations 
- variation w.r.t. &lt;math&gt;y^{\Lambda}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x_1&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; - this gives a consequence of Maxwell equations
- variation w.r.t. &lt;math&gt;y^{\Lambda}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x_1=0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2}F_{\alpha 1}F^{\alpha 1} = \omega J^{-1}(M g^{1\mu}/g^{11})_{,\mu} &lt;/math&gt;

The last equation has a geometric interpretation: the r.h.s. is proportional to the curvature of the membrane. For the spherically symmetric case we get

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{e^2}{2\rho^4} =\omega\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\dot{\rho}}{\sqrt{1-\dot{\rho}^2}}+ \frac{2\omega}{\rho\sqrt{1-\dot{\rho}^2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the balance condition &lt;math&gt;\dot{\rho}=0&lt;/math&gt; implies  &lt;math&gt;a^3=e^2/4\omega&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the balanced membrane. The  total energy  for the spherical membrane with radius &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt; E(\rho)=e^2/2\rho + \beta \rho^2 &lt;/math&gt;  
and it is minimal in the equilibrium for &lt;math&gt;\beta=\omega&lt;/math&gt;,  hence &lt;math&gt;E(a)=3e^2/4a  &lt;/math&gt;. On the other hand, the total energy in the equilibrium should be &lt;math&gt;m_e&lt;/math&gt; (in &lt;math&gt;c=1&lt;/math&gt; units)
and so we obtain &lt;math&gt;a=0.75r_e&lt;/math&gt;.

== Hamiltonian formulation ==

Small oscillations about the equilibrium in the spherically symmetric case imply frequencies - &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{6}/a&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, going to quantum theory,  the energy of one quantum would be &lt;math&gt;h\nu = \sqrt{6}\hbar/a = 448m_e&lt;/math&gt;.
This is much more than the muon mass but the frequencies are by no means small so this approximation may not work properly. To get a better quantum theory one needs to work out the Hamiltonian of the system and solve the corresponding Schroedinger equation.

For the Hamiltonian formulation Dirac introduces generalised momenta

-  for &lt;math&gt;x^1&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;B^{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;w_R&lt;/math&gt; - momenta conjugate to &lt;math&gt;A_{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y^R&lt;/math&gt; respectively (&lt;math&gt;R=1,2,3&lt;/math&gt;, coordinate choice &lt;math&gt;x^0=y^0&lt;/math&gt;)

- for &lt;math&gt;x^1=0&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;W_R&lt;/math&gt; - momenta conjugate to &lt;math&gt;y^R&lt;/math&gt;

Then one notices the following constraints

- for the Maxwell field 
:&lt;math&gt; B^0=0, \ \ \ {B^r}_{,r}=0, \ \ \ w_R {y^R}_{,s} - B^r F_{rs}=0 &lt;/math&gt;

- for membrane momenta
:&lt;math&gt; W_R {y^R}_{,2} = W_R {y^R}_{,3} =0, \ \ \  16\pi^2 W_RW_R = \omega^2 M^2c^{00}(c^{00}-1) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c^{ab}&lt;/math&gt; - reciprocal of &lt;math&gt;g_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a,b=0,2,3&lt;/math&gt;.

These constraints need to be included when calculating the Hamiltonian, using the [[Dirac bracket]] method.  
The result of this calculation is  the Hamiltonian of the form
:&lt;math&gt; H=H_{EM}+H_s &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; H_s= \frac{1}{4\pi} \int \sqrt{16\pi^2 W_RW_R +\omega^2(g_{22}g_{33}-g_{23}^2)}dx^2dx^3 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;H_{EM}&lt;/math&gt; is the Hamiltonian for the electromagnetic field written in the curvilinear system.

== Quantisation ==

For spherically symmetric motion the Hamiltonian is 
:&lt;math&gt; H = \sqrt{\eta^2+ \omega^2\rho^4} + e^2/2\rho, \ \ \ \{ \rho, \eta\}=1  &lt;/math&gt;

however the direct quantisation is not clear due to the square-root of the differential operator. To get any further Dirac considers the Bohr - Sommerfeld method:
:&lt;math&gt; 2\pi \hbar n = 2 \int_{\rho_{min}}^{\rho_{max}} \eta d\rho  &lt;/math&gt;
and finds &lt;math&gt;E_1 \approx 53m_e&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt;.

{{refimprove|date=April 2016}}
{{expert subject|1=Physics|date=April 2016}}
The '''Hopkinson effect''' is a feature of [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] or [[Ferrimagnetism|ferrimagnetic]] materials, in which an increase in [[magnetic susceptibility]] is observed at temperatures between the [[Superparamagnetism#Blocking_temperature|blocking temperature]] and the [[Curie temperature]] of the material.  The Hopkinson effect can be observed as a peak in thermomagnetic curves that immediately precedes the susceptibility drop associated with the Curie temperature. It was first observed by [[John Hopkinson]] in 1889 in a study on iron.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkinson, John. “Magnetic and Other Physical Properties of Iron at a High Temperature”. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. A 180 (1889): 443–465.&lt;/ref&gt;

In single domain particles, a large Hopkinson peak results from a transient [[Superparamagnetism|superparamagnetic]] particle domain state.

'''Rogue waves''' (also known as '''freak waves''', '''monster waves''', '''episodic waves''', '''killer waves''', '''extreme waves''', and '''abnormal waves''') are large, unexpected and suddenly appearing [[surface wave]]s that can be extremely dangerous, even to large [[ship]]s such as [[ocean liner]]s.&lt;ref name="Econ1"&gt;{{cite news

Rogue waves present considerable danger for several reasons: they are rare, unpredictable, may appear suddenly or without warning, and can impact with tremendous force. A {{convert|12|m|adj=on}} wave in the usual "linear" wave model would have a breaking pressure of {{convert|6|MT/m2|psi|abbr=~}}. Although modern ships are designed to tolerate a breaking wave of {{convert|15|MT/m2|psi|abbr=on}}, a rogue wave can dwarf both of these figures with a breaking pressure of {{convert|100|MT/m2|psi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="skuld" /&gt;

In [[oceanography]], rogue waves are more precisely defined as waves whose [[wave height|height]] is more than twice the [[significant wave height]] (''H''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; or SWH), which is itself defined as the mean of the largest third of waves in a wave record. Therefore, rogue waves are not necessarily the biggest waves found on the water; they are, rather, unusually large waves for a given [[sea state]]. Rogue waves seem not to have a single distinct cause, but occur where physical factors such as high winds and strong currents cause waves to merge to create a single exceptionally large wave.&lt;ref name="Econ1"/&gt;

Rogue waves can occur in media other than water. They appear to be ubiquitous in nature and have also been reported in liquid [[helium]], in nonlinear optics and in microwave cavities. Recent research has focused on [[optical rogue waves]] which facilitate the study of the phenomenon in the [[laboratory]]. A 2015 paper studied the wave behavior around a rogue wave, including optical, and the [[Draupner wave]], and concluded that "rogue events do not necessarily appear without a warning, but are often preceded by a short phase of relative order".&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.213901 Predictability of Rogue Events], Simon Birkholz, Carsten Brée, Ayhan Demircan, and Günter Steinmeyer, ''Physical Review Letters'' 114, 213901, 28 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The physical origin of a rogue wave can be defined by the [[Rogue_wave_theorem#Rogue_Wave_Theorem|rogue wave theorem]].

== Background ==

Rogue waves are an open water phenomenon, in which [[wind]]s, [[water current|currents]], [[non-linear system|non-linear]] phenomena such as [[soliton]]s, and other circumstances cause a wave to briefly form that is far larger than the "average" large occurring wave (the [[significant wave height]] or 'SWH') of that time and place. The basic underlying physics that makes phenomena such as rogue waves possible is that different waves can travel at different speeds, and so they can "pile up" in certain circumstances – known as "[[constructive interference]]". (In deep ocean the speed of a [[gravity wave]] is proportional to the square root of its wavelength—the distance peak-to-peak.) However other situations can also give rise to rogue waves, particularly situations where [[non-linearity|non-linear effects]] or instability effects can cause energy to move between waves and be concentrated in one or very few extremely large waves before returning to "normal" conditions.

Once considered mythical and lacking hard evidence for their existence, rogue waves are now proven to exist and known to be a natural ocean phenomenon. Eyewitness accounts from mariners and damage inflicted on ships have long suggested they occurred. The first scientific evidence of the existence of rogue waves came with the recording of a rogue wave by the Gorm platform in the central [[North Sea]] in 1984. A stand-out wave was detected with a wave height of {{convert|11|m}} in a relatively low sea state.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Soest.hawaii.edu_April_16_2016c"/&gt; However, the wave that caught the attention of the scientific community was the digital measurement of the "[[Draupner wave]]", a rogue wave at the [[Draupner platform]] in the North Sea on January 1, 1995, with a maximum wave height of {{convert|25.6|m}} (peak elevation of {{convert|18.5|m|disp=sqbr}}) . During that event, minor damage was also inflicted on the platform, far above sea level, confirming that the reading was valid.&lt;ref name="haver2003freak"/&gt;

Their existence has also since been confirmed by video and photographs, and [[satellite imagery]] and radar of the ocean surface,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

A rogue wave is a natural ocean phenomenon that is not caused by land movement, only lasts briefly, occurs in a limited location, and most often happens far out at sea.&lt;ref name="Econ1"/&gt; Rogue waves are considered rare but potentially very dangerous, since they can involve the spontaneous formation of massive waves far beyond the usual expectations of [[ship design]]ers, and can overwhelm the usual capabilities of ocean-going vessels which are not designed for such encounters. Rogue waves are therefore distinct from [[tsunami]]s.&lt;ref name="Econ1"/&gt; Tsunamis are caused by massive displacement of water, often resulting from [[earthquake|sudden movement]] of the [[ocean floor]], after which they propagate at high speed over a wide area. They are nearly unnoticeable in deep water and only become dangerous as they approach the shoreline and the ocean floor becomes shallower;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

They are also distinct from [[megatsunami]]s, which are single massive waves caused by sudden impact, such as [[meteor impact]] or [[landslide]]s within enclosed or limited bodies of water. They are also different from the waves described as "[[hundred-year wave]]s", which is a purely [[statistics|statistical]] prediction of the highest wave likely to occur in a hundred-year period in a particular body of water.

Rogue waves have now been proven to be the cause of the sudden loss of some ocean-going vessels.

== History of rogue wave knowledge ==
[[Image:Wea00800,1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Merchant ship labouring in heavy seas as a huge wave looms ahead, ca. 1940. Huge waves are common near the 100-[[feet]] line in the [[Bay of Biscay]].]]

===Mythical waves===

In 1826, French scientist and naval officer Captain [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]] reported waves as high as {{convert|33|m|ft|1|order=flip|abbr=on}} in the Indian Ocean with three colleagues as witnesses, yet he was publicly ridiculed by fellow scientist [[François Arago]]. In that era it was widely held that no wave could exceed {{convert|9|m|ft|1|order=flip|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Parker2012"&gt;{{cite book

In an era when opinions were being expressed that no wave would exceed 30 feet, Dumont d'Urville's estimations were received, it seemed, with some scepticism. No one was more outspoken in his rejection than François Arago, who, calling for a more scientific approach to the estimation of wave height in his instructions for the physical research on the voyage of the Bonité, suggested that imagination played a part in estimations as high as '33 metres' (108 feet). Later, in his 1841 report on the results of the Vénus expedition, Arago made further reference to the 'truly prodigious waves with which the lively imagination of certain navigators delights in covering the seas'

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Author Susan Casey wrote that much of that disbelief came because there were very few people who had seen a rogue wave, and until the advent of steel double-hulled ships of the 20th century "people who encountered 100-foot rogue waves generally weren't coming back to tell people about it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2010/09/26/the_wave_susan_casey_interview/|title="The Wave": The growing danger of monster waves|author=|date=26 September 2010|website=salon.com|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For almost 100 years, oceanographers, meteorologists, engineers and ship designers have used a mathematical system commonly called the [[Gaussian function]] (or Gaussian Sea or standard linear model) to predict wave height.&lt;ref name="SoaresSantos2014"&gt;{{cite book

In a storm sea with a significant wave height of {{convert|12|m|ft|1}}, the model suggests there will hardly ever be a wave higher than {{convert|15|m|ft|1}}. One of {{convert|30|m|ft|1}} could indeed happen – but only once in ten thousand years (of wave height of {{convert|12|m|ft|1|disp=sqbr}}). This basic assumption was well accepted (and acknowledged to be an approximation). The use of a Gaussian form to model waves has been the sole basis of virtually every text on that topic for the past 100 years.&lt;ref name="SoaresSantos2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MyUser_Chl.erdc.usace.army.mil_April_16_2016c"&gt;{{cite web

The first known scientific article on "Freak waves" was written by Professor Laurence Draper in 1964. In that paper which has been described as a 'seminal article' he documented the efforts of the National Institute of Oceanography in the early 1960s to record wave height and the highest wave recorded at that time which was about {{convert|67|ft|m|1|order=flip|abbr=on}}. Draper also described ''freak wave holes''.&lt;ref name="Draper1"&gt;{{cite journal

In 1995, strong scientific evidence for the existence of rogue waves came with the recording of what has become known as the [[Draupner wave]]. The [[Draupner platform|Draupner E]] is one structure in a gas pipeline support complex operated by [[Statoil]] about {{convert|100|miles|km|order=flip}}&lt;sup&gt;{{Coord|58|11|19.30|N|2|28|0.00|E|display=inline}}&lt;/sup&gt; offshore and west by southwest from the southern tip of Norway.&lt;ref name="TheWeek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="factpages"&gt;{{cite web|title=Factpages, Norwegian Petroleum Directorate|url=http://factpages.npd.no/FactPages/default.aspx?nav1=licence&amp;nav2=PageView%7cAll&amp;nav3=20884|publisher=Norwegian Petroleum Directorate|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sciencenordic.com"/&gt; The Draupner E platform is the first major oil platform of the jacket-type attached to the seabed with a bucket foundation instead of pilings and a suction anchoring system.&lt;ref name="Sciencenordic.com"/&gt; As a precaution, the operator (Statoil) fitted the platform with an extensive array of instrumentation. The instruments continuously check the platform's movements in particular any movement of the foundations during storm events. The state-of-the-art instrumentation fitted to the platform was able to continuously measure seven key parameters:&lt;ref name="Sciencenordic.com"/&gt;
* wave height, 
* wave slope, 
* wave hold, 
* pressure of the bucket foundations, 
* tension in the platform pillars, and 
* acceleration on deck and foundations.

The rig was built to withstand a calculated 1 in 10,000 years wave with a predicted height of {{convert|64|ft|m|1|order=flip|abbr=on}} and was also fitted with state-of-the-art laser wave recorder on the platform’s underside. At 3 p.m. on 1 January 1995 it recorded an {{convert|85|ft|m|1}} rogue wave (i.e. {{convert|21|ft|m|1|disp=sqbr|order=flip|abbr=on}} taller than the predicted 10,000 year wave) that hit the rig at {{convert|45|mph|km/h|1|order=flip|abbr=on}}. This was the first confirmed measurement of a freak wave, more than twice as tall and steep as its neighbors with characteristics that fell outside any known wave model. The wave was recorded by all of the sensors fitted to the platform&lt;ref name="Sciencenordic.com"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Bjarne Røsjø, Kjell Hauge|title=Proof: Monster Waves are real|url=http://sciencenordic.com/proof-monster-waves-are-real|publisher=ScienceNordic|date=2011-11-08|quote=»Draupner E had only been operating in the North Sea for around half a year, when a huge wave struck the platform like a hammer. When we first saw the data, we were convinced it had to be a technological error « says Per Sparrevik. He is the head of the underwater technology, instrumentation and monitoring at the Norwegian NGI.  But the data was not wrong. When NGI looked over the measurements and calculated the effect of the wave that had hit the platform, the conclusion was clear: The wave that struck the unmanned platform Draupner E on 1 January 1995 was indeed extreme.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it caused enormous interest in the scientific community.&lt;ref name="TheWeek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sciencenordic.com"/&gt;

===Modern knowledge===

Statoil researchers presented a paper in 2000 which collated evidence that freak waves were not the rare realizations of a typical or slightly non-gaussian sea surface population (''Classical'' extreme waves) but rather they were the typical realizations of a rare and strongly non-gaussian sea surface population of waves (''Freak'' extreme waves).&lt;ref name="2000_ISOPE_Conference"&gt;{{cite conference

In 2000 the British oceanographic vessel [[RRS Discovery (1962)|RRS ''Discovery'']] recorded a {{convert|29|m|adj=on}} wave off the coast of Scotland near [[Rockall]]. This was a scientific research vessel and was fitted with high quality instruments. The subsequent analysis determined that under severe gale force conditions with wind speeds averaging {{convert|21|m/s|ft/s|1}} a ship-borne wave recorder measured individual waves up to {{convert|29.1|m|ft|1}} from crest to trough, and a maximum significant wave height of {{convert|18.5|m|ft|1}}. These were some of the largest waves recorded by scientific instruments up to that time. The authors noted that modern wave prediction models are "known" to significantly under-predict extreme sea states for waves with a 'significant' height (H&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) above {{convert|12|m|ft|1}}. The analysis of this event took a number of years, and noted that "none of the state-of-the-art weather forecasts and wave models—the information upon which all ships, oil rigs, fisheries, and passenger boats rely—had predicted these behemoths." Put simply, a scientific model (and also ship design method) to describe the waves encountered did not exist. This finding was widely reported in the press which reported that "according to all of the theoretical models at the time under this particular set of weather conditions waves of this size should not have existed".&lt;ref name="Econ1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rockall"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TheWeek"&gt;{{cite web

Under severe gale force conditions with wind speeds averaging 21 ms1 a shipborne wave recorder measured individual waves up to 29.1 m from crest to trough, and a maximum significant wave height of 18.5 m. The fully formed sea developed in unusual conditions as westerly winds blew across the North Atlantic for two days, during which time a frontal system propagated at a speed close to the group velocity of the peak waves. The measurements are compared to a wave hindcast which successfully simulated the arrival of the wave group but underestimated the most extreme waves.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 | quote      = The area of the Central North Sea is notorious for the occurrence of very high waves in certain wave trains. The short-term distribution of these wave trains includes waves which are far steeper than predicted by the Rayleigh distribution. Such waves are often termed “extreme waves” or “freak waves.” An analysis of the extreme statistical properties of these waves has been made. The analysis is based on more than 12 yr of wave records from the Mærsk Olie og Gas AS operated Gorm Field which is located in the Danish sector of the Central North Sea. From the wave recordings more than 400 freak wave candidates were found. The ratio between the extreme crest height and the significant wave height (20-min value) has been found to be about 1.8, and the ratio between extreme crest height and extreme wave height has been found to be 0.69. The latter ratio is clearly outside the range of Gaussian waves, and it is higher than the maximum value for steep nonlinear long-crested waves, thus indicating that freak waves are not of a permanent form, and probably of short-crested nature. The extreme statistical distribution is represented by a Weibull distribution with an upper bound, where the upper bound is the value for a depth-limited breaking wave. Based on the measured data, a procedure for determining the freak wave crest height with a given return period is proposed. A sensitivity analysis of the extreme value of the crest height is also made. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research confirms that observed wave height distribution in general follows well the [[Rayleigh distribution]], but in shallow waters during high energy events, extremely high waves are more rare than this particular model predicts.&lt;ref name="Laird1" /&gt;

Rogue waves may also occur in [[lake]]s. A phenomenon known as the "Three Sisters" is said to occur in [[Lake Superior]] when a series of three large waves forms. The second wave hits the ship's deck before the first wave clears. The third incoming wave adds to the two accumulated backwashes and suddenly overloads the ship deck with tons of water. The phenomenon is one of various theories as to the cause of the sinking of the [[SS Edmund Fitzgerald]] on Lake Superior in November 1975.&lt;ref name="Wolff"&gt;Wolff, Julius F. (1979).

Serious studies of the phenomenon of rogue waves only started about 20–30 years ago and have intensified since about 2005. One of the remarkable features of the rogue waves is that they always appear from nowhere and quickly disappear without a trace. Recent research has suggested that there could also be 'super-rogue waves' which are up to five times the average sea-state. Rogue waves has now become a near universal term given by scientists to describe isolated large amplitude waves, that occur more frequently than expected for normal, Gaussian distributed, statistical events. Rogue waves appear to be ubiquitous in nature and are not limited to the oceans. They appear in other contexts and have recently been reported in liquid helium, in nonlinear optics and in microwave cavities. It is now universally accepted by marine researchers that these waves belong to a specific kind of sea wave, not taken into account by conventional models for sea wind waves.&lt;ref name="2008AnnualReview"&gt;{{cite journal

Researchers at the [[Australian National University]] have also recently (2012) proven the existence of ''rogue wave holes'', an inverted profile of a rogue wave. In maritime folk-lore, stories of rogue holes are as common as stories of rogue waves. They follow from theoretical analysis but had never been proven experimentally. In 2012 the ANU published research confirming the existence of rogue wave holes on the water surface observed in a water wave tank.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Onlinelibrary.wiley.com_April_16_2016c"&gt;{{cite journal

There are a number of research programmes currently underway focussed on rogue waves including:

* In the course of Project MaxWave, researchers from the GKSS Research Centre, using data collected by [[ESA]] [[satellite]]s, identified a large number of radar signatures that have been portrayed as evidence for rogue waves.

Because the phenomenon of rogue waves is still a matter of active research, it is premature to state clearly what the most common causes are or whether they vary from place to place. The areas of highest predictable risk appear to be where a strong [[ocean current|current]] runs counter to the primary direction of travel of the waves; the area near [[Cape Agulhas]] off the southern tip of Africa is one such area; the warm [[Agulhas Current]] runs to the southwest, while the dominant winds are [[westerlies]]. However, since this thesis does not explain the existence of all waves that have been detected, several different mechanisms are likely, with localized variation. Suggested mechanisms for freak waves include the following:

;[[Diffraction|Diffractive]] [[Focus (geometry)|focus]]ing :According to this hypothesis, coast shape or seabed shape directs several small waves to meet in phase. Their crest heights combine to create a freak wave.&lt;ref name="OPC"&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate = May 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Focusing by currents :Waves from one current are driven into an opposing current. This results in shortening of wavelength, causing shoaling (i.e., increase in wave height), and oncoming wave trains to compress together into a rogue wave.&lt;ref name="OPC"/&gt; This happens off the South African coast, where the [[Agulhas Current]] is countered by [[westerlies]].&lt;ref name="Iopscience.iop.org_April_17_2016c"/&gt;

;[[Nonlinear]] effects ([[modulational instability]]) :It seems possible to have a rogue wave occur by natural, nonlinear processes from a random background of smaller waves.&lt;ref name="BBCFreak"/&gt; In such a case, it is hypothesized, an unusual, unstable wave type may form which 'sucks' energy from other waves, growing to a near-vertical monster itself, before becoming too unstable and collapsing shortly after. One simple model for this is a wave equation known as the [[nonlinear Schrödinger equation]] (NLS), in which a normal and perfectly accountable (by the standard linear model) wave begins to 'soak' energy from the waves immediately fore and aft, reducing them to minor ripples compared to other waves. The NLS can be used in deep water conditions. In shallow water, waves are described by the [[Korteweg–de Vries equation]] or the [[Boussinesq approximation (water waves)|Boussinesq equation]]. These equations also have non-linear contributions and show solitary-wave solutions. A small-scale rogue wave consistent with the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (the Peregrine Solution) was produced in a laboratory water tank in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

;[[Wind wave]] interactions :While it is unlikely that wind alone can generate a rogue wave, its effect combined with other mechanisms may provide a fuller explanation of freak wave phenomena. As wind blows over the ocean, energy is transferred to the sea surface. When strong winds from a storm happen to blow in the opposing direction of the ocean current the forces might be strong enough to randomly generate rogue waves. Theories of instability mechanisms for the generation and growth of wind waves—although not on the causes of rogue waves—are provided by Phillips&lt;ref name="JFM"&gt;Phillips 1957, ''[[Journal of Fluid Mechanics]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and Miles.&lt;ref name="Iopscience.iop.org_April_17_2016c"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JFM2"&gt;Miles, 1957, ''[[Journal of Fluid Mechanics]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Thermal expansion]] :When a stable wave group in a warm water column moves into a cold water column the size of the waves must change because energy must be conserved in the system. So each wave in the wave group become smaller because cold water holds more wave energy based on density. The waves are now spaced farther apart and because of gravity they will propagate into more waves to fill up the space and become a stable wave group. If a stable wave group exists in cold water and moves into a warm water column the waves will get larger and the wavelength will be shorter. The waves will seek equilibrium by attempting to displace the waves amplitude because of gravity. However, by starting with a stable wave group the wave energy can displace toward the center of the group. If both the front and back of the wave group are displacing energy toward the center it can become a rogue wave. This would happen only if the wave group is very large.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The spatio-temporal focusing seen in the NLS equation can also occur when the nonlinearity is removed. In this case, focusing is primarily due to different waves coming into phase, rather than any energy transfer processes. Further analysis of rogue waves using a fully nonlinear model by R. H. Gibbs (2005) brings this mode into question, as it is shown that a typical wavegroup focuses in such a way as to produce a significant wall of water, at the cost of a reduced height.

A rogue wave, and the deep trough commonly seen before and after it, may last only for some minutes before either breaking, or reducing in size again. Apart from one single rogue wave, the rogue wave may be part of a wave packet consisting of a few rogue waves. Such rogue [[wave group]]s have been observed in nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifremer.fr/web-com/stw2004/rw Frederic-Moreau. The Glorious Three], translated by M. Olagnon and G.A. Chase / Rogue Waves-2004, Brest, France&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three categories of freak waves:

* "Three Sisters", groups of three waves&lt;ref&gt;''Endeavour'' or ''Caledonian Star'' report, March 2, 2001, {{Coord|53|03|S|63|35|W|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific applications==
The possibility of the artificial stimulation of rogue wave phenomena has attracted research funding from [[DARPA]], an agency of the [[United States Department of Defense]]. [[Bahram Jalali]] and other researchers at [[UCLA]] studied microstructured [[optical fiber]]s near the threshold of [[soliton]] [[supercontinuum]] generation and observed rogue wave phenomena. After modelling the effect, the researchers announced that they had successfully characterized the proper initial conditions for generating rogue waves in any medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Reported encounters ==
{{Main|List of rogue waves}}
It should be noted that many of these encounters are only reported in the media, and are not examples of open ocean rogue waves. Often, in popular culture, an endangering huge wave is loosely denoted as a ''rogue wave'', while it has not been (and most often cannot be) established that the reported event is a rogue wave in the scientific sense — ''i.e.'' of a very different nature in characteristics as the surrounding waves in that [[sea state]] and with very low probability of occurrence (according to a [[Gaussian process]] description as valid for [[linear wave theory]]).

* {{SS|Edmund Fitzgerald}} (1975) – Lost on [[Lake Superior]]. A Coast Guard report blamed water entry to the hatches, which gradually filled the hold, or alternatively errors in navigation or charting causing damage from running onto [[shoal]]s. However, another nearby ship, the {{SS|Arthur M.

==Quantifying the impact of rogue waves on ships==

The loss of the [[MS München]] in 1978 provided some of the first physical evidence of the existence of rogue waves. The MS München was a state-of-the-art cargo ship with multiple water-tight compartments, an expert crew and was considered unsinkable. She was lost with all crew and the wreck has never been found. The only evidence found was the starboard lifeboat which was recovered from floating wreckage some time later. The lifeboats hung from forward and aft blocks {{convert|20|m|ft}} above the waterline. The pins had been bent back from forward to aft, indicating the lifeboat hanging below it had been struck by a wave that had run from fore to aft of the ship which had torn the lifeboat from the ship. To exert such force the wave must have been considerably higher than {{convert|20|m|ft}}. At the time of the inquiry, the existence of rogue waves was considered so statistically unlikely as to be near impossible. Consequently, the Maritime Court investigation concluded that the severe weather had somehow created an 'unusual event' that had led to the sinking of the München.&lt;ref name="BBCFreak"&gt;{{cite web

The 1980 loss of the [[MV Derbyshire|MV ''Derbyshire'']] during Typhoon Orchid south of Japan with the loss of all crew marked a turning point for ship design. The ''Derbyshire'' was an ore-bulk-oil combination carrier built in 1976. At 91,655 gross register tons, she was—and remains—the largest British ship ever to have been lost at sea. The wreck was found in June 1994. The survey team deployed a remotely operated vehicle to photograph the wreck. A private report was published in 1998 which prompted the British government to reopen a formal investigation into the sinking. The British government investigation included a comprehensive survey by the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] which took 135,774 pictures of the wreck during two surveys. The formal forensic investigation concluded that the ship sank because of structural failure and absolved the crew of any responsibility. Most notably, the report determined the detailed sequence of events that led to the structural failure of the vessel. A third comprehensive analysis was subsequently done by Douglas Faulkner, professor of marine architecture and ocean engineering at the [[University of Glasgow]]. His highly analytical and scientific report published in 2001 examined and linked the loss of the MV ''Derbyshire'' with what he called the emerging body of scientific evidence regarding the mechanics of freak waves. Professor Faulkner concluded that it was almost certain that ''Derbyshire'' would have encountered a wave of sufficient size to destroy her. Faulkner's conclusions have not been refuted in the more than 15 years since they were first presented (as of 2016). Indeed, subsequent analysis by others has corroborated his findings. Faulkner's finding that the ''Derbyshire'' was lost because of a rogue wave has had widespread implications on ship design.&lt;ref name="FaulknerD"/&gt; Faulkner has subsequently proposed the need for a paradigm shift in thinking for the design of ships and offshore installations to include what he calls a Survival Design approach additional to current design requirements. There is however no evidence that his recommendations have yet been adopted (as of 2016).&lt;ref name="FaulknerConference"&gt;{{cite conference

 | quote =In 1997, the Deep Submergence Operations Group of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution conducted an underwater forensic survey of the UK bulk carrier MV ''Derbyshire'' with a suite of underwater vehicles. This report describes the navigation systems and methodologies used to precisely position the vessel and vehicles. Precise navigation permits the survey team to control the path of the subsea vehicle in order to execute the survey plan, provides the ability to return to specific targets, and allows the assessment team to correlate observations made at different times from different vehicles. In this report, we summarize the techniques used to locate Argo as well as the repeatability of those navigation fixes. To determine repeatability, we selected a number of instances where the vehicle lines crossed. By registering two images from overlapping areas on different tracklines, we can determine the true position offset. By comparing the position offset derived from the images to the offsets obtained from navigation, we can determine the navigation error. The average error for 123 points across a single tie line was 3.1 meters, the average error for a more scattered selection of 18 points was 1.9 meters.

In 2004 an extreme wave was recorded impacting the Admiralty Breakwater, [[Alderney]] in the Channel Islands. This breakwater is exposed to the Atlantic Ocean. The peak pressure recorded by a shore-mounted transducer was 745 kPa which corresponds to a pressure of 74.5 tonnes/m2 or 74.5 Mt/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (metric tonnes per square metre). This pressure far exceeds almost any design criteria for modern ships and this wave would have destroyed almost any merchant vessel.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Soest.hawaii.edu_April_16_2016c"&gt;{{cite web

More recent work by Smith in 2007 confirmed prior forensic work by Faulkner in 1998 and determined that the MV ''Derbyshire'' was exposed to a hydrostatic pressure of a ''static head'' of water of about {{convert|20|m|ft}} with a resultant static pressure of 201&amp;nbsp;kN/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;A failure load pressure of 201 kN/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the same as 20,500 kgf/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 20.5 Mt/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (metric tonnes per square metre).&lt;/ref&gt; This is in effect 20 metres of green water (possibly a ''super rogue wave'')&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Note that the term ''super rogue wave'' had not yet been coined by ANU researchers at that time.&lt;/ref&gt; flowing over the vessel. The deck cargo hatches on the ''Derbyshire'' were determined to be the key point of failure when the rogue wave washed over the ship. The design of the hatches only allowed for a static pressure of less than two metres of water or 17.1&amp;nbsp;kN/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;A design load pressure (of the hatches) of 17.1 kN/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the same as 1,744 kgf/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 1.7 Mt/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (metric tonnes per square metre).&lt;/ref&gt; in other words the typhoon load on the hatches was more than ten (10) times the design load. The forensic structural analysis of the wreck of the ''Derbyshire'' is now widely regarded as irrefutable.&lt;ref name="SmithConference"/&gt;

In addition fast moving waves are now known to ''also'' exert extremely high dynamic pressure. It is known that plunging or breaking waves can cause short-lived impulse pressure spikes called Gifle peaks. These can reach pressures of 200&amp;nbsp;kN/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (or more) for milliseconds which is sufficient pressure to lead to brittle fracture of mild steel. Evidence of failure by this mechanism was also found on the ''Derbyshire''.&lt;ref name="FaulknerD"&gt;{{cite book

He reasoned that nothing could be more extraordinary than the violence of a fully arisen and chaotic storm tossed sea. He therefore studied the meteorology of revolving tropical storms and freak waves and found that steep elevated waves of 25 m to 30 m or more were quite likely to have occurred during typhoon Orchid.

==Ship failure mechanism==

Very few ship-wrecks have ever been fully investigated. The most recent bulk-carrier loss on the open seas to have been subjected to thorough investigation (as at March 2011) was the UK-owned M.V. ''Derbyshire'', which sank in 1980. Its entire crew of forty-four, all British citizens, perished. It took 14 years of pressure from the British public and a privately funded expedition to locate the wreck before a formal remote-camera search and investigation was done by the British government. At least a couple of hundred bulk carriers have been lost since 1980 and none have been properly investigated.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} A survey of 125 bulk carriers that sank between 1963 and 1996 found that seventy-six ''probably'' flooded, another four because of hatch-cover failure, the rest from ''unidentified'' causes. Nine other vessels broke completely in two. Causes of the remaining forty losses are unknown.&lt;ref name="Coldtype.net_April_17_2016c"&gt;{{cite web

Montgomery-Swan has outlined the generic mechanism of ship failure when encountering a rogue wave:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The scenario is very simple: the weight of the ship accelerates her down the back slope of the previous wave, the bow sticks into the lower part of the front of the giant incoming wave, and thousands of tons of green water fall onto the fore part of the ship. What happens next depends on the structure of the vessel.&lt;ref name="PowerBoating"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Professor Faulkner who did the forensic independent analysis of the loss of the M.V. ''Derbyshire'' explains why this is such a problem for bulk carriers. He states that "It is quite possible that some of the many unexplained heavy weather losses (of bulk carriers) may have been caused by hatch cover or coaming failures because fore end plunging due to flooding of large holds can be rapid." He noted in his report that "because of their high inertias and natural pitch periods, these large ships do not rise to the waves, as appropriately experienced masters have confirmed. They tend to bury into them." Faulkner concluded that "beyond any reasonable doubt, the direct cause of the loss of the M.V. ''Derbyshire'' was the quite inadequate strength of her cargo hatch covers to withstand the forces of Typhoon Orchid." He also noted that "It is not possible to say which of the eighteen covers failed first, or from which direction the waves came; but evidence and other arguments suggest that the no. 1 hatch covers were probably the first to yield, probably from waves over the bow with the ship hove-to."&lt;ref name="FaulknerD"/&gt;

==Design standards==

In November 1997 the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO) adopted  new rules covering survivability and structural requirements for bulk carriers of {{convert|150|m|ft|1}} and upwards. The bulkhead and double bottom must be strong enough to allow the ship to survive flooding in hold one unless loading is restricted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It is now widely held that rogue waves present considerable danger for several reasons: they are rare, unpredictable, may appear suddenly or without warning, and can impact with tremendous force. A {{convert|12|m|adj=on}} wave in the usual "linear" model would have a breaking force of {{convert|6|MT/m2|psi|abbr=~}}. Although modern ships are designed to (typically) tolerate a breaking wave of 15 MT/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a rogue wave can dwarf both of these figures with a breaking force far exceeding 100 MT/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="skuld" /&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Note that MT/m refers to metric tonnes per square metre.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith has presented calculations using the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) Common Structural Rules (CSR) for a typical bulk carrier which are consistent.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Smith has presented calculations for a hypothetical bulk carrier with a length of 275m and a displacement of 161,000 metric tonnes, the design Hydrostatic pressure, 8.75 m below waterline is 88 kN/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 88 kPa or 8.9 MT/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (metric tonnes per square metre). For the same carrier the design Hydrodynamic pressure is 122 kN/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 122 kPa or 12,440 kgf/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (kilograms of force per square metre) or 12.44 Mt/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (metric tonnes per square metre).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SmithConference"/&gt;

Peter Challenor, a leading scientist in this field from the National Oceanography Centre in the United Kingdom was quoted in Casey's book in 2010 that "We don’t have that random messy theory for nonlinear waves. At all", he says. "People have been working actively on this for the past 50 years at least. We don’t even have the start of a theory".&lt;ref name="TheWeek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Casey2010"/&gt;

In 2006 Smith proposed that the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) recommendation 34 pertaining to standard wave data be modified so that the minimum design wave height be increased to {{convert|65|ft|m|1}}. He presented analysis that there was sufficient evidence to conclude that {{convert|66|ft|m|1}} high waves can be experienced in the 25-year lifetime of oceangoing vessels, and that {{convert|98|ft|m|1}} high waves are less likely, but not out of the question. Therefore, a design criterion based on {{convert|36|ft|m|1}} high waves seems inadequate when the risk of losing crew and cargo is considered. Smith has also proposed that the dynamic force of wave impacts should be included in the structural analysis.&lt;ref name="SmithBook"&gt;{{cite book  | last      =  Smith

It is notable that the Norwegian offshore standards now take into account extreme severe wave conditions and require that a 10,000-year wave does not endanger the ships integrity.&lt;ref name="rosenthal"/&gt; Rosenthal notes that as at 2005 rogue waves were not explicitly accounted for in Classification Societies’ Rules for ships’ design.&lt;ref name="rosenthal"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Navy historically took the design position that the largest wave likely to be encountered was 21.4&amp;nbsp;m (70&amp;nbsp;ft). Smith observed in 2007 that the navy now believes that larger waves can occur and the possibility of extreme waves that are steeper (i.e. do not have longer wavelengths) is now recognized. The navy has not had to make any fundamental changes in ship design as a consequence of new knowledge of waves greater than 21.4&amp;nbsp;m (70&amp;nbsp;ft) because they build to higher standards.&lt;ref name="SmithConference"/&gt;

A characteristic of the shipping industry is that there are no uniform codes or international standards. There are more than 50 classification societies worldwide, each has different rules. Ship design has historically largely been led by the ship insurers who inspected, classified and insured vessels. Hence the widespread adoption of new rules to allow for the existence of rogue waves is likely to take many years.&lt;ref name="SmithConference"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2457">In the [[outline of physical science|physical sciences]], an '''interface''' is the boundary between two spatial regions occupied by different matter, or by matter in different physical states. The interface between matter and air, or matter and vacuum, is called a '''surface''', and studied in [[surface science]]. In [[thermal equilibrium]], the regions in contact are called [[phase (matter)|phases]], and the interface is called a [[phase boundary]]. An example for an interface out of equilibrium is the [[grain boundary]] in polycrystalline matter.

The importance of the interface depends on the type of system: the bigger the quotient area/volume, the greater the effect the interface will have. Consequently, interfaces are very important in systems with large interface area-to-volume ratios, such as [[colloid]]s.

Interfaces can be flat or curved. For example, [[oil]] droplets  in a [[salad dressing]] are spherical but the interface between water and air in a glass of water is mostly flat.

[[Surface tension]] is the physical property which rules interface processes involving liquids. For a liquid film on flat surfaces, the liquid-vapor interface keeps flat to minimize interfacial area and system [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]. For a liquid film on rough surfaces, the [[surface tension]] tends to keep the [[Meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]] flat, while the [[disjoining pressure]] makes the film conformal to the substrate. The equilibrium meniscus shape is a result of the competition between the [[capillary pressure]] and [[disjoining pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl5037066 Han Hu, Christopher R. Weinberger, and Ying Sun ''[[Nano Lett.]]'', 14 (12), pp 7131–7137 (2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Interfaces may cause various [[optical phenomena]], such as [[refraction]].  [[Lens (optics)|Optical lenses]] serve as an example of a practical application of the interface between [[glass]] and air.

One topical interface system is the gas-liquid interface between [[aerosols]] and other atmospheric molecules.

== History ==
A research group led by Professor Lars Berglund&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/acs.biomac.6b00145 | pmid=26942562 | volume=17 | issue=4 | title=Optically Transparent Wood from a Nanoporous Cellulosic Template: Combining Functional and Structural Performance | journal=Biomacromolecules | pages=1358–1364 | last1 = Li | first1 = Yuanyuan| year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from Swedish [[Royal Institute of Technology|KTH University]] along with a [[University of Maryland]] research group led by Professor Liangbing Hu&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Mingwei|last2=Song|first2=Jianwei|last3=Li|first3=Tian|last4=Gong|first4=Amy|last5=Wang|first5=Yanbin|last6=Dai|first6=Jiaqi|last7=Yao|first7=Yonggang|last8=Luo|first8=Wei|last9=Henderson|first9=Doug|date=2016-05-04|title=Highly Anisotropic, Highly Transparent Wood Composites|journal=Advanced Materials|language=en|volume=28|issue=26|pages=5181–5187|doi=10.1002/adma.201600427|pmid=27147136|issn=0935-9648}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liangbing Hu"&gt;url =http://www.bingnano.com/&lt;/ref&gt; have developed a method to remove the color and some [[chemical]]s from small [[wood|blocks of wood]], followed by adding [[polymer]]s, such as [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)]] and [[epoxy]], at the cellular level''',''' thereby rendering them transparent.

As soon as released in between 2015 and 2016, see-through wood had a large press reaction, with articles in ScienceDaily,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/03/160330085735.htm | title=Wood windows? Transparent wood material used for buildings, solar cells}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wired,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/transparent-wood-building-walls-solar-cells | title=This transparent wood could be used to build windows| journal=Wired UK| date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Wall Street Journal,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-could-we-build-with-extra-strong-see-through-wood-1461254815&lt;/ref&gt; the New York Times,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/science/see-through-wood.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; to name a few.

Actually those research groups rediscovered a work from Siegfried Fink, a German Researcher, from as early as 1992: with a process very similar to Berglund's and Hu's, the German Researcher turned wood transparent to reveal specific cavities of the wood structure for analytical purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fink|first=Siegfried|date=1992-01-01|title=Transparent Wood – A New Approach in the Functional Study of Wood Structure|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/hfsg.1992.46.issue-5/hfsg.1992.46.5.403/hfsg.1992.46.5.403.xml|journal=Holzforschung|volume=46|issue=5|pages=403–408|doi=10.1515/hfsg.1992.46.5.403|issn=1437-434X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The process==

Transparent wood was made based on the idea of removing light-absorbing components (mainly lignin) followed by infiltration of a polymer with a refractive index matching the wood substrate &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/adom.201800059 | volume=6 | issue=14 | title=Optically Transparent Wood: Recent Progress, Opportunities, and Challenges | journal=Advanced Optical Materials | pages=1800059 | last1 = Li | first1 = Yuanyuan| year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

One example is a three step process''':'''

The first step consists of immersing the 4 or 5 inch block of wood in a [[solution]] of [[water]], [[sodium hydroxide]], and [[sodium sulfite]] at [[boiling temperature]] for two hours. This enables the [[lignin]] in the cell walls to be leached out. "Lignins are particularly important in the formation of cell walls, especially in wood and bark, because they lend rigidity and do not rot easily".

The second step of oxidation with [[hydrogen peroxide]] completes the leaching of the lignin.

The third step consists of immersing the material in [[epoxy]] and putting it under alternating vacuum and atmospheric pressure; this fills the wood's natural but now disused [[nutrient]] and hydrating [[microscopic]] channels. The epoxy-filled microscopic channels create a material that has [[refraction|transparent refractive properties]].

The new material is rated stronger than [[plastic]], but is only in the [[laboratory]] and [[experimental]] stage, and not yet ready for commercial use.&lt;ref name=Fluer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Scharping/&gt;

The length of the process is determined by the size and species of the wood.

== Future ==
Transparent wood could transform architecture by enabling novel structures such as load-bearing windows. Such elements could also yield improvements in energy efficiency over glass or other traditional materials.

'''Diffuse field acoustic testing''' is the testing of the mechanical resistance of a spacecraft to the acoustic pressures during launch.

In the [[aerospace industry]], acoustic chambers are the main facilities for such tests. A chamber is a reverberant room that creates a diffuse sound field and is composed of an empty volume (from 1 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to 2900 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and a multifrequency sound generation system.

== Diffuse field principle==
Theoretically, diffuse field is defined as a [[Sound pressure]] field where there is no privileged direction of the energy. In other words, when sound pressure is the same everywhere in the room. This is obtained with large rooms with no absorbent materials on walls, ceiling or floor. Diffusion is enhanced in asymmetric rooms. To obtain such conditions, the room must be reverberant. The source's direct field must be negligible compared to the reverberant field, avoiding privileged propagation.&lt;ref name="potel"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Catherine |last1=Potel|first2=Michel|last2= Bruneau|title=Acoustique générale: équations différentielles et intégrales, solutions en milieux fluides et solides, applications|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=t8HUGAAACAAJ}}|year=2006|publisher=Ellipses|isbn=978-2-7298-2805-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reverberation time ===
{{see also|Reverberation}}
Reverberation is due to multiple reflections on walls with some delays that come back to the receptor. Summing up these contributions, a reverberant pressure field is created. The more reverberation, the more the field is diffused.

Two oft-used measures of reverberation time quantify this parameter,  : &lt;math&gt;RT_{30}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;RT_{60}&lt;/math&gt;. These values are the interval for the sound pressure level to the lower of 30 or 60 [[dBSPL]]. It can be obtained by measuring the sound pressure decrease after a sound impulse or by using approximate formulas such as Sabine's or Eyring's. In the case of a diffuse field (low absorption on the walls, and big volumes) Sabine's formula is used.

&lt;math&gt;RT_{60} = 0.16 \frac{V}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;A=\sum S\times \alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the equivalent absorption area involving the surface &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of the walls and their absorption coefficient &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Geometrical approach ===
{{see also|Geometrical acoustics}}
[[File:Reflexion spec diffuse wiki.jpg|thumb|Schematic representation of specular (in blue) and diffused (in green) reflections of an incident wave ray (in red)]]
Many theoretical ways to model sound propagation are used. One of these is the geometrical approach. This represents sound waves as a ray of energy propagating. When it meets an obstacle, this ray has two possible behaviors: It can be reflected following the normal of the plan, [[specular reflection]]. Alternatively it can be separated into many rays following a mathematical law (for example [[Lambert's law]]), [[diffused reflection]].

=== Quantities involving diffuse pressure field ===

Frequency is a main factor of a good diffused field. Some phenomena linked to frequency of the sound pressure field lead to poor homogeneity of a pressure field. The frequency response of a room is the amplification or reduction of some frequencies. It represents the repartition of pressure with respect to frequency. In low frequencies this can lead to mode apparition. These modes are due to standing waves that lead to maximum and minimum pressure according to the geometry of the room. To determine the frequency for which the pressure field can be considered diffused, [[Schroeder's frequency]] is commonly used. It is obtained considering the frequency from which the modal overlap exceeds &lt;math&gt;M=3&lt;/math&gt;. Below this frequency, the field is not diffuse and standing waves create pressure modes

&lt;math&gt;F_s = 2000\sqrt{\frac{RT_{60}}{V}} &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;RT_{60}&lt;/math&gt; is the reverberation time of the room and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; its volume.

[[File:Modes duct.jpg|thumb|Schematic transverse cut view of pressure modes in a duct (closed-closed)]]

For example, in the case of a rectangular room, low frequency modes are determined relative to the room dimensions as

&lt;math&gt;f_{lmn} = \frac{c_0}{2}\sqrt{\left(\frac{l}{L_x}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{m}{L_y}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{n}{L_z}\right)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

 
Where &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are respectively the mode of the length &lt;math&gt;L_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L_y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_z&lt;/math&gt; of the room and &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt; the [[Speed|celerity]] of sound in the working fluid.

== Aerospace application ==

Acoustic tests are mainly use for environmental tests on aircraft structures.&lt;ref name="tustin"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Wayne |last1=Tustin|first2=Robert|last2= Mercado|title=Random vibration in perspective|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=w4EoAQAAMAAJ}}|date=1 August 1984|publisher=Tustin Institute of Technology|isbn=978-0-918247-00-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satellites are expensive products with high-engineering built-in components.&lt;ref name="MaralBousquet2009"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Gerard |last1=Maral|first2=Michel|last2= Bousquet|title=Satellite Communications Systems: Systems, Techniques and Technology|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=pGA8ngEACAAJ}}|year=2009|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-71458-4|edition=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; To improve the resistance of a spacecraft during launch and during its orbital life, analysis is focused on tests in three categories : [[Spacecraft thermal control|Thermal]], [[Radio frequency|Radio-frequencies]] and [[Vibration]]s. This last test area is focused on the mechanical stresses that the specimen will meet during its life, especially during launch.

Acoustics creates mechanical stresses during the first five seconds. Sound pressure levels can go up to 150 dBSPL. Acoustic tests are used to verify the mechanical resistance of the satellite and its elements to acoustic pressures generated.

=== Accelerometer measurement ===
{{see also|Vibration#Vibration testing}}
Once the sound generation system is working, acceleration measurement is performed by accelerometers placed on the specimen.

== Acoustic chamber ==

=== Sound generation ===
To test a satellite, a sound generation system generates a broadband spectrum ([25&amp;nbsp;Hz-10000]Hz) simulating the maximum envelope of all launchers that the satellite may fly in. To qualify, three tests are realized with changing global gain compared to launcher spectrum:
* Low-Level : - 8&amp;nbsp;dB SPL
* Intermediate : - 4&amp;nbsp;dB SPL
* PFM (Proto Flight Model) : 0&amp;nbsp;dB SPL

Before testing the satellite, an empty room test is performed to check the chamber's signature.

This pressure field is generated by multifrequency sirens powered by [[nitrogen]] or [[compressed air]] modulators. This system can generate sound pressure levels up to 160 dBSPL. Each acoustic chamber has its own configurations, but each siren is centered on a frequency where sound pressure levels are the highest. In some cases these sirens can be completed with electroacoustic systems to generate and control midrange and high frequencies. Sirens generate low frequencies, but with high sound pressure levels [[distortion]] appears that leads to higher harmonics. Loudspeakers are used in some chambers to control these frequencies.

To produce exact levels, piloting microphones check sound pressure levels and apply a realtime gain correction to adjust the level.

=== Advantages ===
* Homogeneity : Spatial homogeneity guaranteed for ± 1.5 dBSPL
* Low frequency generation : Very efficient low frequency generation (below 50&amp;nbsp;Hz)
* Security : Control with piloting microphones that adjust the level or abort if needed
* Representativeness : Faithful to real stresses during launch
* Well known process : Used by many aerospace industries 

=== Disadvantages ===
* Gas generation : May require large amounts of nitrogen
* High frequency control : If no high frequency sirens or electroacoustic devices are included, only harmonics generated by distortion produce mid and high frequencies.

''{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2016}}''

In [[physics]], an [[energy]] well describes a 'stable' equilibrium that is not at lowest possible energy.

In general, modern physics holds the view that the universe - and systems therein -  spontaneously drives toward a state of lower energy, if possible.  For example, a bowling ball pitched atop a smooth hump (which has potential energy in the presence of [[gravity]]), will tend to roll down to the lowest point it possibly can.  Once there, this reduces the total [[potential energy]] of the system.

On the other hand, if the bowling ball is resting in a valley between two humps - no matter how big the drops outside the humps - it will stay there indefinitely.  Even though the system could achieve a lower energy state, it cannot do so without external energy being applied: (locally) it is at its lowest energy state, and only a force from outside the system can 'push' it over one of the humps so a lower state can be achieved.

The concept of an energy well is a key part of teaching basic physics, especially [[quantum mechanics]].  Here, students often solve the one-dimensional [[Schrödinger Equation]] for an [[electron]] trapped in a potential well from which it has insufficient energy to escape.  The solution to this problem is a series of [[sinusoidal]] waves of fractional integral [[wavelengths]] determined by the width of the well.

In [[solid state physics]] the '''electron heat capacity''' or '''electronic specific heat''' describes the contribution of electrons to the [[heat capacity]]. 
Heat is transported by [[phonon]]s and by free electrons in solids. For pure metals, however, the electronic contributions dominate in the [[thermal conductivity]]. In impure metals, the electron mean free path is reduced by collisions with impurities, and the phonon contribution may be comparable with the electronic contribution.

== Introduction ==

Although the [[Drude model]] was fairly successful in describing the electron motion within metals, it has some erroneous aspects: it predicts the [[Hall coefficient]] with the wrong sign compared to experimental measurements, the assumed additional electronic heat capacity to the lattice [[heat capacity]], namely &lt;math&gt; \frac{3}{2} k_{\rm B} &lt;/math&gt; per electron at elevated temperatures, is also inconsistent with experimental values, since measurements of metals show no deviation from the [[Dulong-Petit law]]. The observed electronic contribution of electrons to the heat capacity is usually less than one percent of &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{2} k_{\rm B} &lt;/math&gt;. This problem seemed insoluble prior to the development of [[quantum mechanics]]. This paradox was solved by [[Sommerfeld]] after the discovery of the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], who recognised that the replacement of the [[Boltzmann distribution]] with the [[Fermi-Dirac distribution]] was required and incorporated it in the [[free electron model]].

== Derivation within the free electron model ==

=== Internal energy ===
When a metallic system is heated from absolute zero, not every electron gains an energy &lt;math&gt; k_{\rm B}T &lt;/math&gt; as [[equipartition]] dictates. Only those electrons in [[atomic orbitals]] within an energy range of &lt;math&gt; \frac{3}{2} k_{\rm B}T &lt;/math&gt; of the [[Fermi level]] are thermally excited. Electrons, in contrast to a classical gas, can only move into free states in their energetic neighbourhood.
The one-electron energy levels are specified by the [[wave vector]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; through the relation &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(k)=\hbar^2k^2/2m&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; the electron mass. This relation separates the occupied energy states from the unoccupied ones and corresponds to the spherical surface in [[Reciprocal space|'''k'''-space]]. As &lt;math&gt;T\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; the [[ground state]] distribution becomes:

&lt;math&gt;f = \begin{cases}
  1 &amp; \mbox{if } \epsilon_f&lt;\mu, \\
  0 &amp; \mbox{if } \epsilon_f&gt;\mu. \\
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Fermi-Dirac distribution]]
*&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_f&lt;/math&gt; is the energy of the energy level corresponding to the [[ground state]]
*&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the ground state energy in the limit &lt;math&gt;T\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;, which thus still deviates from the true [[ground state]] energy.

This implies that the ground state is the only occupied state for electrons in the limit &lt;math&gt;T\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;f=1&lt;/math&gt; takes the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] into account. The [[internal energy]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of a system within the free electron model is given by the sum over one-electron levels times the mean number of electrons in that level:

&lt;math&gt;U=2\sum_k \epsilon(\mathbf{k})f(\epsilon(\mathbf{k}))&lt;/math&gt;

=== Reduced internal energy and electron density ===
Using the approximation that for a sum over a smooth function &lt;math&gt;F(k)&lt;/math&gt; over all allowed values of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; for finite large system is given by:

&lt;math&gt;F(\mathbf{k})=\frac{V}{8\pi^3}\sum_k F(\mathbf{k})\Delta \mathbf{k} &lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the system

For the reduced internal energy &lt;math&gt;u=U/V&lt;/math&gt; the expression for &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; can be rewritten as:

&lt;math&gt;u=\int \frac{d\mathbf{k}}{4\pi^3}\epsilon(\mathbf{k})f(\epsilon(\mathbf{k}))&lt;/math&gt;

and the expression for the electron density &lt;math&gt;n=\frac{N}{V}&lt;/math&gt; can be written as:

&lt;math&gt; n=\int\frac{d\mathbf{k}}{4\pi^3}f(\epsilon(\mathbf{k}))&lt;/math&gt;

The integrals above can be evaluated using the fact that the dependence of the integrals on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; can be changed to dependence on &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; through the relation for the electronic energy when described as [[Free particle|free particles]], &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(k)=\hbar^2k^2/2m&lt;/math&gt;, which yields for an arbitrary function &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;  \int\frac{d\mathbf{k}}{4\pi^3}G(\epsilon(\mathbf{k})) = \int_0^\infty \frac{k^2dk}{\pi^2}G(\epsilon(\mathbf{k}))= \int_{-\infty}^\infty d\epsilon D(\epsilon)G(\epsilon)  &lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;D(\epsilon) = \begin{cases}
  \frac{m}{\hbar^2\pi^2}\sqrt{\frac{2m\epsilon}{\hbar^2}} &amp; \mbox{if } \epsilon&gt;0, \\
  0 &amp; \mbox{if } \epsilon&lt;0 \\
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
which is known as the density of levels or density of states per unit volume such that &lt;math&gt;D(\epsilon) d \epsilon &lt;/math&gt; is the total number of states between &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon+ d\epsilon &lt;/math&gt; . Using the expressions above the integrals can be rewritten as:

&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
u&amp;=\int_{-\infty}^\infty d\epsilon D(\epsilon)\epsilon f(\epsilon) \\
n&amp;=\int_{-\infty}^\infty d\epsilon D(\epsilon)f(\epsilon) 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These integrals can be evaluated for temperatures that are small compared to the [[Fermi temperature]] by applying the [[Sommerfeld expansion]] and using the approximation that &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; differs from &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_f&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;T=0&lt;/math&gt; by terms of order &lt;math&gt;T^2&lt;/math&gt;. The expressions become:

&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
u&amp;=\int_0^{\epsilon_f} \epsilon D(\epsilon)d\epsilon + \epsilon_f  \left(   (\mu-\epsilon_f )D(\epsilon_f)+ \frac{\pi^2}{6}(k_{\rm B}T)^2 \dot D(\epsilon_f)\right)  + \frac{\pi^2}{6}(k_{\rm B}T)^2 D(\epsilon_f)+ \mathcal{O}(T^4) \\
n&amp;=\int_0^{\epsilon_f} D(\epsilon)d\epsilon +  \left(   (\mu-\epsilon_f )D(\epsilon_f)+ \frac{\pi^2}{6}(k_{\rm B}T)^2 \dot D(\epsilon_f)\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For the ground state configuration the first terms (the integrals) of the expressions above yield the internal energy and electron density of the ground state. The expression for the electron density reduces to &lt;math&gt;( \mu-\epsilon_f )D(\epsilon_f)+ \frac{\pi^2}{6}(k_{\rm B}T)^2 \dot D(\epsilon_f)=0 &lt;/math&gt;. Substituting this into the expression for the internal energy, one finds the following expression:

&lt;math&gt;u=u_0+\frac{\pi^2}{6}(k_{\rm B}T)^2D(\epsilon_f) &lt;/math&gt;

=== Final expression === 
The contributions of electrons within the free electron model is given by:

&lt;math&gt;C_v=\left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial T} \right)_n = \frac{\pi^2}{3} k_{\rm B}^2TD(\epsilon_f)&lt;/math&gt;, for free electrons : &lt;math&gt; C_V = C_v / n = \frac{\pi^2}{2} \frac{k_{\rm B}^2T}{\epsilon_f} &lt;/math&gt;

Compared to the classical result &lt;math&gt; C_V=\frac{3}{2}k_{\rm B}&lt;/math&gt; it can be concluded that this result is depressed by a factor of &lt;math&gt; \frac{\pi^2}{3} \frac{k_{\rm B}T}{\epsilon_f} &lt;/math&gt; which is at room temperature of order of magnitude &lt;math&gt;10^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;. This explains the absence of an electronic contribution to the heat capacity as measured experimentally.

Note that in this derivation &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_f&lt;/math&gt; is often denoted by &lt;math&gt;E_{\rm F}&lt;/math&gt; which is known as the [[Fermi energy]]. In this notation, the electron heat capacity becomes:

&lt;math&gt;C_v= \frac{\pi^2}{3} k_{\rm B}^2TD(E_{\rm F})&lt;/math&gt; and for free electrons : &lt;math&gt; C_V = \frac{\pi^2}{2}k_{\rm B} \left( \frac{k_{\rm B}T}{E_{\rm F}} \right) = \frac{\pi^2}{2} k_{\rm B}\left( \frac{T}{T_{\rm F}} \right) &lt;/math&gt; using the definition for the [[Fermi energy]] with &lt;math&gt; T_{\rm F} &lt;/math&gt; the [[Fermi temperature]].

== Comparison with experimental results for the heat capacity of metals ==

For temperatures below both the [[Debye temperature]] &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm D}&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Fermi temperature]] &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm F}&lt;/math&gt; the heat capacity of metals can be written as a sum of electron and [[phonon]] contributions that are linear and cubic respectively: &lt;math&gt;C_V=\gamma T +AT^3&lt;/math&gt;. The coefficient &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated and determined experimentally. Some values are tabulated below:

The free electrons in a metal do not usually lead to a strong deviation from the [[Dulong–Petit law]] at high temperatures. Since &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is linear in &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is linear in &lt;math&gt;T^3&lt;/math&gt;, at low temperatures the lattice contribution vanishes faster than the electronic contribution and the latter can be measured. The deviation of the approximated and experimentally determined electronic contribution to the heat capacity of a metal is not too large. A few metals deviate significantly from this approximated prediction. Measurements indicate that these errors are associated with the electron mass being somehow changed in the metal, for the calculation of the electron heat capacity the [[Effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] of an electron should be considered instead. For Fe and Co the large deviations are attributed to the partially filled [[d-shells]] of these [[transition metals]], whose d-bands lie at the [[Fermi energy]].
The [[alkali metal]]s are expected to have the best agreement with the free electron model since these metals only one s-electron outside a closed shell. However even sodium, which is considered to be the closest to a free electron metal, is determined to have a &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; more than 25 per cent higher than expected from the theory.

Certain effects influence the deviation from the approximation:
* The interaction of the conduction electrons with the periodic potential of the rigid crystal lattice is neglected.
* The interaction of the conduction electrons with phonons is also neglected. This interaction causes changes in the effective mass of the electron and therefore it affects the electron energy.
* The interaction of the conduction electrons with themselves is also ignored. A moving electron causes an inertial reaction in the surrounding electron gas.

== Heat capacity of superconductors ==

[[Superconductivity]] occurs in many metallic elements of the periodic system and also in alloys, [[intermetallic]] compounds, and doped [[semiconductors]]. This effect occurs upon cooling the material. The [[entropy]] decreases on cooling below the critical temperature &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt; for [[superconductivity]] which indicates that the superconducting state is more ordered than the normal state. The entropy change is small, this must mean that only a very small fraction of electrons participate in the transition to the superconducting state but, the electronic contribution to the heat capacity changes drastically. There is a sharp jump of the heat capcacity at the critical temperature while for the temperatures above the critical temperature the heat capacity is linear with temperature.

=== Calculation for a superconductor ===
The calculation of the electron heat capacity for super conductors can be done in the [[BCS theory]]. The entropy of a system of [[fermionic]] [[quasiparticles]], in this case [[Cooper pairs]], is:

&lt;math&gt; S(T)=-2k_{\rm B} \sum_k[f_k \ln f_k +(1-f_k) \ln(1-f_k)] &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f_k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Fermi-Dirac distribution]] &lt;math&gt; f_k=\frac{1}{e^{\beta \omega_k}+1}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\omega_k=\sqrt{\epsilon_k^2+\Delta_k(T)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
and
* &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_k=E_K-\mu=\hbar^2\mathbf{k}^2/2m -\mu &lt;/math&gt; is the particle energy with respect to the [[Fermi energy]] 
* &lt;math&gt;\Delta_k(T) =-\sum_{kk'}u_{k'}v_{k'}&lt;/math&gt; the energy gap parameter where &lt;math&gt;u_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_k&lt;/math&gt; represents the probability that a [[Cooper pair]] is occupied or unoccupied respectively.

The heat capacity is given by &lt;math&gt; C_v(T)=T\frac{\partial S(T)}{\partial T}=T\sum_k \frac{\partial S}{\partial f_k}\frac{\partial f_k}{\partial T} &lt;/math&gt;.
The last two terms can be calculated:

&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\frac{\partial S}{\partial f_k} &amp;=-2k_{\rm B} \ln\frac{f_k}{1-f_k}=2\frac{1}{T} \sqrt{\epsilon_k^2+\Delta_k(T)^2}\\
\frac{\partial f_k}{\partial T} &amp;= \frac{1}{k_{\rm B} T^2} \frac{e^{\beta \omega_k}}{(e^{\beta \omega_k}+1)^2}\left( \sqrt{\epsilon_k^2+\Delta_k(T)^2}-T\frac{\partial}{\partial T} \sqrt{\epsilon_k^2+\Delta_k(T)^2} \right) \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this in the expression for the heat capacity and again applying that the sum over &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; in the reciprocal space can be replaced by an integral in &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; multipied by the [[density of states]] &lt;math&gt; D(E_{\rm F})&lt;/math&gt; this yields:

&lt;math&gt; C_v(T)=\frac{2D(E_{\rm F})}{k_{\rm B} T^2}\int^\infty_{-\infty} \left[ \frac{e^{\sqrt{\epsilon_k^2+\Delta_k(T)^2}}}{(e^{\sqrt{\epsilon_k^2+\Delta_k(T)^2}}+1)^2} \left( \epsilon_k^2 + \Delta_k(T)^2 -\frac{T}{2} \frac{\partial}{\partial T} \Delta_k(T)^2 \right) \right] d\epsilon_k&lt;/math&gt;

=== Characteristic behaviour for superconductors ===
To examine the typical behaviour of the electron heat capacity for species that can transition to the superconducting state, three regions must be defined:

# Above the critical temperature&lt;math&gt; T&gt;T_c &lt;/math&gt; 
# At the critical temperature &lt;math&gt; T=T_c &lt;/math&gt; 
# Below the critical temperature &lt;math&gt; T&lt;T_c &lt;/math&gt;

==== Superconductors at &lt;math&gt; T&gt;T_c &lt;/math&gt; ====
For &lt;math&gt; T&gt;T_c &lt;/math&gt; it holds that &lt;math&gt; \Delta_k(T)=0 &lt;/math&gt; and the electron heat capacity becomes:

&lt;math&gt;  C_v(T)=\frac{4D(E_{\rm F})}{k_{\rm B} T^2}\int^\infty_{-\infty}\frac{e^{\beta \epsilon}}{(e^{\beta \epsilon}+1)^2} \epsilon^2 d\epsilon=\frac{\pi^2}{3}D(E_{\rm F})k_{\rm B}^2T &lt;/math&gt;

This is just the result for a normal metal derived in the section above, as expected since a [[superconductor]] behaves as a normal conductor above the critical temperature.

==== Superconductors at &lt;math&gt; T&lt;T_c &lt;/math&gt; ====
For &lt;math&gt; T&lt;T_c &lt;/math&gt; the electron heat capacity for super conductors exhibits an exponential decay of the form:
&lt;math&gt; C_v(T)\approx e^{-\beta \Delta_k(0)} &lt;/math&gt;

==== Superconductors at &lt;math&gt; T=T_c &lt;/math&gt; ====
At the critical temperature the heat capacity is discontinuous. This discontinuity in the heat capacity indicates that the transition for a material from normal conducting to superconducting is a [[second order phase transition]].

More recent research has found that since both the Fermi function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and the electronic density of states &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; vary with &lt;math&gt;T_e&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ji|first=Pengfei|last2=Zhang|first2=Yuwen|year=2016|title=Continuum-atomistic simulation of picosecond laser heating of copper with electron heat capacity from ab initio calculation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009261416300100|journal=Chemical Physics Letters|volume=648|pages=109–113|doi=10.1016/j.cplett.2016.02.003|arxiv=1602.01180|bibcode=2016CPL...648..109J}}&lt;/ref&gt; a more exact expression for &lt;math&gt;C_e&lt;/math&gt; is the following equation at given &lt;math&gt;T_e&lt;/math&gt;

In [[rheology]], the '''Farris Effect''' describes the decrease of the viscosity of a suspension upon increasing the dispersity of the solid additive, at constant volume fraction of the solid additive. That is, that a broader particle size distribution yields a lower viscosity than a narrow particle size distribution, for the same concentration of particles. The phenomenon is names after Richard J. Farris, who modeled the effect.&lt;ref name="Farris1968"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farris|first1=Richard J|title=Prediction of the Viscosity of Multimodal Suspensions from Unimodal Viscosity Data|journal=Transactions of the Society of Rheology|date=1968|volume=12|issue=2|pages=281–301|doi=10.1122/1.549109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is relevant whenever suspensions are flowing, particularly for suspensions with high loading fractions. Examples include [[hydraulic fracturing]] fluids, [[metal injection molding]] feedstocks, cosmetics, and various geological processes including sedimentation and lava flows.&lt;ref name="DelGaudio2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Del Gaudio|first1=P|last2=Ventura|first2=G|last3=Taddeucci|first3=J|title=The effect of particle size on the rheology of liquid-solid mixtures with application to lava flows : Results from analogue experiments|journal=Geochemistry Geophysics Geosystems|date=2013|volume=14|issue=8|pages=2661–2669|doi=10.1002/ggge.20172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5217">{{Distinguish|Areometer}}
An '''aerometer''' is an instrument designed to measure the density (among other parameters) of the [[air]] and some gases.&lt;ref name="Marshall"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;«[http://www.enciclopedia.cat/EC-GEC-0075236.xml aerometer]».&amp;#x20;&lt;/ref&gt;

The word '''aerometer''' (or Ärometer, from Ancient Greek ἀήρ -aer "[[Atmosphere of Earth|air]]" and μέτρον -métron "measure, scale") refers to various types of devices for measuring or handling of gases. The instruments designated with this name can be used to find: the density, the flow, the amount or some other parameter of the [[air]] or a determined gas.&lt;ref name="Marshall"/&gt;

Another instrument called '''[[areometer]]''' (from Ancient Greek ἀραιός -araiós "[[Density|lightness]]" and μέτρον -métron "measure, scale"), also known as '''[[hydrometer]]''', used for measuring liquids [[density]], is often confused with the term '''aerometer'''  here defined.

Homeokinetic physics studies the up-down processes that bind these levels. Tools such as [[mechanics]], [[quantum field theory]], and the laws of [[thermodynamics]] provide the key relationships. The subject, described as the physics and thermodynamics associated with the up down movement between levels of systems, originated in the late 1970s work of American physicists [[Harry Soodak]] and [[Arthur Iberall]]. Complex systems are [[universes]], [[galaxies]], [[social systems]], [[people]], or even those that seem as simple as [[gases]]. The basic premise is that the entire universe consists of atomistic-like units bound in interactive ensembles to form systems, level by level, in a nested hierarchy. Homeokinetics treats all complex systems on an equal footing, animate and inanimate, providing them with a common viewpoint. The complexity in studying how they work is reduced by the emergence of common languages in all complex systems.&lt;ref name=Homeok2016/&gt;

==History==
[[Arthur Iberall]], [[Warren McCulloch]] and [[Harry Soodak]] developed the concept of homeokinetics as a new branch of physics.  It began through Iberall's biophysical research for the NASA [[exobiology]] program into the dynamics of mammalian physiological processes&lt;ref&gt;Iberall, A.S. and S.Z. Cardon. Analysis of the dynamic systems response of some internal human systems. Clearinghouse for Federal Scientific and Technical Information; Reports to NASA: CR-129, Oct. 1964; CR-141, Jan. l965; CR-219, May 1965; Interim Report, Dec. 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iberall, A.S., M. Ehrenberg and S.Z. Cardon. General-dynamics of the physical-chemical systems in mammals. Contractors Report to NASA, NASW-1066, Aug. 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; They were observing an area that physics has neglected, that of complex systems with their very long internal factory day delays. They were observing systems associated with nested [[hierarchy]] and with an extensive range of time scale processes.&lt;ref&gt;Iberall, A.S. and S.Z. Cardon. Hierarchical regulation in the complex biological organism. Record of the IEEE Systems Science and Cybernetics Conference, Phila., October, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iberall, A.S. and W.S. McCulloch. The organizing principle of complex living systems. J. Basic Engr., ASME 290-294, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; It was such connections, referred to as both up-down or in-out connections (as nested hierarchy) and side-side or flatland physics among atomistic-like components (as [[heterarchy]]) that became the hallmark of homeokinetic problems. By 1975, they began to put a formal catch-phrase name on those complex problems, associating them with [[nature]], [[life]], [[human]], [[mind]], and [[society]]. The major method of exposition that they began using was a combination of engineering physics and a more academic pure physics. In 1981, Iberall was invited to the Crump Institute for Medical Engineering of [[UCLA]], where he further refined the key concepts of homeokinetics, developing a physical scientific foundation for complex systems.

==Self-organizing Complex Systems==

A system is a collective of interacting ‘atomistic’-like entities.&lt;ref name=Homeok2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=homeo/&gt; The word ‘atomism’ is used to stand both for the entity and the doctrine. As is known from ‘kinetic’ theory, in mobile or simple systems, the atomisms share their ‘energy’ in interactive collisions. That so-called ‘equipartitioning’ process takes place within a few collisions. Physically, if there is little or no interaction, the process is considered to be very weak. Physics deals basically with the forces of interaction—few in number—that influence the interactions. They all tend to emerge with considerable force at high ‘density’ of atomistic interaction. In complex systems, there is also a result of internal processes in the atomisms. They exhibit, in addition to the pair-by-pair interactions, internal actions such as [[vibrations]], [[rotations]], and association. If the energy and time involved internally creates a very large—in time—cycle of performance of their actions compared to their pair interactions, the collective system is complex. If you eat a cookie and you do not see the resulting action for hours, that is complex; if boy meets girl and they become ‘engaged’ for a protracted period, that is complex. What emerges from that physics is a broad host of changes in state and stability transitions in state. Viewing [[Aristotle]] as having defined a general basis for systems in their static-logical states and trying to identify a logic-metalogic for physics, e.g., [[metaphysics]], then homeokinetics is viewed to be an attempt to define the dynamics of all those systems in the universe.

==Flatland physics vs Homeokinetic physics==

Ordinary physics is a flatland physics, a physics at some particular level. Examples include nuclear and atomic physics, biophysics, social physics, and stellar physics. Homeokinetic physics combines flatland physics with the study of the up down processes that binds the levels.&lt;ref name="primer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeokinetics.org/pdf%20files/HomeokineticsPrimer.pdf|title=Primer on Homeokinetics: A Physical Foundation for Complex Systems|author=Arthur Iberall and Harry Soodak|publisher=Cri-de-Coeur Press|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tools, such as mechanics, quantum field theory, and the laws of thermodynamics, provide key relationships for the binding of the levels, how they connect, and how the energy flows up and down. And whether the atomisms are atoms, molecules, cells, people, stars, galaxies, or universes, the same tools can be used to understand them. Homeokinetics treats all complex systems on an equal footing, animate and inanimate, providing them with a common viewpoint. The complexity in studying how they work is reduced by the emergence of common languages in all complex systems.

==Applications==
A homeokinetic approach to complex systems has been applied to ecological psychology,&lt;ref&gt;Iberall, A., A physical (homeokinetic) foundation for the Gibsonian theory of perception and action, Ecolog. Psychol. 7(1): 37-68, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; anthropology, geology,

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6781">The '''center of percussion''' is the point on an extended massive object attached to a pivot where a [[perpendicular]] impact will produce no reactive shock at the pivot.   Translational and rotational motions cancel at the pivot when an impulsive blow is struck at the center of percussion.   The center of percussion is often discussed in the context of a bat, [[racquet]], door, [[sword]] or other extended object held at one end. 

The same point is called the '''center of oscillation''' for the object suspended from the pivot as a [[pendulum]], meaning that a simple pendulum with all its mass concentrated at that point will have the same period of oscillation as the compound pendulum.  In sports, the center of percussion of a bat or racquet is related to the so-called "[[sweet spot (sports)|sweet spot]]", but the latter is also related to vibrational bending of the object.

==Explanation==
[[File:CenterOfPercussion2.svg|thumb|upright=2.0|Effects of a blow on a hanging beam. CP is the Center of Percussion, and CM is the Center of Mass of the beam.]]
Imagine a rigid beam suspended from a wire by a fixture that can slide freely along the wire at point P, as shown in the Figure. An impulsive blow is applied from the left.  If it is below the [[center of mass]] (CM) it will cause the beam to rotate counterclockwise around the CM and also cause the CM to move to the right. The center of percussion (CP) is below the CM.  If the blow falls above the CP, the rightward translational motion will be bigger than the leftward rotational motion at P, causing the net initial motion of the fixture to be rightward.  If the blow falls below the CP the opposite will occur, rotational motion at P will be larger than translational motion and the fixture will move initially leftward. Only if the blow falls exactly on the CP will the two components of motion cancel out to produce zero net initial movement at point P.  

When the sliding fixture is replaced with a pivot that cannot move left or right, an impulsive blow anywhere but at the CP results in an initial reactive force at the pivot.  

==Calculating the center of percussion==
For a free, rigid beam, an impulse &lt;math&gt;F dt&lt;/math&gt; applied at [[right angle]] at a distance &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; from the [[center of mass]] (CM) will result in the CM changing velocity &lt;math&gt;dv_{cm}&lt;/math&gt; according to the relation:

:&lt;math&gt;F=M\frac{dv_{cm}}{dt},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the beam. Similarly, the [[torque]] about the CM will change the [[angular velocity]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; according to:

:&lt;math&gt;Fb=I\frac{d\omega}{dt},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the [[moment of inertia]] around the CM.

For any point P a distance &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; on the opposite side of the CM from the point of impact, the change in velocity of point P  is

:&lt;math&gt;dv_{net} = dv_{cm} - p d\omega\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the distance of P from the CM. Hence the acceleration at P due to the impulsive blow is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv_{net}}{dt}=\left(\frac{1}{M}-\frac{pb}{I}\right)F.&lt;/math&gt;

When this acceleration is zero, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; defines the center of percussion. Therefore, the CP distance, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, from the CM, is given by

:&lt;math&gt;b=\frac{I}{pM}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that P, the rotation axis, need not be at the end of the beam, but can be chosen at any distance &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.   

Length &lt;math&gt;b + p&lt;/math&gt; also defines the [[center of oscillation]] of a [[physical pendulum]], that is, the position of the mass of a simple pendulum that has the same period as the physical pendulum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kettering.edu/~drussell/bats-new/cop.html |title=What is the COP and does it matter? |website=Physics and Acoustics of Baseball &amp; Softball Bats |author=Daniel A. Russell |publisher=[[Pennsylvania State University]] |accessdate=May 24, 2012 |date=June 16, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405195740/http://www.kettering.edu/~drussell/bats-new/cop.html |archivedate=April 5, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Center of percussion of a uniform beam==

For the special case of a beam of uniform density of length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, the moment of inertia around the CM is:

:&lt;math&gt;I=\frac{1}{12}ML^2&lt;/math&gt; (see [[moment of inertia]] for proof), 

and for rotation about a pivot at the end, 

:&lt;math&gt; p = L/2&lt;/math&gt;.

This leads to:

:&lt;math&gt;b=\frac{L^2}{12p} = \frac{1}{6}L&lt;/math&gt;.

It follows that the CP is 2/3 of the length of the uniform beam &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; from the pivoted end.  

==Some applications==

For example, a swinging door that is stopped by a doorstop placed 2/3 of the width of the door will do the job with minimal shaking of the door because the hinged end is subjected to no net reactive force.  (This point is also the node in the second vibrational harmonic, which also minimizes vibration.)

The [[sweet spot (sports)|sweet spot]] on a [[baseball]] bat is generally defined as the point at which the impact ''feels'' best to the batter.   The center of percussion defines a place where, if the bat strikes the ball and the batter's hands are at the pivot point, the batter feels no sudden reactive force.  However, since a bat is not a rigid object the vibrations produced by the impact also play a role.    Also, the pivot point of the swing may not be at the place where the batter's hands are placed.   Research has shown that the dominant physical mechanism in determining where the sweet spot is arises from the location of nodes in the vibrational modes of the bat, not the location of the center of percussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rod Cross |year=2004 |title=Center of percussion of hand-held implements |journal=[[American Journal of Physics]] |volume=72 |issue=5 |pages=622–630 |url=http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/~cross/PUBLICATIONS/26.%20COPHandHeld.PDF |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |doi=10.1119/1.1634965 |bibcode=2004AmJPh..72..622C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The center of percussion concept can be applied to [[sword]]s.  Being flexible objects, the "sweet spot" for such cutting weapons depends not only on the center of percussion but also on the flexing and vibrational characteristics.

The temperature and physical expression of the Verwey transition are highly sensitive to the stress state of magnetite and the [[stoichiometry]].

'''Computational anatomy''' is an interdisciplinary field of [[biology]] focused on quantitative investigation and modelling of anatomical shapes variability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://team.inria.fr/asclepios/research/computational-anatomy/|title=Computational Anatomy – Asclepios|website=team.inria.fr|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://icm.jhu.edu/research-areas-2/computational-anatomy/|title=JHU – Institute for Computational Medicine {{!}} Computational Anatomy|website=icm.jhu.edu|access-date=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the development and application of mathematical, statistical and data-analytical methods for modelling and simulation of biological structures.

The field is broadly defined and includes foundations in [[anatomy]], [[applied mathematics]] and [[pure mathematics]], [[machine learning]], [[computational mechanics]], [[computational science]], [[biological imaging]], [[neuroscience]], [[physics]], [[probability]], and [[statistics]]; it also has strong connections with [[fluid mechanics]] and [[geometric mechanics]]. Additionally, it complements newer, interdisciplinary fields like [[bioinformatics]] and [[neuroinformatics]] in the sense that its interpretation uses metadata derived from the original sensor imaging modalities (of which [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] is one example). It focuses on the anatomical structures being imaged, rather than the medical imaging devices. It is similar in spirit to the history of [[Computational linguistics]], a discipline that focuses on the linguistic structures rather than the [[sensor]] acting as the [[transmission medium|transmission]] and communication medium(s).

In computational anatomy, the [[diffeomorphism]] group is used to study different coordinate systems via [[change of basis|coordinate transformations]] as generated via the [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Lagrangian and Eulerian velocities of flow]] in &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Computational anatomy#Lagrangian and Eulerian flows for generating diffeomorphisms|flows between coordinates in Computational anatomy]] are constrained to be [[Computational anatomy#The Metric on geodesic flows of landmarks, surfaces, and volumes within the orbit|geodesic flows]] satisfying [[Computational anatomy#The action integral for Hamilton's principle on diffeomorphic flows|the principle of least action for the Kinetic energy of the flow]]. The kinetic energy is defined through a [[Computational anatomy#The Sobolev smoothness condition on vector fields as modeled in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space|Sobolev smoothness]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; norm with strictly more than two generalized, [[square-integrable function|square-integrable]] derivatives for each component of the flow velocity, which guarantees that the flows in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; are diffeomorphisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Variational Problems on Flows of Diffeomorphisms for Image Matching|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2693614|website = ResearchGate|access-date = 2016-02-20|last = Dupuis|first = Paul|authorlink = |last2 = Grenander|first2 = Ulf|authorlink2 = |others = |authorlink3 = |last3 = Miller, Michael|author-first# = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It also implies that the [[Computational anatomy#The Sobolev smoothness condition on vector fields as modeled in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space|diffeomorphic shape momentum]] taken pointwise satisfying the [[Computational anatomy#The Euler–Lagrange equation on shape momentum for geodesics on the group of diffeomorphisms|Euler-Lagrange equation for geodesics]] is determined by its neighbors through spatial derivatives on the velocity field.  This separates the discipline from the case of [[Incompressible flow|incompressible fluids]]&lt;ref name=MR202082&gt;{{Cite journal |mr=202082 |title=Sur la géomérie différentielle des groupes de Lie de dimension infinie et ses applications à l'hydrodynamique des fluides parfaits |journal= Ann.

Computational anatomy intersects the study of [[Riemannian manifolds]] and nonlinear [[global analysis]], where groups of diffeomorphisms are the central focus. Emerging high-dimensional theories of shape&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Laurent Younes |title = Shapes and Diffeomorphisms |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783642120541|date=2010-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are central to many studies in Computational anatomy, as are questions emerging from the fledgling field of [[shape statistics]].
The metric structures in Computational anatomy are related in spirit to [[morphometrics]], with the distinction that Computational anatomy focuses on an infinite-dimensional space of [[coordinate system]]s transformed by a [[diffeomorphism]], hence the central use of the terminology [[#Diffeomorphometry: The Metric Space of Shapes and Forms|'''diffeomorphometry''']], the metric space study of coordinate systems via diffeomorphisms.

==Genesis==
At Computational anatomy's heart is the comparison of shape by recognizing in one shape the other. This connects it to [[D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson]]'s developments [[On Growth and Form]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;which has led to scientific explanations of [[morphogenesis]], the process by which [[patterns]] are formed in [[Biology]]. [[Albrecht Dürer|Albrecht Durer]]'s Four Books on Human Proportion were arguably the earliest works on Computational anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/hierinnsindbegri00dure|title=Hierinn sind begriffen vier Bucher von menschlicher Proportion durch Albrechten Durer von Nurerberg [sic.] erfunden und beschuben zu nutz allen denen so zu diser kunst lieb tragen|last=Durer|first=Albrecht|year=1528|publisher=Hieronymus Andreae Formschneider}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.uthscsa.edu/2012/03/albrecht-durers-human-proportions/|title=Albrecht Dürer's Human Proportions " UT Health Science Center Library|last=Library|first=State of Texas, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio|website=library.uthscsa.edu|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.themorgan.org/collection/printed-books-and-bindings/73192|title=Albrecht Dürer|website=The Morgan Library &amp; Museum|access-date=2016-03-16|date=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efforts of [[Noam Chomsky]] in his pioneering of [[Computational Linguistics]] inspired the original formulation of Computational anatomy as a generative model of shape and form from exemplars acted upon via transformations.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Computational Anatomy: An Emerging Discipline|url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=309082.309089|journal = Q.

Due to the availability of dense 3D measurements via technologies such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), Computational anatomy has emerged as a subfield of [[medical imaging]] and [[bioengineering]] for extracting anatomical coordinate systems at the morphome scale in 3D. The spirit of this discipline shares strong overlap with areas such as [[computer vision]] and [[kinematics]] of [[rigid bodies]], where objects are studied by analysing the [[group (mathematics)|groups]] responsible for the movement in question. Computational anatomy departs from computer vision with its focus on rigid motions, as the infinite-dimensional diffeomorphism group is central to the analysis of Biological shapes. It is a branch of the image analysis and pattern theory school at Brown University&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Brown University -- Pattern Theory Group: Home|url = http://www.dam.brown.edu/ptg/participants.shtml|website = www.dam.brown.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; pioneered by [[Ulf Grenander]]. In Grenander's general Metric [[Pattern Theory]], making spaces of '''patterns''' into a [[Complete metric space|metric space]] is one of the fundamental operations since being able to cluster and recognize anatomical configurations often requires a metric of close and far between shapes. The [[Computational anatomy#The Right Invariant Metric on Diffeomorphism|diffeomorphometry metric]]&lt;ref name="Miller 36"/&gt; of Computational anatomy measures how far two diffeomorphic changes of coordinates are from each other, which in turn induces a [[Computational anatomy#The Metric on Shapes and Forms|metric on the shapes and images]] indexed to them. The models of metric pattern theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = General Pattern Theory : A Mathematical Study of Regular Structures |author=Grenander, Ulf |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780198536710}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Pattern Theory: From Representation to Inference|author = U. Grenander and M. I. Miller  |publisher = Oxford University Press|date = 2007-02-08|location = Oxford|isbn = 9780199297061}}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular group action on the orbit of shapes and forms is a central tool to the formal definitions in Computational anatomy.

==History==
Computational anatomy is the study of shape and form at the [[morphome]] or [[gross anatomy]] millimeter, or [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] scale, focusing on the study of sub-[[manifolds]] of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^3,&lt;/math&gt; points, curves surfaces and subvolumes of human anatomy.
An early modern computational neuro-anatomist was David Van Essen&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Two-dimensional maps of the cerebral cortex |journal = The Journal of Comparative Neurology|date = 1980-05-15 |pmid = 7410593|pages = 255–281|volume = 191|issue = 2|doi = 10.1002/cne.901910208|first = D. C.|last = Van Essen|first2 = J. H.|last2 = Maunsell}}&lt;/ref&gt; performing some of the early physical unfoldings of the human brain based on printing of a human cortex and cutting. [[Jean Talairach|Jean Talairach's]]  publication of [[Talairach coordinates|Tailarach coordinates]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; is an important milestone at the morphome scale demonstrating the fundamental basis of local coordinate systems in studying neuroanatomy and therefore the clear link to [[Differential geometry|charts of differential geometry]]. Concurrently, virtual mapping in Computational anatomy across high resolution dense image coordinates was already happening in [[Ruzena Bajcsy|Ruzena Bajcy's]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Multiresolution Elastic Matching |journal = Comput. Vision Graph. Image Process.|date = 1989-04-01 |pages = 1–21|volume = 46|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/S0734-189X(89)80014-3|first = Ruzena|last = Bajcsy|first2 = Stane|last2 = Kovačič}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fred Bookstein's&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Principal Warps: Thin-Plate Splines and the Decomposition of Deformations |journal = IEEE Trans.

L.|last = Bookstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;  earliest developments based on [[Computed Tomography|Computed axial tomography]] and [[Magnetic resonance imaging|Magnetic resonance imagery]].
The earliest introduction of the use of flows of diffeomorphisms for transformation of coordinate systems in image analysis and medical imaging was by Christensen, Joshi, Miller, and Rabbitt.&lt;ref name="Christensen"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tVVGAQAAIAAJ|title=A deformable neuroanatomy textbook based on viscous fluid mechanics: Proceedings of the ...

The first formalization of Computational Anatomy as an orbit of exemplar templates under [[diffeomorphism]] [[group action]] was in the original lecture given by Grenander and Miller with that title in May 1997 at the 50th Anniversary of the Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown University,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |editor=   Walter Freiberger |title = Current and Future Challenges in the Applications of Mathematics |journal=Quarterly of Applied Mathematics }}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent publication.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; This was the basis for the strong departure from much of the previous work on advanced methods for [[spatial normalization]] and [[image registration]] which were historically built on notions of addition and basis expansion. The structure preserving transformations central to the modern field of Computational Anatomy, [[homeomorphism]]s and [[diffeomorphism]]s carry smooth submanifolds smoothly. They are generated via [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Lagrangian and Eulerian flows]] which &lt;nowiki/&gt;satisfy a law of composition of functions forming the group property, but are not additive.

The original model of Computational anatomy was as the triple, &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{G}, \mathcal{M}, \mathcal{P}) \ ,
&lt;/math&gt; the group  &lt;math&gt; g \in \mathcal{G} &lt;/math&gt;, the orbit of shapes and forms &lt;math&gt; m \in \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt;, and the probability laws &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; which encode the variations of the objects in the orbit. The template or collection of templates are elements in the orbit &lt;math&gt; m_\mathrm{temp} \in \mathcal {M} &lt;/math&gt; of shapes.

The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of the equations of motion of Computational Anatomy took off post 1997 with several pivotal meetings including the 1997 Luminy meeting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Colloque Mathematiques et reconnaissance de formes|url = https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~cohen/MSPCV/luminy.html|website = www.ceremade.dauphine.fr|accessdate = 2015-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized by the Azencott&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Robert Azencott, mathématicien polyglotte {{!}} La Recherche|url = http://www.larecherche.fr/actualite/aussi/robert-azencott-mathematicien-polyglotte-01-12-2000-70634|website = www.larecherche.fr|access-date = 2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; school at [[École Normale Supérieure|Ecole-Normale Cachan]] on the "Mathematics of Shape Recognition" and the 1998 Trimestre at [[Institut Henri Poincaré|Institute Henri Poincar]]é organized by [[David Mumford]] "Questions Mathématiques en Traitement du Signal et de l'Image"  which catalyzed the Hopkins-Brown-ENS Cachan groups and subsequent developments and connections of Computational anatomy to developments in global analysis.

The developments in Computational Anatomy included the establishment of the Sobelev smoothness conditions on the diffeomorphometry metric to insure existence of solutions of [[Calculus of variations|variational]] problems in the space of diffeomorphisms,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/mariom/AM282-01/PAPERS/LANDMARK/an-approach-of-pattern.pdf|title = An Approach of Pattern Recognition through Infinite Dimensional Diffeomorphism|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Trouve|first = Alain}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":142"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Variational Problems on Flows of Diffeomorphisms for Image Matching|url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=298828.298844|journal = Q.

These contributions of Computational anatomy to the global analysis associated to the infinite dimensional manifolds of subgroups of the diffeomorphism group is far from trivial.

==The deformable template orbit model of computational anatomy==
The model of human anatomy is a deformable template, an orbit of exemplars under group action. Deformable template models have been central to Grenander's Metric Pattern theory, accounting for typicality via templates, and accounting for variability via transformation of the template. An orbit under group action as the representation of the deformable template is a classic formulation from differential geometry.  The space of shapes are denoted &lt;math&gt;m \in \mathcal {M}&lt;/math&gt;, with the [[group action|group]] &lt;nowiki/&gt; &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{ G}, \circ )&lt;/math&gt; with law of composition &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt;; the action of the group on shapes is denoted &lt;math&gt;g \cdot m&lt;/math&gt;, where the action of the group &lt;math&gt;g \cdot m \in \mathcal{M}, m \in \mathcal {M}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to satisfy 
:&lt;math&gt; (g \circ g^\prime) \cdot m = g \cdot (g^\prime \cdot m)\in \mathcal { M} .&lt;/math&gt;

The orbit &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt; of the template becomes the space of all shapes, &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M} \doteq \{ m  = g \cdot m_\mathrm{temp}, g \in \mathcal{G} \}&lt;/math&gt;, being homogenous under the action of the elements of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Medial-temporal-lobe-structures.png|alt=FIgure showing different examples of shapes and forms in Computational Anatomy from MR imager.|thumb|Figure depicting three medial temporal lobe structures amgydala, entorhinal cortex and hippocampus with fiducial landmarks depicted as well embedded in the MRI background.]]
The orbit model of computational anatomy is an abstract algebra - to be compared to [[linear algebra]]- since the groups act nonlinearly on the shapes. This is a generalization of the classical models of linear algebra, in which the set of finite dimensional &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^n &lt;/math&gt; vectors are replaced by the finite-dimensional anatomical submanifolds (points, curves, surfaces and volumes) and images of them, and the &lt;math&gt; n \times n &lt;/math&gt; matrices of linear algebra are replaced by coordinate transformations based on linear and affine groups and the more general high-dimensional diffeomorphism groups.

==Shapes and forms==
The central objects are shapes or forms in Computational anatomy, one set of examples being the 0,1,2,3-dimensional submanifolds of &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, a second set of examples being images generated via [[medical imaging]] such as via [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]]. [[File:Subcortical-MRI-caudate-putamen.png|alt=Figure showing triangualted meshes generated from populations of many segmented MRI brains. Each different surface represents a different shape in shape space.|thumb|Triangulated mesh surfaces depicting subcortical structures amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, caudate, putamen, ventricles.The shapes are denoted &lt;math&gt;m(u), u \in U\subset {\mathbb R}^1 \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^2&lt;/math&gt; represented as triangulated meshes.]] The 0-dimensional manifolds are landmarks or fiducial points; 1-dimensional manifolds are curves such as sulcul and gyral curves in the brain; 2-dimensional manifolds correspond to boundaries of substructures in anatomy such as the subcortical structures of the [[midbrain]] or the gyral surface of the [[neocortex]];  subvolumes correspond to subregions of the human body, the [[heart]], the [[thalamus]], the kidney.

The landmarks &lt;math&gt; X \doteq \{ x_1,\dots,x_n \} \subset {\mathbb R}^3 \in \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt; are a collections of points with no other structure, delineating important fiducials within human shape and form (see associated landmarked image).
The sub-[[manifold]] shapes such as surfaces &lt;math&gt; X \subset {\mathbb R}^3 \in \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt; are collections of points modeled as parametrized by a local chart or [[immersion (mathematics)|immersion]] &lt;math&gt; m:U \subset {\mathbb R}^{1,2} \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m(u), u \in U&lt;/math&gt; (see Figure showing shapes as mesh surfaces).
The images such as MR images or DTI images &lt;math&gt;I \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, and are dense functions
&lt;math&gt; I(x), x \in X \subset {\mathbb R}^{1,2,3} &lt;/math&gt; are scalars, vectors, and matrices (see Figure showing scalar image).

==Groups and group actions==
{{Further|Group actions in computational anatomy}}[[File:T1-weighted-MRI.png|alt=Two-dimensional scalar image depicting a section through a 3D brain at the level of the subcortical structures showing white, gray and CSF matter.|thumb|Showing an MRI section through a 3D brain representing a scalar image &lt;math&gt;I(x), x \in {\mathbb R}^2&lt;/math&gt; based on T1-weighting.]][[Group (mathematics)|Group]]s and [[group actions]] are familiar to the Engineering community with the universal popularization and standardization of [[linear algebra]] as a basic model for analyzing [[signals and systems]] in [[mechanical engineering]], [[electrical engineering]] and [[applied mathematics]]. In linear algebra the matrix groups (matrices with inverses) are the central structure, with group action defined by the usual definition of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; as an &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix, acting on &lt;math&gt;x \in {\mathbb R}^n&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n \times 1&lt;/math&gt;  vectors; the orbit in linear-algebra is the set of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-vectors given by &lt;math&gt;y = A \cdot x \in {\mathbb R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, which is a group action of the matrices through the orbit of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^n&lt;/math&gt;.

The central group in Computational anatomy defined on volumes in  &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt; are the [[diffeomorphisms]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G} \doteq Diff&lt;/math&gt; which are mappings with 3-components &lt;math&gt;\phi(\cdot) = (\phi_1(\cdot),\phi_2 (\cdot),\phi_3 (\cdot))&lt;/math&gt;, law of composition of functions &lt;math&gt; \phi \circ \phi^\prime (\cdot)\doteq \phi (\phi^\prime(\cdot)) &lt;/math&gt;, with inverse &lt;math&gt; \phi \circ \phi^{-1}(\cdot) =\phi ( \phi^{-1}(\cdot))= id&lt;/math&gt;.

Most popular are scalar images, &lt;math&gt;I(x),x \in {\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt;, with action on the right via the inverse.

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi \cdot I(x) = I \circ \phi^{-1} (x), x \in {\mathbb R}^3
&lt;/math&gt;.

For sub-[[manifold]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s &lt;math&gt; X \subset {\mathbb R}^3 \in \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt;, parametrized by a chart or [[immersion (mathematics)|immersion]] &lt;math&gt; m(u), u \in U &lt;/math&gt;, the diffeomorphic action the flow of the position

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi \cdot m(u) \doteq \phi\circ m(u), u \in U
&lt;/math&gt;.

Several [[group actions in computational anatomy]] have been defined.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Lagrangian and Eulerian flows for generating diffeomorphisms==
For the study of [[rigid body]] [[kinematics]], the low-dimensional matrix [[Lie groups]] have been the central focus. The matrix groups are low-dimensional mappings, which are diffeomorphisms that provide one-to-one correspondences between coordinate systems, with a smooth inverse. The [[matrix group]] of rotations and scales can be generated via a closed form finite-dimensional matrices which are solution of simple ordinary differential equations with solutions given by the matrix exponential.

For the study of deformable shape in Computational anatomy, a more general diffeomorphism group has been the group of choice, which is the infinite dimensional analogue. The high-dimensional differeomorphism groups used in Computational Anatomy are generated via smooth flows  &lt;math&gt; \phi_t,  t \in [0,1] &lt;/math&gt; which satisfy the [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field]]s&lt;nowiki/&gt; as first introduced in.,&lt;ref name="Christensen"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Christensen 1435–14472"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christensen|first=G.

==The diffeomorphism group of computational anatomy==
The group of diffeomorphisms is very big. To ensure smooth flows of diffeomorphisms avoiding [[Advection#Solving the equation|shock-like solutions]] for the inverse,  the vector fields must be at least 1-time continuously differentiable in space.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;P. Dupuis, U. Grenander, M.I. Miller, Existence of Solutions on Flows of Diffeomorphisms, Quarterly of Applied Math, 1997.

1034, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; For diffeomorphisms on &lt;math&gt;  {\mathbb R}^3   &lt;/math&gt;, vector fields are modelled as elements of the Hilbert space  &lt;math&gt;(V, \| \cdot \|_V )&lt;/math&gt; using the [[Sobolev space|Sobolev]] embedding theorems so that each element  has strictly greater than 2 generalized square-integrable spatial derivatives (thus &lt;math&gt;v_i \in H_0^3, i=1,2,3,&lt;/math&gt; is sufficient), yielding 1-time continuously differentiable functions.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

The diffeomorphism group are flows with vector fields absolutely integrable in Sobolev norm:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
Diff_V \doteq \{\varphi=\phi_1: \dot \phi_t = v_t \circ \phi_t , \phi_0 = id, \int_0^1 \|v_t \|_V dt &lt; \infty \} \ ,

where
&lt;math&gt;  \| v\|_V^2 \doteq \int_X Av\cdot v dx, \ v \in V \ ,
&lt;/math&gt; 
with the linear operator &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; mapping to the dual space &lt;math&gt;A: V \mapsto V^*&lt;/math&gt;, with the integral calculated by integration by parts when &lt;math&gt;Av \in V^*&lt;/math&gt; is a generalized function  in the dual space.

{{Hide | Sobolev smoothness and Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space with Green's kernel |

===The Sobolev smoothness condition on vector fields as modeled in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space===

The modelling approach used in Computational anatomy enforces a continuous differentiability condition on the vector fields by modelling the space of vector fields &lt;math&gt;(V, \| \cdot \|_V )&lt;/math&gt; as a [[reproducing kernel Hilbert space]] (RKHS), with the norm defined by a 1-1, differential operator&lt;math&gt; A: V \rightarrow V^*  &lt;/math&gt;, Green's inverse &lt;math&gt;K = A^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.  The norm of the Hilbert space is induced by the differential operator.  For &lt;math&gt; \sigma(v) \doteq Av \in V^*
&lt;/math&gt; a generalized function or distribution, define the linear form as &lt;math&gt; (\sigma|w)\doteq \int_{{\mathbb R}^3}  \sum_i w_i(x) \sigma_i(dx)
&lt;/math&gt;. This determines the norm on &lt;math&gt;(V, \| \cdot \|_V )&lt;/math&gt; according to
:&lt;math&gt; \langle v , w \rangle_V \doteq \int_X A v \cdot w dx, \ \| v\|_V^2 \doteq \int_X Av \cdot v dx, \ v,w \in V \ .
&lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is a differential operator, finiteness of the norm-square &lt;math&gt;  (Av|v) &lt; \infty
&lt;/math&gt; includes derivatives from the differential operator implying smoothness of the vector fields.The [[Sobolev embedding]] theorem arguments were made in&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; demonstrating that 1-continuous derivative is required for smooth flows.
For proper choice of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; (V,\| \cdot \|_V) &lt;/math&gt; is an RKHS with the operator &lt;math&gt; K = A^{-1}: V^* \rightarrow V &lt;/math&gt;  termed the [[Green's function for the three-variable Laplace equation|Green's]] operator generated from the [[Green's function]] (scalar case) for the vector field case. The Green's kernels associated to the differential operator smooths since the kernel  &lt;math&gt; k(\cdot,\cdot)
&lt;/math&gt; is continuously differentiable in both variables implying

:&lt;math&gt; K\sigma (x)_i \doteq \sum_j \int_{{\mathbb R}^3}  k_{ij}(x,y) \sigma_j(dy)
&lt;/math&gt;

Oftentimes, the familiar Euclidean metric is not directly applicable because the patterns of shapes and images don't form a vector space. In the [[Riemannian Metric and Lie-Bracket Interpretation of the Euler Equation on Geodesics|Riemannian orbit model of Computational anatomy]], diffeomorphisms acting on the forms &lt;math&gt;\phi \cdot m \in \mathcal {M}, \phi \in Diff_V, m \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; don't act linearly. There are many ways to define metrics, and for the sets associated to shapes the [[Hausdorff metric]] is another. The method we use to induce the [[Riemannian metric]] is&lt;nowiki/&gt; used to induce the metric on the orbit of shapes by defining it in terms of the metric length between diffeomorphic coordinate system transformations of the flows. Measuring the lengths of the geodesic flow between coordinates systems in the orbit of shapes is called '''diffeomorphometry'''.

===The right-invariant metric on diffeomorphisms===
Define the distance on the group of diffeomorphisms   {{NumBlk||&lt;math&gt;
d_{Diff_V}(\psi, \varphi) = \inf_{v_t} \left(\int_0^1 \int_X Av_t \cdot v_t dx \ dt: \phi_0 = \psi, \phi_1 = \varphi, \dot \phi_t = v_t \circ \phi_t \right)^{1/2} \ ;

==The action integral for Hamilton's principle on diffeomorphic flows==

In classical mechanics the evolution of physical systems is described by solutions to the Euler–Lagrange equations associated to the [[Least-action principle]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; of [[Hamilton's principle|Hamilton]]. This is a standard way, for example of obtaining [[Newton's laws of motion]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; of free particles. More generally, the Euler-Lagrange equations can be derived for systems of [[generalized coordinates]]. The Euler-Lagrange equation in Computational anatomy describes the geodesic shortest path flows between coordinate systems of the diffeomorphism metric. In Computational anatomy the generalized coordinates are the flow of the diffeomorphism and its Lagrangian velocity &lt;math&gt;\phi, \dot{\phi}&lt;/math&gt;, the two related via the Eulerian velocity &lt;math&gt;v \doteq \dot{\phi} \circ \phi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. 
[[Hamilton principle|Hamilton's principle]] for generating the Euler-Lagrange equation requires the action integral on the Lagrangian given by 
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;J(\phi) \doteq \int_0^1 L(\phi_t,\dot \phi_t) dt \ ;&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Hamiltonian-Integrated-Lagrangian}}}}
the Lagrangian is given by the kinetic energy:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; 
 L(\phi_t, \dot \phi_t ) \doteq \frac{1}{2} \int_X A (\dot \phi_t \circ \phi_t^{-1}) \cdot (\dot \phi_t \circ \phi_t^{-1} ) dx
= \frac{1}{2} \int_X Av_t \cdot v_t \ dx \ .
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Lagrangian-Kinetic-Energy}}}}

==Diffeomorphic or Eulerian shape momentum==
In computational anatomy, &lt;math&gt;Av&lt;/math&gt; was first called the '''Eulerian or diffeomorphic shape momentum'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MILLER|first=MICHAEL I.|last2=TROUVÉ|first2=ALAIN|last3=YOUNES|first3=LAURENT|date=2006-01-31|title=Geodesic Shooting for Computational Anatomy |journal=Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision|volume=24|issue=2|pages=209–228|doi=10.1007/s10851-005-3624-0 |pmc=2897162|pmid=20613972}}&lt;/ref&gt;  since when integrated against Eulerian velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; gives energy density, and since there is a [[Computational anatomy#Conservation laws on diffeomorphic shape momentum for computational anatomy|conservation of diffeomorphic shape momentum]] which holds. The operator &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the generalized [[moment of inertia]] or inertial operator.

==The Euler–Lagrange equation on shape momentum for geodesics on the group of diffeomorphisms==
{{Further|Riemannian metric and Lie-bracket in computational anatomy}}

Classical calculation of the Euler-Lagrange equation from [[Hamilton principle|Hamilton's principle]] requires the perturbation of the Lagrangian on the vector field in the kinetic energy with respect to first order perturbation of the flow. This requires adjustment by the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket of vector field]], given by operator &lt;math&gt; ad_v: w \in V \mapsto V &lt;/math&gt;  which involves the Jacobian given by 
:&lt;math&gt; ad_v[w]\doteq [v,w]\doteq (Dv)w-(Dw)v \in V &lt;/math&gt;.
:
Defining the adjoint &lt;math&gt; ad_v^*: V^* \rightarrow V^*,  &lt;/math&gt; then the first order variation gives the Eulerian shape momentum &lt;math&gt;Av \in V^*&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the generalized equation:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dt} Av_t + ad_{v_t}^* (Av_t)=0  \ , \ t \in [0,1] \  ;
&lt;/math&gt; |{{EquationRef|EL-General}}}}

meaning for all smooth &lt;math&gt; w \in V ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \int_X \left( \frac{d}{dt} Av_t + ad_{v_t}^* (Av_t) \right) \cdot w dx =  \int_X \frac{d}{dt} Av_t \cdot  w dx + \int_X Av_t \cdot ((Dv_t)w-(Dw)v_t) dx =0 . &lt;/math&gt;

Computational anatomy is the study of the motions of submanifolds, points, curves, surfaces and volumes.
Momentum associated to points, curves and surfaces are all singular, implying the momentum is concentrated on subsets of &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt; which are dimension &lt;math&gt; \leq 2 &lt;/math&gt; in [[Lebesgue measure]]. In such cases, the energy is still well defined &lt;math&gt; (Av_t\mid v_t) &lt;/math&gt; since although &lt;math&gt; Av_t &lt;/math&gt; is a generalized function, the vector fields are smooth and the Eulerian momentum is understood via its action on smooth functions. The perfect illustration of this is even when it is a superposition of delta-diracs, the velocity of the coordinates in the entire volume move smoothly.The Euler-Lagrange equation ({{EquationNote|EL-General}}) on diffeomorphisms for generalized functions &lt;math&gt; Av \in V^* &lt;/math&gt; was derived in.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;M.I. Miller, A. Trouve, L. Younes, Geodesic Shooting in Computational Anatomy, IJCV, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Riemannian Metric and Lie-Bracket Interpretation of the Euler Equation on Geodesics|Riemannian Metric and Lie-Bracket Interpretation of the Euler-Lagrange Equation on Geodesics]] derivations are provided in terms of the adjoint operator and the Lie bracket for the group of diffeomorphisms. It has come to be called EPDiff equation for diffeomorphisms connecting to the Euler-Poincare method having been studied in the context of the inertial operator &lt;math&gt;A=identity&lt;/math&gt;  for incompressible, divergence free, fluids.&lt;ref name="Mumford" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holm | first1 = DD | last2 = Marsden | first2 = JE | last3 = Ratiu | first3 = TS | year = 1998 | title = The Euler-Poincaré equations and semidirect products with applications to continuum theories | url = | journal = Adv.

==Riemannian exponential (geodesic positioning) and Riemannian logarithm (geodesic coordinates)==
{{Further|Riemannian metric and Lie-bracket in computational anatomy}}
In Medical imaging and Computational anatomy, positioning and coordinatizing shapes are fundamental operations; the system for positioning anatomical coordinates and shapes built on the metric and the Euler-Lagrange equation a geodesic positioning system as first explicated in Miller Trouve and Younes.&lt;ref name="Miller 36"/&gt;
Solving the geodesic from the initial condition &lt;math&gt; v_0 &lt;/math&gt; is termed the '''Riemannian-exponential,''' a mapping &lt;math&gt; Exp_{\rm id}(\cdot): V \to Diff_V
&lt;/math&gt; at identity to the group.

The Riemannian exponential satisfies &lt;math&gt;
Exp_{id} (v_0)= \phi_1 &lt;/math&gt; for initial condition &lt;math&gt;\dot \phi_0 = v_0&lt;/math&gt;, vector field dynamics &lt;math&gt;\dot \phi_t = v_t \circ \phi_t, t \in [0,1]  
&lt;/math&gt;,

  Log_{ id}( \varphi) = v_0 \ \text{initial condition of EL geodesic } \dot \phi_0 = v_0, \phi_0=id,  \phi_1=\varphi \ .

Extended to the entire group they become

&lt;math&gt;
\phi= Exp_\varphi(v_0\circ \varphi) \doteq Exp_{id} (v_0) \circ \varphi

These are inverses of each other for unique solutions of Logarithm; the first is called '''geodesic positioning,''' the latter '''geodesic coordinates''' (see [[Exponential map (Riemannian geometry)|Exponential map, Riemannian geometry]] for the finite dimensional version).'''The geodesic metric''' is a local flattening of the Riemannian coordinate system (see figure). 
[[File:FigBrain.png|thumb|Showing metric local flattening of coordinatized manifolds of shapes and forms. The local metric is given by the norm of the vector field &lt;math&gt;\|v_0\|_V&lt;/math&gt; of the geodesic mapping &lt;math&gt;Exp_{id}(v_0) \cdot m&lt;/math&gt;]]

==Hamiltonian formulation of computational anatomy==

In Computational anatomy the diffeomorphisms are used to push the coordinate systems, and the vector fields are used
as the control within the
anatomical orbit or morphological space. The model is that of a dynamical system, the flow of coordinates &lt;math&gt; t \mapsto \phi_t \in \operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt; and the control the vector field &lt;math&gt; t \mapsto v_t \in V&lt;/math&gt; related via &lt;math&gt; \dot \phi_t = v_t \cdot \phi_t,\phi_0=id . &lt;/math&gt;  The Hamiltonian view

This function is the extended Hamiltonian. The [[Pontryagin maximum principle]]&lt;ref name="Miller null2"/&gt; gives the optimizing vector field which determines the geodesic flow satisfying &lt;math&gt;\dot \phi_t = v_t \circ \phi_t , \phi_0=id,&lt;/math&gt; as well as the reduced Hamiltonian 
:&lt;math&gt; H(\phi_t,p_t) \doteq \max_v H( \phi_t, p_t,v) \ . &lt;/math&gt;
The Lagrange multiplier in its action as a linear form has its own inner product of the canonical momentum acting on the velocity of the flow which is dependent on the shape, e.g. for landmarks a sum, for surfaces a surface integral, and. for volumes it is a volume integral with respect to &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt; on  &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt;. In all cases the Greens kernels carry weights which are the canonical momentum evolving according to an ordinary differential equation which corresponds to EL but is the geodesic reparameterization in canonical momentum. The optimizing vector field is given by

For surfaces, the momentum is a [[Computational anatomy#Surface geodesics|surface integral of delta distributions]] travelling with the surface.&lt;ref name="Miller 36" /&gt;

The geodesics connecting coordinate systems satisfying {{EquationNote|EL-General}} have stationarity of the Lagrangian. The Hamiltonian is given by the extremum along the path &lt;math&gt;t \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H(\phi,p) = \max_v H(\phi,p,v)
&lt;/math&gt;, equalling the {{EquationNote|Lagrangian-Kinetic-Energy}}  and is stationary along {{EquationNote|EL-General}}. Defining the geodesic velocity at the identity &lt;math&gt;v_0 = \arg \max_v H(\phi_0,p_0,v)
&lt;/math&gt;, then along the geodesic

 &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Hamiltonian-Geodesics}}}}The stationarity of the Hamiltonian demonstrates the interpretation of the Lagrange multiplier as momentum; integrated against velocity &lt;math&gt;\dot \phi&lt;/math&gt; gives energy density.

==The metric on geodesic flows of landmarks, surfaces, and volumes within the orbit==
In Computational anatomy the submanifolds are pointsets, curves, surfaces and subvolumes which are the basic primitives. The geodesic flows between the submanifolds determine the distance, and form the basic measuring and transporting tools of [[diffeomorphometry]]. At  &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; the geodesic has vector field &lt;math&gt;v_0 = K p_0&lt;/math&gt; determined by the conjugate momentum and the Green's kernel of the inertial operator defining the Eulerian momentum &lt;math&gt;K=A^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. The metric distance between coordinate systems connected via the geodesic determined by the induced distance between identity and group element:
:&lt;math&gt;d_{Diff_V}(id,\varphi) = \|Log_{id}(\varphi)\|_V=\| v_0 \|_V = \sqrt{2H(id,p_0)}&lt;/math&gt;

==[[Conservation law (physics)|Conservation law]]s on diffeomorphic shape momentum for computational anatomy==
Given the least-action there is a natural definition of momentum associated to generalized coordinates; the quantity acting against velocity gives energy. The field has studied two forms, the momentum associated to the Eulerian vector field termed '''Eulerian diffeomorphic shape momentum''', and the momentum associated to the initial coordinates or canonical coordinates termed '''canonical diffeomorphic shape momentum'''. Each has a conservation law.The conservation of momentum goes hand in hand with the {{EquationNote|EL-General}}. In Computational anatomy, &lt;math&gt;Av&lt;/math&gt; is the Eulerian [[Momentum]] since when integrated against Eulerian velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; gives energy density; operator &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; the generalized [[moment of inertia]] or inertial operator which acting on the Eulerian velocity gives momentum which is conserved along the geodesic: {{NumBlk|:|

The running cost is reduced to the initial cost determined by &lt;math&gt;v_0=Kp_0&lt;/math&gt; of  {{EquationNote|Kernel-Surf.-Land.-Geodesics}}.

{{Further| Group actions in computational anatomy | LDDMM#LDDMM ODF}}

High angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) addresses the well-known limitation of DTI, that is, DTI can only reveal one dominant fiber orientation at each location. HARDI measures diffusion along &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; uniformly distributed directions on the sphere and can characterize more complex fiber geometries. HARDI can be used to reconstruct an [[orientation distribution function]] (ODF) that characterizes the angular profile of the diffusion probability density function of water molecules. The ODF is a function defined on a unit sphere, &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb{S}}^2 &lt;/math&gt;.

Dense LDDMM ODF matching &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Du|first1=J|last2=Goh|first2=A|last3=Qiu|first3=A|title=Diffeomorphic metric mapping of high angular resolution diffusion imaging based on Riemannian structure of orientation distribution functions|journal=IEEE Trans Med Imaging|date=2012|volume=31|issue=5|pages=1021–1033|doi=10.1109/TMI.2011.2178253|pmid=22156979}}&lt;/ref&gt; takes the HARDI data as ODF at each voxel and solves the LDDMM variational problem in the space of ODF. In the field of [[information geometry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Amari|first1=S|title=Differential-Geometrical Methods in Statistics|date=1985|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; the space of ODF forms a Riemannian manifold with the Fisher-Rao metric. For the purpose of LDDMM ODF mapping, the square-root representation is chosen because it is one of the most efficient representations found to date as the various Riemannian operations, such as geodesics, exponential maps, and logarithm maps, are available in closed form. In the following, denote square-root ODF (&lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{\text{ODF}}} &lt;/math&gt;) as &lt;math&gt; \psi({\bf s}) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \psi({\bf s}) &lt;/math&gt; is non-negative to ensure uniqueness and &lt;math&gt; \int_{{\bf s}\in  {\mathbb{S}}^2} \psi^2({\bf s}) d{\bf s}=1&lt;/math&gt;. The variational problem for matching assumes that two ODF volumes can be generated from one to another via flows of diffeomorphisms &lt;math&gt; \phi_t &lt;/math&gt;, which are solutions of ordinary differential equations 
&lt;math&gt; \dot \phi_t = v_t (\phi_t), t \in [0,1], &lt;/math&gt; starting from
the identity map &lt;math&gt;\phi_0={id} &lt;/math&gt;. Denote the action of the diffeomorphism on template  as &lt;math&gt;\phi_1 \cdot \psi_{\mathrm{temp}}({\bf s},x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; {\bf s} \in {{\mathbb{S}}^2} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; x \in X &lt;/math&gt; are respectively the coordinates of the unit sphere, &lt;math&gt; {{\mathbb{S}}^2} &lt;/math&gt; and the image domain, with the target indexed similarly, &lt;math&gt;\psi_{\mathrm{targ}}({\bf s}, x)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt; {\bf s} \in {{\mathbb{S}}^2} &lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt; x \in X &lt;/math&gt;.

The group action of the diffeomorphism on the template is given according to
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_1 \cdot \psi (x)\doteq  (D\phi_1) \psi \circ \phi_1^{-1}(x), x \in X &lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt; (D\phi_1) &lt;/math&gt; is the Jacobian of the affined transformed ODF and is defined as
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(D \phi_1) \psi\circ \phi_1^{-1}(x) =   \sqrt{\frac{\det{\bigl(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1}} }{\left\|{\bigl(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1} } {\bf s} \right\|^3} } \quad
\psi \left( \frac{(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1} {\bf s}}{\|(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1} {\bf s}\|}, \phi_1^{-1}(x) \right) .
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
:
This group action of diffeomorphisms on ODF reorients the ODF and reflects changes in both the magnitude of &lt;math&gt; \psi &lt;/math&gt; and the sampling directions of &lt;math&gt; \bf s &lt;/math&gt; due to affine transformation. It guarantees that the volume fraction of fibers oriented toward a small patch must remain the same after the patch is transformed. 
:
The LDDMM variational problem is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
C(v) = \inf_{v: \dot \phi_t =
v_t \circ \phi_t,\phi_0={
id}}\int_0^1 \int_X Av_t \cdot v_t dx \ dt 
 +\lambda \int_{x\in\Omega}\|\log_{(D\phi_1) \psi_{\mathrm{temp}} \circ \phi_1^{-1}(x)}(\psi_{\mathrm{targ}}(x))\|^2_{(D\phi_1) \psi_{\mathrm{temp}}\circ \phi_1^{-1}(x)}dx 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;.

where the logarithm of &lt;math&gt; \psi_1, \psi_2 \in \Psi &lt;/math&gt; is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\|\log_{\psi_1}(\psi_2)\|_{\psi_1} 
=\cos^{-1} \langle \psi_1, \psi_2 \rangle = 
\cos^{-1}\left(\int_{{\bf s}\in {\mathbb{S}}^2} \psi_1({\bf s}) \psi_2({\bf s})d{\bf s}\right),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is the normal dot product between points in the sphere under the &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{L}^2 &lt;/math&gt; metric.

The principle mode of variation represented by the orbit model is change of coordinates. For setting in which pairs of images are not related by diffeomorphisms but have photometric variation or image variation not represented by the template, [[active appearance model]]ling has been introduced, originally by Edwards-Cootes-Taylor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Active appearance models |publisher = Springer Berlin Heidelberg|date = 1998-06-02|isbn = 9783540646136|pages = 484–498|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science |first = T.

In the context of Computational Anatomy in which metrics on the anatomical orbit has been studied, '''metamorphosis''' for modelling structures such as tumors and photometric changes which are not resident in the template was introduced in&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt; for Magnetic Resonance image models, with many subsequent developments extending the metamorphosis framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Metamorphoses Through Lie Group Action|date = 2005-01-01|first = Alain|last = Trouvé|first2 = Laurent|last2 = Younes|citeseerx = 10.1.1.157.8752}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv|title = The Euler-Poincare theory of Metamorphosis |eprint=0806.0870 |date = 2008-06-04|first = Darryl D.|last = Holm|first2 = Alain|last2 = Trouve|first3 = Laurent|last3 = Younes|class=cs.CV }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv|title = Metamorphosis of Images in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces|eprint=1409.6573|date = 2014-09-23|first = Casey L.|last = Richardson|first2 = Laurent|last2 = Younes|class=math.OC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For image matching the image metamorphosis framework enlarges the action so that &lt;math&gt; t \mapsto (\phi_t,I_t) &lt;/math&gt; with action &lt;math&gt; \phi_t \cdot I_t \doteq I_t \circ \phi_t^{-1}  &lt;/math&gt;. In this setting metamorphosis combines both the diffeomorphic coordinate system transformation of Computational Anatomy as well as the early [[morphing]] technologies which only faded or modified the photometric or image intensity alone.

Then the matching problem takes a form with equality boundary conditions:
:&lt;math&gt;
\min_{(v,I)}
\frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 \left( \int_X A v_t \cdot v_t dx +
\| \dot I_t \circ \phi_t^{-1} \|^2 / \sigma^2 \right) \, dt  \text{ subject to} \ \phi_0=id, I_0=\text{fixed}, I_1=\text{fixed}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Matching landmarks, curves, surfaces==
Transforming coordinate systems based on [[Landmark point]] or [[fiducial marker]] features dates back to Bookstein's early work on small deformation spline methods&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Principal Warps: Thin-Plate Splines and the Decomposition of Deformations|url = http://www.computer.org/csdl/trans/tp/1989/06/i0567.pdf|journal = IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence|date = 1989-01-01 |pages = 567–585|volume = 11|issue = 6|doi = 10.1109/34.24792|first = F. L.|last = Bookstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; for interpolating correspondences defined by fiducial points to the two-dimensional or three-dimensional background space in which the fiducials are defined. Large deformation landmark methods came on in the late 90's.&lt;ref name="Miller 209–228"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Joshi 1357–1370"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Geodesic Interpolating Splines|url = |doi=10.1007/3-540-44745-8_34|publisher = Springer Berlin Heidelberg|date = 2001-09-03|isbn = 9783540425236|pages = 513–527|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|first = Vincent|last = Camion|first2 = Laurent|last2 = Younes|editor-first = Mário|editor-last = Figueiredo|editor-first2 = Josiane|editor-last2 = Zerubia|editor-first3 = Anil K.|editor-last3 = Jain|citeseerx = 10.1.1.57.7394}}&lt;/ref&gt; The above Figure depicts a series of landmarks associated three brain structures, the amygdala, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus.

Matching geometrical objects like unlabelled point distributions, curves or surfaces is another common problem in Computational Anatomy. Even in the discrete setting where these are commonly given as vertices with meshes, there are no predetermined correspondences between points as opposed to the situation of landmarks described above. From the theoretical point of view, while any submanifold &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; d=1,2,3 &lt;/math&gt; can be parameterized in local charts &lt;math&gt; m: u \in U \subset {\mathbb R}^{0,1,2,3} \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, all reparametrizations of these charts give geometrically the same manifold. Therefore, early on in Computational anatomy, investigators have identified the necessity of parametrization invariant representations. One indispensable requirement is that the end-point matching term between two submanifolds is itself independent of their parametrizations. This can be achieved via concepts and methods borrowed from [[Geometric measure theory]], in particular [[Current (mathematics)|currents]]&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Surface matching via currents |journal = Information Processing in Medical Imaging: Proceedings of the ...

===Measure matching: unregistered landmarks===
Glaunes and co-workers first introduced diffeomorphic matching of pointsets in the general setting of matching distributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Glaunes|first=J.|last2=Trouve|first2=A.|last3=Younes|first3=L.|date=2004-06-01|title=Diffeomorphic matching of distributions: a new approach for unlabelled point-sets and sub-manifolds matching|journal=Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2004.

The template and target discrete point clouds are represented as two weighted sums of Diracs &lt;math&gt; \mu_{m} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \rho_i \delta_{x_i} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mu_{m^\prime} = \sum_{i=1}^{n^\prime} \rho^{\prime}_{i} \delta_{x^{\prime}_{i}} &lt;/math&gt; living in the space of [[signed measure]]s of &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;. The space is equipped with a Hilbert metric obtained from a real positive kernel &lt;math&gt; k(x,y) &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, giving the following norm:

: &lt;math&gt;
\| \mu_{m} \|_\mathrm{mea}^2 = \sum_{i,j=1}^{n} \rho_i \rho_j k(x_i,x_j)
&lt;/math&gt;

The matching problem between a template and target point cloud may be then formulated using this kernel metric for the endpoint matching term:

: &lt;math&gt;
\min_{\phi: v=\dot \phi \circ \phi^{-1}} C(\phi) \doteq \frac{1}{2} \int
     (Av_t\mid v_t) \, dt  +\frac{1}{2} \| \mu_{\phi_1 \cdot m} - \mu_{m^\prime} \|_\mathrm{mea}^2
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mu_{\phi_1 \cdot m} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \rho_i \delta_{\phi_1(x_i)} &lt;/math&gt; is the distribution transported by the deformation.

===Curve matching===
In the one dimensional case, a curve in 3D can be represented by an embedding &lt;math&gt; m: u \in [0,1] \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, and the group action of ''Diff'' becomes &lt;math&gt; \phi \cdot m = \phi \circ m&lt;/math&gt;. However, the correspondence between curves and embeddings is not one to one as the any reparametrization &lt;math&gt;m \circ \gamma&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; a diffeomorphism of the interval [0,1], represents geometrically the same curve. In order to preserve this invariance in the end-point matching term, several extensions of the previous 0-dimensional measure matching approach can be considered.

* '''Curve matching with currents'''
In the situation of oriented curves, currents give an efficient setting to construct invariant matching terms. In such representation, curves are interpreted as elements of a functional space dual to the space vector fields, and compared through kernel norms on these spaces. Matching of two curves &lt;math&gt; m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; m^\prime&lt;/math&gt; writes eventually as the variational problem

: &lt;math&gt;
\min_{\phi: v=\dot \phi \circ \phi^{-1}} C(\phi) \doteq \frac{1}{2} \int
     (Av_t\mid v_t) \, dt  +\frac{1}{2} \| \mathcal{C}_{\phi_1 \cdot m} - \mathcal{C}_{m^\prime} \|_\mathrm{cur}^2
&lt;/math&gt;

with the endpoint term &lt;math&gt; E(\phi_1) = \| \mathcal{C}_{\phi_1 \cdot m} - \mathcal{C}_{m^\prime} \|_\mathrm{cur}^2/2 &lt;/math&gt; is obtained from the norm

: &lt;math&gt;
\| \mathcal{C}_{m} \|_\mathrm{cur}^2 = \int_0^1 \int_0^1 K_C(m(u),m(v)) \partial m(u) \cdot \partial m(v) \, du \, dv
&lt;/math&gt;

the derivative &lt;math&gt; \partial m(u)&lt;/math&gt; being the tangent vector to the curve and &lt;math&gt; K_{\mathcal{C}} &lt;/math&gt; a given matrix kernel of &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;. Such expressions are invariant to any positive reparametrizations of &lt;math&gt; m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; m'&lt;/math&gt;, and thus still depend on the orientation of the two curves.

* '''Curve matching with varifolds'''
Varifold is an alternative to currents when orientation becomes an issue as for instance in situations involving multiple bundles of curves for which no "consistent" orientation may be defined. Varifolds directly extend 0-dimensional measures by adding an extra tangent space direction to the position of points, leading to represent curves as measures on the product of &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt; and the [[Grassmannian]] of all straight lines in &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;. The matching problem between two curves then consists in replacing the endpoint matching term by &lt;math&gt; E(\phi_1) = \| \mathcal{V}_{\phi_1 \cdot m} - \mathcal{V}_{m^\prime} \|_{cur}^2/2 &lt;/math&gt; with varifold norms of the form:

: &lt;math&gt;
\| \mathcal{V}_m \|_{var}^2 = \int_{0}^1 \int_{0}^1 k_{\mathbb{R}^3}(m(u),m(v)) k_{\mathbf{Gr}}\left([\partial m(u)],[\partial m(v)] \right) {{|}}\partial m(u){{|}} {{|}}\partial m(v) {{|}} \, du \, dv 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; [\partial m(u)]&lt;/math&gt; is the non-oriented line directed by tangent vector &lt;math&gt; \partial m(u)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_{\mathbb{R}^3}, k_{\mathbf{Gr}}&lt;/math&gt; two scalar kernels respectively on  &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; and the Grassmannian. Due to the inherent non-oriented nature of the Grassmannian representation, such expressions are invariant to positive and negative reparametrizations.

===Surface matching===
Surface matching share many similarities with the case of curves. Surfaces in &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt; are parametrized in local charts by embeddings &lt;math&gt; m: u \in U \subset {\mathbb R}^{2} \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, with all reparametrizations &lt;math&gt; m\circ \gamma &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; a diffeomorphism of U being equivalent geometrically. Currents and varifolds can be also used to formalize surface matching.

* '''Surface matching with currents'''
Oriented surfaces can be represented as 2-currents which are dual to differential 2-forms. In &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;, one can further identify 2-forms with vector fields through the standard wedge product of 3D vectors. In that setting, surface matching writes again:

: &lt;math&gt;
\min_{\phi: v=\dot \phi \circ \phi^{-1}} C(\phi) \doteq \frac{1}{2} \int
     (Av_t\mid v_t) \, dt  +\frac{1}{2} \| \mathcal{C}_{\phi_1 \cdot m} - \mathcal{C}_{m^\prime} \|_\mathrm{cur}^2
&lt;/math&gt;

with the endpoint term &lt;math&gt; E(\phi_1) = \| \mathcal{C}_{\phi_1 \cdot m} - \mathcal{C}_{m^\prime} \|_\mathrm{cur}^2/2 &lt;/math&gt; given through the norm

: &lt;math&gt;
\| \mathcal{C}_{m} \|_\mathrm{cur}^2 = \iint_{U\times U} K_C(m(u),m(v)) \vec{n}(u) \cdot \vec{n}(v) \, du \, dv
&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt; \vec{n} = \partial_{u_1} m \wedge \partial_{u_2} m &lt;/math&gt; the normal vector to the surface parametrized by &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt;.

This surface mapping algorithm has been validated for brain cortical surfaces against CARET and FreeSurfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhong|first1=J|last2=Phua|first2=DY|last3=Qiu|first3=A|title=Quantitative evaluation of LDDMM, FreeSurfer, and CARET for cortical surface mapping|journal=NeuroImage|date=2010|volume=52|issue=1|pages=131–141|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.03.085|pmid=20381626}}&lt;/ref&gt; LDDMM mapping for multiscale surfaces is discussed in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=M|last2=Qiu|first2=A|title=Large Deformation Multiresolution Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping for Multiresolution Cortical Surfaces: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach|journal=IEEE Trans Image Process.|date=2016|volume=25|issue=9|pages=4061–4074|doi=10.1109/TIP.2016.2574982|pmid=27254865|bibcode=2016ITIP...25.4061T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Surface matching with varifolds'''
For non-orientable or non-oriented surfaces, the varifold framework is often more adequate.

: &lt;math&gt;
\| \mathcal{V}_{m} \|_\mathrm{var}^2 = \iint_{U\times U} k_{\mathbb{R}^3}(m(u),m(v)) k_{\mathbf{Gr}}\left([\vec{n}(u)],[\vec{n}(v)] \right) {{|}}\vec{n}(u){{|}} {{|}}\vec{n}(v) {{|}} \, du \, dv

where &lt;math&gt; [\vec{n}(u)] &lt;/math&gt; is the (non-oriented) line directed by the normal vector to the surface.

==Growth and atrophy from longitudinal time-series==

There are many settings in which there are a series of measurements, a time-series to which the underlying
coordinate systems will be matched and flowed onto. This occurs for example
in the dynamic growth and atrophy models and motion tracking such as have been explored in&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Computational anatomy: shape, growth, and atrophy comparison via diffeomorphisms |journal = NeuroImage|date = 2004-01-01 |pmid = 15501089|pages = S19–33|volume = 23 Suppl 1|doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.07.021|first = Michael I.|last = Miller|citeseerx = 10.1.1.121.4222}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Geodesic regression for image time-series |journal = Medical Image Computing and Computer-assisted Intervention: MICComputational AnatomyI ...

An observed time sequence is given and the goal is to infer the time flow of geometric change of coordinates carrying the exemplars or templars through the period of observations.

The generic time-series matching problem considers the series of times is &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; t_1 &lt; \dots t_K = 1&lt;/math&gt;. The flow optimizes at the series of costs &lt;math&gt;E(t_k), k=1, \dots, K&lt;/math&gt; giving optimization problems of the form

==Statistical shape theory in computational anatomy==
{{Further|Statistical shape analysis|Shape theory (mathematics)}}

[[Shape]] in computational anatomy is a local theory, indexing shapes and structures to templates to which they are [[bijectively]] mapped. [[Statistical shape analysis|Statistical shape]] in Computational Anatomy is the empirical study of diffeomorphic correspondences between populations and common template coordinate systems.  This is a strong departure from [[Procrustes|Procrustes Analyses]] and shape theories pioneered by [[David George Kendall|David G. Kendall]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Survey of the Statistical Theory of Shape|jstor=2245331|journal = Statistical Science|date = 1989-01-01|pages = 87–99|volume = 4|issue = 2|first = David G.|last = Kendall|doi=10.1214/ss/1177012582}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that the central group of Kendall's theories are the finite-dimensional Lie groups, whereas the theories of shape in Computational Anatomy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1007/978-88-7642-387-1_4|publisher = Scuola Normale Superiore|date = 2012-01-01|isbn = 9788876423888|pages = 43–53|series = Colloquia |first = David|last = Mumford|editor-first = Umberto|editor-last = Zannier|title = Colloquium de Giorgi 2009|chapter = The geometry and curvature of shape spaces}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|edition = 1st|title = Shapes and Diffeomorphisms |author=Laurent Younes |publisher = Springer|date = 2010-05-25|isbn = 9783642120541 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Spaces and Manifolds of Shapes in Computer Vision: An Overview |journal = Image Vision Comput.|date = 2012-06-01 |pages = 389–397|volume = 30|issue = 6–7|doi = 10.1016/j.imavis.2011.09.009|first = Laurent|last = Younes}}&lt;/ref&gt; have focused on the diffeomorphism group, which to first order via the Jacobian can be thought of as a field–thus infinite dimensional–of low-dimensional Lie groups of scale and rotations. 
[[File:Subcortical structures embedded in two-dimensional momentum space.png|alt=showing man sub-cortical structures|thumb|Figure showing hundreds of sub-cortical structures embedded in two-dimensional momentum space generated from the first two eigenvectors of the empirical co-variance estimated from the population of shapes.]]
The random orbit model provides the natural setting to understand empirical shape and shape statistics within Computational anatomy since the non-linearity of the induced probability law on anatomical shapes and forms 
&lt;math&gt; m \in \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt; is induced via the reduction to the vector fields &lt;math&gt; v_0 \in V &lt;/math&gt; at the tangent space at the identity of the diffeomorphism group. The successive flow of the Euler equation induces the random space of shapes and forms &lt;math&gt;Exp_{id}(v_0) \cdot m \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.

Performing empirical statistics on this tangent space at the identity is the natural way for inducing probability laws on the statistics of shape. Since both the vector fields and the Eulerian momentum &lt;math&gt;Av_0&lt;/math&gt; are in a Hilbert space the natural model is one of a Gaussian random field, so that given test function &lt;math&gt;w \in V&lt;/math&gt;, then the inner-products with the test functions are Gaussian distributed with mean and covariance.

This is depicted in the accompanying figure where sub-cortical brain structures are depicted in a two-dimensional coordinate system based on inner products of their initial vector fields that generate them from the template is shown in a 2-dimensional span of the Hilbert space.

'''Computational anatomy (CA)''' is a discipline within [[medical imaging]]  focusing on the study of anatomical shape and form at the visible or [[Gross anatomy|gross anatomical]] scale of [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]. 
The field is broadly defined and includes foundations in [[anatomy]], [[applied mathematics]] and [[pure mathematics]], including [[medical imaging]], [[neuroscience]], [[physics]], [[probability]], and [[statistics]]. It focuses on the anatomical structures being imaged, rather than the medical imaging devices. 
The central focus of the sub-field of [[computational anatomy]] within [[medical imaging]] is mapping information across anatomical coordinate systems most often dense information measured within a [[magnetic resonance imaging|magnetic resonance image]] (MRI). The introduction of flows into CA, which are akin to the equations of motion used in fluid dynamics, exploit the notion that dense coordinates in image analysis follow the [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Lagrangian and Eulerian]] equations of motion. In models based on Lagrangian and Eulerian flows of diffeomorphisms, the constraint is associated to topological properties, such as open sets being preserved, coordinates not crossing implying uniqueness and existence of the inverse mapping, and connected sets remaining connected.  The use of diffeomorphic methods grew quickly to dominate the field of mapping methods post Christensen's&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== The main statistical model==

[[File:Source-channel-model-Shannon.png|thumb|Source-channel model showing the source of images the deformable template &lt;math&gt;I \doteq \varphi \cdot I_\mathrm{temp} \in \mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; and channel output associated with MRI sensor &lt;math&gt;I^D \in \mathcal{I}^{\mathcal{D}}&lt;/math&gt;]]
The central statistical model of Computational Anatomy in the context of [[medical imaging]] has been the source-channel model of [[Shannon theory]]; the source is the deformable template of images &lt;math&gt; I \in \mathcal {I} &lt;/math&gt;, the channel outputs are the imaging sensors with observables &lt;math&gt; I^D \in {\mathcal I}^{\mathcal D} &lt;/math&gt; (see Figure). The importance of the source-channel model is that the variation in the anatomical configuration are modelled separated from the sensor variations of the Medical imagery. The [[Bayes' theorem|Bayes theory]] dictates that the model is characterized by the prior on the source, &lt;math&gt; \pi_{\mathcal{I}} (\cdot) &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;I \in \mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt;, and the conditional density on the observable

: &lt;math&gt; p(\cdot \mid I) \text{ on } I^D \in {\mathcal I}^{\mathcal D} &lt;/math&gt;

conditioned on &lt;math&gt; I \in \mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt;.

In deformable template theory, the images are linked to the templates, with the deformations a group which acts on the template;
see [[Group actions in computational anatomy|group action in computational anatomy]]
For image action &lt;math&gt;I(g) \doteq g \cdot I_\mathrm{temp}, g \in \mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt;,  then the prior on the group &lt;math&gt;\pi_{\mathcal{G}} (\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; induces the prior on images &lt;math&gt;\pi_{\mathcal{I}} (\cdot)&lt;/math&gt;, written as densities the log-posterior takes the form

:&lt;math&gt;
\log p(I(g)\mid I^D) \simeq \log p(I^D \mid I(g))+ \log \pi_{\mathcal{G}}(g).
&lt;/math&gt;

The random orbit model which follows specifies how to generate the group elements and therefore the random spray of objects which form the prior distribution.

For the study of deformable shape in CA, the high-dimensional diffeomorphism groups used in computational anatomy are generated via smooth flows &lt;math&gt; \varphi_t,  t \in [0,1] &lt;/math&gt; which satisfy the Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow fields satisfying the ordinary differential equation: [[File:Lagrangian flow.png|thumb|Showing the Lagrangian flow of coordinates &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; with associated vector fields &lt;math&gt;v_t, t \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; satisfying ordinary differential equation &lt;math&gt;\dot \varphi_t = v_t(\varphi_t), \varphi_0=id&lt;/math&gt;.]]

with &lt;math&gt; v \doteq (v_1,v_2,v_3) &lt;/math&gt; the vector fields on &lt;math&gt;  {\mathbb R}^3   &lt;/math&gt; termed the [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Eulerian]] velocity of the particles at position &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; of the flow. The vector fields are functions in a function space, modelled as a smooth [[Hilbert space|Hilbert]] space with the vector fields having 1-continuous derivative . For &lt;math&gt;v_t = \dot \varphi_t \circ \varphi_t^{-1}, t \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, the inverse of the flow is given by

The integral is calculated by integration by parts when &lt;math&gt;Av&lt;/math&gt; is a generalized function  in the dual space &lt;math&gt; V^*&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Riemannian exponential ===

{{Further|Riemannian metric and Lie-bracket in computational anatomy}}
In the [[Computational anatomy|random orbit model of computational anatomy]], the entire flow is reduced to the initial condition which forms the coordinates encoding the diffeomorphism. From the initial condition &lt;math&gt; v_0 &lt;/math&gt; then geodesic positioning  with respect to the [[Computational anatomy#Diffeomorphometry and the metric space of shapes and forms|Riemannian metric]] of Computational anatomy solves for the flow of the Euler-Lagrange equation.
Solving the geodesic from the initial condition &lt;math&gt; v_0 &lt;/math&gt; is termed the '''Riemannian-exponential,''' a mapping &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(\cdot): V \to \operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt; at identity to the group.

The Riemannian exponential satisfies &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id} (v_0)= \varphi_1 &lt;/math&gt; for initial condition &lt;math&gt;\dot \varphi_0 = v_0&lt;/math&gt;, vector field dynamics &lt;math&gt;\dot \varphi_t = v_t \circ \varphi_t, t \in [0,1]
&lt;/math&gt;,
* for classical equation diffeomorphic shape momentum &lt;math&gt;  \int_X Av_t \cdot w \, dx &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Av \in V&lt;/math&gt;, then

:: &lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt} Av_t +  (Dv_t)^T Av_t +(DAv_t)v_t + ( \nabla \cdot v) Av_t =0  \ ;
&lt;/math&gt;
* for generalized equation, then &lt;math&gt;
Av \in V^* &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; w \in V &lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; \int_X \frac{d}{dt} Av_t \cdot w dx + \int_X Av_t \cdot ((Dv_t)w-(Dw)v_t)dx =0 . &lt;/math&gt;
It is extended to the entire group, &lt;math&gt;
\varphi= \mathrm{Exp}_\varphi(v_0\circ \varphi) \doteq \mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id} (v_0) \circ \varphi.
&lt;/math&gt;
Depicted in the accompanying figure is a depiction of the random orbits around each exemplar, &lt;math&gt;m_0 \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, generated by randomizing the flow by generating the initial tangent space vector field at the identity &lt;math&gt;v_0 \in V&lt;/math&gt;, and then generating random object &lt;math&gt;n \doteq Exp_{id}(v_0) \cdot m_0 \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.
[[File:Synthesized cortical structures from common template.png|alt=Figure shows randomly synthesized structures|thumb|Figure showing the random spray of synthesized subcortical structures laid out in the two-dimensional grid representing the variance of the eigenfunction used for the momentum for synthesis.]]
Shown in the Figure on the right the cartoon orbit, are a random spray of the subcortical manifolds generated by randomizing the vector fields &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt; supported over the submanifolds.The random orbit model induces the prior on shapes and images &lt;math&gt;I \in \mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; conditioned on a particular atlas &lt;math&gt;
I_a \in \mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;. For this the generative model generates the mean field &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; as a random change in coordinates of the template according to &lt;math&gt;
I \doteq \varphi \cdot I_a &lt;/math&gt;, where the diffeomorphic change in coordinates is generated randomly via the geodesic flows.

==MAP estimation in the multiple-atlas orbit model==
The random orbit model induces the prior on shapes and images &lt;math&gt;I \in \mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; conditioned on a particular atlas &lt;math&gt; I_a \in \mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;. For this the generative model generates the mean field &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt; as a random change in coordinates of the template according to &lt;math&gt;I \doteq \varphi \cdot I_a 
&lt;/math&gt;, where the diffeomorphic change in coordinates is generated randomly via the geodesic flows. The prior on random transformations &lt;math&gt;\pi_\mathrm{Diff} (d\varphi) &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Diff}_V&lt;/math&gt; is induced by the flow &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v)&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;
v \in V &lt;/math&gt; constructed as a Gaussian random field prior &lt;math&gt; \pi_V(dv) &lt;/math&gt;. The density on the random observables at the output of the sensor &lt;math&gt;I^D \in \mathcal{I}^D&lt;/math&gt; are given by

: &lt;math&gt;
p(I^D\mid I_a) = \int_V p(I^D \mid \operatorname{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v) \cdot I_a ) \pi_V (dv) \ .
&lt;/math&gt;

[[Maximum a posteriori estimation]] (MAP) estimation is central to modern [[statistical theory]]. Parameters of interest &lt;math&gt; \theta \in \Theta &lt;/math&gt; take many forms including (i) disease type such as [[neurodegenerative]] or [[neurodevelopmental]] diseases,  (ii) structure type such as cortical or subcorical structures in problems associated to segmentation of images, and (iii) template reconstruction from populations.  Given the observed image &lt;math&gt; I^D  &lt;/math&gt;, MAP estimation maximizes the posterior:

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat \theta \doteq \arg \max_{\theta \in \Theta} \log p(\theta \mid I^D). &lt;/math&gt;

This requires computation of the conditional probabilities &lt;math&gt;p(\theta\mid I^D) = \frac{p(I^D,\theta)}{p(I^D)}&lt;/math&gt;.  The multiple atlas orbit model randomizes over the denumerable set of atlases &lt;math&gt;\{ I_a, a \in \mathcal{A} \}&lt;/math&gt;. The model on images in the orbit take the form of a multi-modal mixture distribution

:&lt;math&gt;p(I^D, \theta) = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}}  p(I^D,\theta\mid  I_a) \pi_{\mathcal A}(a) \ .&lt;/math&gt;

The conditional Gaussian model has been examined heavily for inexact matching in dense images and for alndmark matching.

===Dense Image Matching===  
Model &lt;math&gt; I^D(x), x \in X &lt;/math&gt; as a conditionally Gaussian random field conditioned, mean field,  &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1 \cdot I \doteq I(\varphi_1^{-1}), \varphi_1 \in Diff_V&lt;/math&gt;. For uniform variance the endpoint error terms plays the role of the log-conditional (only a function of the mean field) giving the endpoint term:
{{NumBlk|:|
:&lt;math&gt;
-\log p(I^D \mid  I(g)) \simeq E(\varphi_1) \doteq  \frac{1}{2 \sigma^2} \| I^D - I \circ \varphi_1^{-1} \|^2.
&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|Conditional-Gaussian}}}}

=== Landmark Matching ===
Model &lt;math&gt;Y = \{ y_1,y_2,\dots \}&lt;/math&gt; as conditionally Gaussian with mean field &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1 (x_i), i=1,2,\dots, \varphi_1 \in Diff_V&lt;/math&gt;, constant noise variance independent of landmarks. The log-conditional (only a function of the mean field) can be viewed as the endpoint term:
:&lt;math&gt; -\log p(I^D \mid I(g))\simeq \operatorname{E}(\varphi_1) \doteq  \frac{1}{2 \sigma^2}\sum_i \| y_i -\varphi_1(x_i) \|^2. &lt;/math&gt;

==MAP segmentation based on multiple atlases==
The random orbit model for multiple atlases models the orbit of shapes as the union over multiple anatomical orbits generated from the group action of diffeomorphisms, &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{I} = \textstyle  \bigcup_{a \in \mathcal{A}}\displaystyle \operatorname{Diff}_V \cdot I_a &lt;/math&gt;, with each atlas having a template and predefined segmentation field &lt;math&gt; (I_a,W_a),a = a_1,a_2,\ldots &lt;/math&gt;. incorporating the parcellation into anatomical structures of the coordinate of the MRI.. The pairs are indexed over the voxel lattice &lt;math&gt;I_a(x_i),W_a(x_i), x_i \in X \subset {\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt; with an MRI image and a dense labelling of every voxel coordinate.The anatomical labelling of parcellated structures are manual delineations by neuroanatomists.

The Bayes segmentation problem&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Bayesian Parameter Estimation and Segmentation in the Multi-Atlas Random Orbit Model |journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2013-06-18|pmc = 3688886|pmid = 23824159|pages = e65591|volume = 8|issue = 6|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0065591|first = Xiaoying|last = Tang|first2 = Kenichi|last2 = Oishi|first3 = Andreia V.|last3 = Faria|first4 = Argye E.|last4 = Hillis|first5 = Marilyn S.|last5 = Albert|first6 = Susumu|last6 = Mori|first7 = Michael I.|last7 = Miller|bibcode = 2013PLoSO...865591T}}&lt;/ref&gt; is given measurement &lt;math&gt;I^D&lt;/math&gt; with mean field and parcellation &lt;math&gt;(I,W)&lt;/math&gt;, the anatomical labelling &lt;math&gt;\theta \doteq W&lt;/math&gt;. mustg be estimated for the measured MRI image. The mean-field of the observable &lt;math&gt; I^D  &lt;/math&gt; image is modelled as a random deformation from one of the templates &lt;math&gt; I \doteq \varphi \cdot I_a &lt;/math&gt;, which is also randomly selected, &lt;math&gt; A = a &lt;/math&gt;,. The optimal diffeomorphism &lt;math&gt; \varphi  \in \mathcal{G} &lt;/math&gt; is hidden and acts on the background space of coordinates of the randomly selected template image &lt;math&gt; I_a  &lt;/math&gt;. Given a single atlas &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt;, the likelihood model for inference is determined by the joint probability &lt;math&gt; p(I^D,W\mid A = a) &lt;/math&gt;; with multiple atlases, the fusion of the likelihood functions yields the multi-modal mixture model with the prior averaging over models.

The MAP estimator of segmentation  &lt;math&gt; W_a  &lt;/math&gt;  is the maximizer  &lt;math&gt; \max_{W} \log p(W \mid I^D) &lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt; I^D  &lt;/math&gt;, which involves the mixture over all atlases.
:&lt;math&gt; \hat W \doteq \arg \textstyle \max_W \displaystyle \log p(I^D,W) \text{ with }  p(I^D,W) =\textstyle \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \displaystyle p(I^D,W\mid A = a)\pi _A(a). &lt;/math&gt;

The quantity &lt;math&gt; p(I^D,W) &lt;/math&gt; is computed via a fusion of likelihoods from multiple deformable atlases, with &lt;math&gt; \pi _A(a) &lt;/math&gt; being the prior probability that the observed image evolves from the specific template image &lt;math&gt; I_a &lt;/math&gt;.

The MAP segmentation can be iteratively solved via the [[Expectation–maximization algorithm|expectation-maximization]](EM) algorithm

:&lt;math&gt; W^\text{new} \doteq \arg \max_W \int \log p(W,{I^D},A, \varphi ) \, dp(A,\varphi |W^\text{old},I^D). &lt;/math&gt;

== MAP Estimation of volume templates from populations and the EM algorithm ==
Generating templates empirically from populations is a fundamental operation ubiquitous to the discipline.
Several methods based on Bayesian statistics have emerged for submanifolds and dense image volumes.
For the dense image volume case, given the observable &lt;math&gt; I^{D_1}, I^{D_2}, \dots &lt;/math&gt; the problem is to estimate the template in the orbit of dense images &lt;math&gt; I \in \mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt;.  Ma's procedure takes an initial hypertemplate &lt;math&gt; I_0 \in \mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt; as the starting point, and models the template in the orbit under the unknown to be estimated diffeomorphism &lt;math&gt; I \doteq \varphi_0 \cdot I_0 &lt;/math&gt;, with the parameters to be estimated the log-coordinates &lt;math&gt;\theta \doteq v_0&lt;/math&gt; determining the geodesic mapping of the hyper-template &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v_0) \cdot I_0 = I \in \mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;.

In the [[Computational anatomy#The random orbit model of computational anatomy|Bayesian random orbit model of computational anatomy]] the observed MRI images &lt;math&gt;I^{D_i}&lt;/math&gt; are modelled as a conditionally Gaussian random field with mean field &lt;math&gt;\varphi_i \cdot I&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\varphi_i&lt;/math&gt; a random unknown transformation of the template.  The MAP estimation problem is to estimate the unknown template &lt;math&gt; I \in \mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; given the observed MRI images.

Ma's procedure for dense imagery takes an initial hypertemplate &lt;math&gt; I_0 \in \mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt; as the starting point, and models the template in the orbit under the unknown to be estimated diffeomorphism &lt;math&gt; I \doteq \varphi_0 \cdot I_0 &lt;/math&gt;.  The observables are modelled as conditional random fields, &lt;math&gt; I^{D_i} &lt;/math&gt; a {{EquationNote|conditional-Gaussian}} random field with mean field &lt;math&gt; \varphi_i \cdot I \doteq \varphi_i \cdot \varphi_0 \cdot I_0 &lt;/math&gt;.  The unknown variable to be estimated explicitly by MAP is the mapping of the hyper-template &lt;math&gt; \varphi_0&lt;/math&gt;, with the other mappings considered as nuisance or hidden variables which are integrated out via the Bayes procedure.  This is accomplished using the [[expectation-maximization]] (EM) algorithm.

The orbit-model is exploited by associating the unknown to be estimated flows to their log-coordinates &lt;math&gt;v_i,i=1,\dots&lt;/math&gt; [[Computational anatomy#Riemannian exponential (geodesic positioning) and Riemannian logarithm (geodesic coordinates)|via the Riemannian geodesic log and exponential]] for [[computational anatomy]] the initial vector field in the tangent space at the identity so that &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v_{i}) \doteq \varphi_i &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v_{0}) &lt;/math&gt; the mapping of the hyper-template.
The MAP estimation problem becomes

:&lt;math&gt;
\max_{v_0} p(I^D, \theta = v_0) = \int p(I^D, \theta= v_0\mid v_1,v_2, \dots ) \pi(v_1,v_2, \dots ) \, dv
&lt;/math&gt;

The EM algorithm takes as complete data the vector-field coordinates parameterizing the mapping, &lt;math&gt;v_i,i=1,\dots&lt;/math&gt; and compute iteratively the conditional-expectation
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
Q(\theta=v_0; \theta^\text{old}=v_0^\text{old}) &amp;
= - \operatorname{E} ( \log p(I^D, \theta=v_0 \mid v_1,v_2,\dots)|I^D, \theta^\text{old}) \\
&amp; = - \| ( \bar I^\text{old} - I_0 \circ \mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v_0)^{-1} ) \sqrt{\beta^\text{old}} \|^2 - \|v_0\|_V^2
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
* Compute new template maximizing Q-function, setting &lt;math&gt;\theta^\text{new}\doteq v_0^\text{new} = \arg \max_{\theta = v_0} Q(\theta ; \theta^\text{old}=v_0^\text{old}) = - \| ( \bar I^\text{old} - I_0 \circ \mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v_0)^{-1} ) \sqrt{\beta^\text{old}}\|^2
- \| v_0\|_V^2&lt;/math&gt;
* Compute the mode-approximation for the expectation updating the expected-values for the mode values:
:: &lt;math&gt;v_i^\text{new} = \arg \max_{v: \dot \varphi = v \circ \varphi } - \int_0^1 \| v_t \|_V^2 \, dt - \| I^{D_i} - I_0 \circ \mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v_0^\text{old})^{-1} \circ \mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v)^{-1}  \|^2. i=1,2,\dots&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\beta^\text{new} (x) = \sum_{i=1}^n | D \mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v_i^\text{new})(x) |, \text{ with } \bar I^\text{new} (x) = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n I^{D_i} \circ \mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v_i^\text{new}) | D \mathrm{Exp}_\mathrm{id}(v_i^\text{new})(x) |  }{ \beta^\text{old}(x)}&lt;/math&gt;

'''[[Group action]]s''' are central to [[Riemannian geometry]] and defining [[Orbit (control theory)|orbits (control theory)]]. 
The orbits of [[computational anatomy]] consist of [[Computational anatomy#Shapes and forms|anatomical shapes and medical images]]; the anatomical  shapes are submanifolds of [[differential geometry]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; consisting of points, curves, surfaces and subvolumes,.
This generalized the ideas of the more familiar orbits of [[linear algebra]] which are [[Vector space|linear vector spaces]].   Medical images are scalar and tensor images from [[medical imaging]]. The group actions are used to define models of human shape which accommodate variation. These orbits are deformable templates as originally formulated more abstractly in [[pattern theory]].

==The orbit model of computational anatomy==
The central model of human anatomy in computational anatomy is  a [[Computational anatomy#Orbits and groups actions|Groups and group action]], a classic formulation from [[differential geometry]].  The orbit is called the space of [[Computational anatomy#Shapes and forms|shapes and forms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Michael I.|last2=Younes|first2=Laurent|last3=Trouvé|first3=Alain|date=2014-03-01|title=Diffeomorphometry and geodesic positioning systems for human anatomy|journal=Technology|volume=2|issue=1|pages=36|doi=10.1142/S2339547814500010|issn=2339-5478|pmc=4041578|pmid=24904924}}&lt;/ref&gt; The space of shapes are denoted &lt;math&gt;m \in \mathcal {M}&lt;/math&gt;, with the [[group action|group]] &lt;nowiki/&gt; &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{ G}, \circ )&lt;/math&gt; with law of composition &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt;; the action of the group on shapes is denoted &lt;math&gt;g \cdot m&lt;/math&gt;, where the action of the group &lt;math&gt;g \cdot m \in \mathcal{M}, m \in \mathcal {M}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to satisfy 
:&lt;math&gt; (g \circ g^\prime) \cdot m = g \cdot (g^\prime \cdot m)\in \mathcal { M} .&lt;/math&gt;

The orbit &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt; of the template becomes the space of all shapes, &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M} \doteq \{ m  = g \cdot m_\mathrm{temp}, g \in \mathcal{G} \}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Several group actions in computational anatomy==
{{Main|Computational anatomy}}
The central group in CA defined on volumes in  &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt; are [[Computational anatomy#The diffeomorphism group of computational anatomy|the diffeomorphism group]]  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G} \doteq \mathrm{Diff}&lt;/math&gt; which are mappings with 3-components &lt;math&gt;\phi(\cdot) = (\phi_1(\cdot),\phi_2 (\cdot),\phi_3 (\cdot))&lt;/math&gt;, law of composition of functions &lt;math&gt; \phi \circ \phi^\prime (\cdot)\doteq \phi (\phi^\prime(\cdot)) &lt;/math&gt;, with inverse &lt;math&gt; \phi \circ \phi^{-1}(\cdot) =\phi ( \phi^{-1}(\cdot))= \operatorname{id}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Submanifolds: organs, subcortical structures, charts, and immersions===
For sub-[[manifold]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s &lt;math&gt; X \subset {\mathbb R}^3 \in \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt;, parametrized by a chart or [[immersion (mathematics)|immersion]] &lt;math&gt; m(u), u \in U &lt;/math&gt;, the diffeomorphic action the flow of the position

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi \cdot m(u) \doteq \phi\circ m(u), u \in U
&lt;/math&gt;.

===Scalar images such as MRI, CT, PET===
Most popular are scalar images, &lt;math&gt;I(x),x \in {\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt;, with action on the right via the inverse.
:&lt;math&gt;
\phi \cdot I(x) = I \circ \phi^{-1} (x), x \in {\mathbb R}^3

===Oriented tangents on curves, eigenvectors  of tensor matrices===
Many different imaging modalities are being used with various actions. For images such that &lt;math&gt; I(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a three-dimensional vector then

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi\cdot I = ((D\varphi) \, I)\circ \varphi^{-1} , &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi \star I =  ((D\varphi^T)^{-1}I) \circ \varphi^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Tensor matrices===
Cao et al.
&lt;ref&gt;Cao Y1, Miller MI, Winslow RL, Younes, Large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping of vector fields. IEEE Trans Med Imaging. 2005 Sep;24(9):1216-30.
&lt;/ref&gt; 
examined actions for mapping MRI images measured via diffusion tensor imaging and represented via there principle eigenvector. 
For tensor fields a positively oriented orthonormal basis 
&lt;math&gt;I(x) = (I_1 (x), I_2(x), I_3(x)) &lt;/math&gt;
of &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt;, termed frames, vector cross product denoted &lt;math&gt; I_1 \times I_2 &lt;/math&gt; then
:&lt;math&gt;
\varphi\cdot I =
  \left(\frac{D\varphi I_1}{\|D\varphi\,I_1\|}, \frac{(D\varphi^{ T})^{-1} I_3 \times
    D\varphi\,I_1}{\|(D\varphi^{ T})^{-1} I_3 \times D \varphi\,I_1\|}, 
\frac{(D\varphi^{ T})^{-1} I_3}{\|(D\varphi^{ T})^{-1} I_3\|}\right)\circ \varphi^{-1} \ ,
&lt;/math&gt;
The Fr\'enet frame of three orthonormal vectors, &lt;math&gt; I_1 &lt;/math&gt; deforms as a tangent, &lt;math&gt;
I_3
&lt;/math&gt; deforms like
a normal to the plane generated by &lt;math&gt;
I_1 \times I_2
&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;
I_3
&lt;/math&gt;. H is uniquely constrained by the
basis being positive and orthonormal.

For &lt;math&gt;
3 \times 3
&lt;/math&gt; non-negative symmetric matrices, an action would become &lt;math&gt;
\varphi \cdot I = (D\varphi\, I D\varphi^{T})\circ
\varphi^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Orientation Distribution Function and High Angular Resolution HARDI===

{{Further|Computational_anatomy#Diffusion_tensor_image_matching_in_computational_anatomy|LDDMM#LDDMM ODF}}

Orientation distribution function (ODF) characterizes the angular profile of the diffusion probability density function of water molecules and can be reconstructed from High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI). The ODF is a probability density function defined on a unit sphere, &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb{S}}^2 &lt;/math&gt;. In the field of [[information geometry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Amari|first1=S|title=Differential-Geometrical Methods in Statistics|date=1985|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; the space of ODF forms a Riemannian manifold with the Fisher-Rao metric. For the purpose of LDDMM ODF mapping, the square-root representation is chosen because it is one of the most efficient representations found to date as the various Riemannian operations, such as geodesics, exponential maps, and logarithm maps, are available in closed form. In the following, denote square-root ODF (&lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{\text{ODF}}} &lt;/math&gt;) as &lt;math&gt; \psi({\bf s}) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \psi({\bf s}) &lt;/math&gt; is non-negative to ensure uniqueness and &lt;math&gt; \int_{{\bf s}\in  {\mathbb{S}}^2} \psi^2({\bf s}) d{\bf s}=1&lt;/math&gt;.

Denote diffeomorphic transformation as &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt;. Group action of diffeomorphism on &lt;math&gt; \psi({\bf s}) &lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\phi \cdot \psi &lt;/math&gt;, needs to guarantee the non-negativity and &lt;math&gt; \int_{{\bf s}\in  {\mathbb{S}}^2} \phi \cdot \psi^2({\bf s}) d{\bf s}=1&lt;/math&gt;. Based on the derivation in,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Du|first1=J|last2=Goh|first2=A|last3=Qiu|first3=A|title=Diffeomorphic metric mapping of high angular resolution diffusion imaging based on Riemannian structure of orientation distribution functions|journal=IEEE Trans Med Imaging|date=2012|volume=31|issue=5|pages=1021–1033|doi=10.1109/TMI.2011.2178253|pmid=22156979}}&lt;/ref&gt; this group action is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(D \phi) \psi\circ \phi^{-1}(x) =   \sqrt{\frac{\det{\bigl(D_{\phi^{-1}}\phi \bigr)^{-1}} }{\left\|{\bigl(D_{\phi^{-1}}\phi \bigr)^{-1} } {\bf s} \right\|^3} } \quad
\psi \left( \frac{(D_{\phi^{-1}}\phi \bigr)^{-1} {\bf s}}{\|(D_{\phi^{-1}}\phi \bigr)^{-1} {\bf s}\|}, \phi^{-1}(x) \right) , 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; (D\phi) &lt;/math&gt; is the Jacobian of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping''' ('''LDDMM''') is a specific suite of algorithms used for diffeomorphic mapping and manipulating dense imagery based on  '''diffeomorphic metric mapping''' within the academic discipline of [[Computational anatomy]], to be distinguished from its precursor based on '''diffeomorphic mapping'''.  The distinction between the two is that diffeomorphic metric maps satisfy the property that the length associated to their flow away from the identity induces a metric on the [[Computational anatomy#The Diffeomorphism Group of Computational Anatomy|group of diffeomorphisms]], which in turn induces a metric on the orbit of [[Computational anatomy#Shapes and forms|Shapes and Forms]] within the field of [[Computational anatomy|Computational Anatomy]]. The study of shapes and forms with the metric of diffeomorphic metric mapping is called [[Computational Anatomy#Diffeomorphometry:the metric space of shapes and forms|Diffeomorphometry]].

A '''diffeomorphic mapping''' system is a system designed to map, manipulate, and transfer information which is stored in many types of spatially distributed medical imagery.

Diffeomorphic mapping is the underlying technology for mapping and analyzing information measured in human anatomical coordinate systems which have been measured via Medical imaging{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. Diffeomorphic mapping is a broad term that actually refers to a number of different algorithms, processes, and methods. It is attached to many operations and has many applications for analysis and visualization. Diffeomorphic mapping can be used to relate various sources of information which are indexed as a function of spatial position as the key index variable. Diffeomorphisms are by their Latin root structure preserving transformations, which are in turn differentiable and therefore smooth, allowing for the calculation of metric based quantities such as arc length and surface areas. Spatial location and extents in human anatomical coordinate systems can be recorded via a variety of Medical imaging modalities, generally termed multi-modal medical imagery, providing either scalar and or vector quantities at each spatial location. Examples are scalar [[T1 (MRI)|T1]] or T2 [[Magnetic resonance imaging|Magnetic resonance imagery]], or as 3x3 diffusion tensor matrices [[Diffusion MRI]] and [[Diffusion-weighted imaging]], to scalar densities associated to [[Computed Tomography]] (CT), or functional imagery such as temporal data of [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] and scalar densities such as [[Positron emission tomography|Positron emission tomography (PET)]].

Computational anatomy is a subdiscipline within the broader field of [[Neuroinformatics]] within [[Bioinformatics]] and [[Medical imaging]]. The first algorithm for dense image mapping via diffeomorphic metric mapping was Beg's LDDMM&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220660081|title=Computing Large Deformation Metric Mappings via Geodesic Flows of Diffeomorphisms|journal=International Journal of Computer Vision|doi=10.1023/B:VISI.0000043755.93987.aa|access-date=2016-01-27|author1=M.F.

In a more general sense, diffeomorphic mapping is any solution that registers or builds correspondences between dense coordinate systems in Medical imaging by ensuring the solutions are diffeomorphic.

The distinction between diffeomorphic metric mapping forming the basis for LDDMM and the earliest methods of diffeomorphic mapping is the introduction of a Hamilton principle of least-action in which large deformations are selected of shortest length corresponding to geodesic flows. This important distinction arises from the original formulation of the [[Riemannian metric and Lie-bracket in computational anatomy|Riemannian metric]] corresponding to the right-invariance. The lengths of these geodesics give the metric in the metric space structure of human anatomy. Non-geodeisc formulations of diffeomorphic mapping in general does not correspond to any metric formulation.

The central focus of the sub-field of '''[[Computational anatomy]] (CA)''' within [[medical imaging]]  is mapping information across anatomical coordinate systems at the 1 millimeter [[morphome]] scale. In CA mapping of dense information measured within [[Magnetic resonance imaging|Magnetic resonance image]] (MRI) based coordinate systems such as in the brain has been solved via inexact matching of 3D MR images one onto the other. The earliest introduction of the use of '''diffeomorphic mapping''' via '''large deformation''' flows of [[diffeomorphisms]] for transformation of coordinate systems in image analysis and medical imaging was by Christensen, Rabbitt and Miller &lt;ref name="Christensen 1435–1447"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Deformable Templates Using Large Deformation Kinematics|journal = Trans.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of flows, which are akin to the equations of motion used in fluid dynamics, exploit the notion that dense coordinates in image analysis follow the [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Lagrangian and Eulerian]] equations of motion. This model becomes more appropriate for cross-sectional studies in which brains and or hearts are not necessarily deformations of one to the other. Methods based on linear or non-linear elasticity energetics which grows with distance from the identity mapping of the template, is not appropriate for cross-sectional study. Rather, in models based on Lagrangian and Eulerian flows of diffeomorphisms, the constraint is associated to topological properties, such as open sets being preserved, coordinates not crossing implying uniqueness and existence of the inverse mapping, and connected sets remaining connected.  The use of diffeomorphic methods grew quickly to dominate the field of mapping methods post Christensen's original paper, with fast and symmetric methods becoming available.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Such methods are powerful in that they introduce notions of regularity of the solutions so that they can be differentiated and local inverses can be calculated. The disadvantages of these methods is that there was no associated global least-action property which could score the flows of minimum energy. This contrasts the geodesic motions which are central to the study of  [[Rigid-body kinematics|Rigid body kinematics]] and the many problems solved in [[Physics]] via&lt;nowiki/&gt; [[Hamilton's principal of least action|Hamilton's principle of least action]].

To express the variation in terms of &lt;math&gt; \delta v &lt;/math&gt;, use the solution to the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]]
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d }{d t} \left( \delta \phi_{|\phi} \right) = (Dv)_{| \phi} \delta \phi_{| \phi} + \delta v_{| \phi}&lt;/math&gt; giving
:&lt;math&gt;
\delta \phi_1 = (D \phi_1)_{|\phi_1^{-1}} \int_0^1 (D \phi_t)_{|\phi_1^{-1}}^{-1} (\delta v_t )_{\phi_t \circ \phi_1^{-1} } dt
&lt;/math&gt;

*Image Matching:
Taking the directional derivative of the image endpoint condition &lt;math&gt; E(\phi) = \int_X | I \circ \phi^{-1} - J |^2 dx &lt;/math&gt; gives
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{d \epsilon} \frac{1}{2} \int_X | I \circ ( \phi^{-1} + \epsilon \delta \phi^{-1} \circ \phi^{-1})-J|^2 dx|_{\epsilon =0}
=\int_X (I \circ \phi^{-1} -J ) \nabla I|_{\phi^{-1}} \delta \phi^{-1} \circ \phi^{-1} dx
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;
= \int_X (I \circ \phi^{-1} -J ) \nabla I|_{\phi^{-1}} 
(-D \phi_1^{-1}) \delta \phi dx
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; =\int_X(I \circ \phi_1^{-1} -J) \nabla I|_{\phi_1^{-1}} (- D \phi_1)_{|\phi_1^{-1}}^{-1}(D \phi_1)_{|\phi_1^{-1}}) \int_0^1 (D \phi_t)_{|\phi_1^{-1}}^{-1} (\delta v_t)_{|{\phi_t \circ \phi_1^{-1}}} dt dx
&lt;/math&gt;.
 
Substituting &lt;math&gt;
\phi_{t1} \doteq \phi_1 \circ \phi_t^{-1} &lt;/math&gt; gives the necessary condition for an optimum:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{d \epsilon}C(v +\epsilon\delta v)|_{\epsilon=0} = \int_0^1 \int_X Av_t \cdot \delta v_t dx dt -\int_0^1 \int_X (I \circ \phi_1^{-1} -J) \nabla I|_{\phi_1^{-1}}(D \phi_t)_{|\phi_1^{-1}}^{-1} (\delta v_t)_{|{\phi_t \circ \phi_1^{-1}}} dx dt 
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  = \int_0^1 \int_X \left( Av_t - (I \circ \phi_t^{-1} -J \circ \phi_{t1}) \nabla I|_{\phi_t^{-1}}(D \phi_t)_{|\phi_t^{-1}}^{-1} |D \phi_{t1}| \right) \cdot \delta v_t dxdt = 0 
&lt;/math&gt;.

*Landmark Matching: 
Take the variation in the vector fields &lt;math&gt;v+\epsilon \delta v&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i} |\phi_1(x_i)-y_i)|^2 &lt;/math&gt;
use the chain rule for the perturbation &lt;math&gt; \delta \phi \circ \phi &lt;/math&gt; to gives the first variation

: &lt;math&gt; \sum_i (\phi_1(x_i) - y_i) \cdot D \phi_1 |_{\phi_1^{-1}(\phi_1(x_i))} \int_0^1 (D \phi_t)_{|\phi_1^{-1}(\phi_1(x_i))}^{-1} \delta v_t |_{\phi_t \circ \phi_1^{-1} (\phi_1(x_i))} dt
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; =\int_0^1 \int_X \sum_i \delta_{\phi_t(x_i)}(x) (\phi_1(x_i) - y_i) \cdot (D \phi_1)_{\phi_t^{-1} (x)}(D \phi_t)_{\phi_t^{-1}(x)}^{-1} \delta v_t (x) dx dt
=\int_0^1 \int_X \sum_i \delta_{\phi_t(x_i)}(y) (D \phi_{t1})_{\phi_t(x_i)}^T (\phi_1(x_i) - y_i) \cdot  \delta v_t (x) dx dt
&lt;/math&gt;

==LDDMM Diffusion Tensor Image Matching==
LDDMM matching based on the principal eigenvector of the diffusion tensor matrix
takes the image &lt;math&gt; I(x), x \in {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt; as a unit vector field defined by the first eigenvector.
&lt;ref name="Cao 1379–1386 Vol. 2"/&gt;
The group action becomes
:&lt;math&gt;
\varphi \cdot I =
\begin{cases}
\frac{D_{\varphi^{-1}} \varphi I \circ \varphi^{-1} \|I \circ \varphi^{-1}\|}{\|D_{\varphi^{-1}} \varphi I \circ \varphi^{-1}\|} &amp; I\circ \varphi \neq 0, \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \| \cdot \| &lt;/math&gt; that denotes image squared-error norm.

==LDDMM ODF ==
High angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) addresses the well-known limitation of DTI, that is, DTI can only reveal one dominant fiber orientation at each location. HARDI measures diffusion along &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; uniformly distributed directions on the sphere and can characterize more complex fiber geometries by reconstructing an orientation distribution function (ODF) that characterizes the angular profile of the diffusion probability density function of water molecules. The ODF is a function defined on a unit sphere, &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb{S}}^2 &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Du|first1=J|last2=Goh|first2=A|last3=Qiu|first3=A|title=Diffeomorphic metric mapping of high angular resolution diffusion imaging based on Riemannian structure of orientation distribution functions|journal=IEEE Trans Med Imaging|date=2012|volume=31|issue=5|pages=1021–1033|doi=10.1109/TMI.2011.2178253|pmid=22156979}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Denote the square-root ODF (&lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{\text{ODF}}} &lt;/math&gt;) as &lt;math&gt; \psi({\bf s}) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \psi({\bf s}) &lt;/math&gt; is non-negative to ensure uniqueness and &lt;math&gt; \int_{{\bf s}\in  {\mathbb{S}}^2} \psi^2({\bf s}) d{\bf s}=1&lt;/math&gt;. The metric defines the distance between two &lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{\text{ODF}}} &lt;/math&gt; functions &lt;math&gt; \psi_1, \psi_2 \in \Psi &lt;/math&gt; as 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\rho(\psi_1,\psi_2)=
\|\log_{\psi_1}(\psi_2)\|_{\psi_1} 
=\cos^{-1} \langle \psi_1, \psi_2 \rangle = 
\cos^{-1}\left(\int_{{\bf s}\in {\mathbb{S}}^2} \psi_1({\bf s}) \psi_2({\bf s})d{\bf s}\right),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is the normal dot product between points in the sphere under the &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{L}^2 &lt;/math&gt; metric.
The template and target are denoted
&lt;math&gt; \psi_{\mathrm{temp}}({\bf s},x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\psi_{\mathrm{targ}}({\bf s}, x)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt; {\bf s} \in {{\mathbb{S}}^2} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; x \in X &lt;/math&gt; indexed across the unit sphere and the image domain, with the target indexed similarly.

Define the variational problem assuming that two ODF volumes can be generated from one to another via flows of diffeomorphisms &lt;math&gt; \phi_t &lt;/math&gt;, which are solutions of ordinary differential equations 
&lt;math&gt; \dot \phi_t = v_t (\phi_t), t \in [0,1],\phi_0={id}&lt;/math&gt;. 
The group action of the diffeomorphism on the template is given according to  
&lt;math&gt;\phi_1 \cdot \psi (x)\doteq  (D\phi_1) \psi \circ \phi_1^{-1}(x), x \in X &lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt; (D\phi_1) &lt;/math&gt; is the Jacobian of the affined transformed ODF and is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(D \phi_1) \psi\circ \phi_1^{-1}(x) =   \sqrt{\frac{\det{\bigl(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1}} }{\left\|{\bigl(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1} } {\bf s} \right\|^3} } \quad
\psi \left( \frac{(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1} {\bf s}}{\|(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1} {\bf s}\|}, \phi_1^{-1}(x) \right) .
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The LDDMM variational problem is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\min_{v: \dot \phi_t =
v_t \circ \phi_t,\phi_0={
id}}\int_0^1 \int_{R^3} Av_t \cdot v_t dx \ dt 
 +\lambda \int_{R^3}\|\log_{(D\phi_1) \psi_{\mathrm{temp}} \circ \phi_1^{-1}(x)}(\psi_{\mathrm{targ}}(x))\|^2_{(D\phi_1) \psi_{\mathrm{temp}}\circ \phi_1^{-1}(x)}dx 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;.

{{Main|Computational anatomy}}

[[Computational anatomy|Computational anatomy (CA)]] is the study of shape and form in [[medical imaging]]. The study of deformable shapes in [[computational anatomy]] rely on high-dimensional diffeomorphism groups &lt;math&gt; \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt; which generate orbits of the form &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M} \doteq
\{ \varphi \cdot m \mid \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V \} &lt;/math&gt;. In CA, this orbit is in general considered a smooth [[Riemannian manifold]]
since at every point of the manifold &lt;math&gt; m \in \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt; there is an  [[Inner product space|inner product]] inducing the norm &lt;math&gt; \| \cdot \|_m &lt;/math&gt; on the [[tangent space]]
that varies smoothly from point to point in the manifold of shapes &lt;math&gt; m \in \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt;. This is generated by viewing the
group of diffeomorphisms &lt;math&gt; \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt; as a Riemannian manifold with &lt;math&gt; \| \cdot \|_\varphi  &lt;/math&gt;,  associated to the tangent space at  &lt;math&gt; \varphi \in\operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt; . This induces the norm and metric on the orbit &lt;math&gt; m \in \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt; under the action from the group of diffeomorphisms.

==The diffeomorphisms group generated as Lagrangian and Eulerian flows==
The diffeomorphisms in [[computational anatomy]] are generated to satisfy the [[Computational anatomy#Lagrangian and Eulerian flows for generating diffeomorphisms|Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow fields]], &lt;math&gt; \varphi_t,  t \in [0,1] &lt;/math&gt;, generated via the ordinary differential equation

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt} \varphi_t = v_t \circ \varphi_t , \ \varphi_0 = \operatorname{id}; &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Lagrangian flow}}}}
with the Eulerian vector fields &lt;math&gt; v \doteq (v_1,v_2,v_3) &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;  {\mathbb R}^3   &lt;/math&gt;  for &lt;math&gt;v_t = \dot \varphi_t \circ \varphi_t^{-1}, t \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, with the inverse for the flow given by

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
 \frac{d}{dt} \varphi_t^{-1} = -(D \varphi_t^{-1}) v_t, \ \varphi_0^{-1} = \operatorname{id}, &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eulerianflow}}}}
and the &lt;math&gt;3 \times 3&lt;/math&gt; Jacobian matrix for flows in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;  given as &lt;math&gt; \ D\varphi \doteq \left(\frac{\partial \varphi_i}{\partial x_j}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

==The Riemannian orbit model==
Shapes in [[Computational anatomy|Computational Anatomy (CA)]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;are studied via the use of diffeomorphic mapping for establishing correspondences between anatomical coordinate systems. In this setting, 3-dimensional medical images are modelled as diffemorphic transformations of some exemplar, termed the template &lt;math&gt; I_{temp} &lt;/math&gt;, resulting in the observed images to be elements of the random [[Computational anatomy#The deformable template orbit model of CA|orbit model of CA]]. For images these are defined as &lt;math&gt; I \in \mathcal {I}
\doteq \{ I = I_{temp} \circ \varphi, \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V \} &lt;/math&gt;, with for charts representing sub-manifolds denoted as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} \doteq \{ \varphi \cdot m_{temp} : \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V \}&lt;/math&gt;.

==The Riemannian metric==
The orbit of shapes and forms in Computational Anatomy  are generated by the group action&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} \doteq \{ \varphi \cdot m : \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V \}&lt;/math&gt;.   This is made into a Riemannian orbit by introducing a metric associated to each point and associated tangent space. For this a metric is defined on the group which induces the metric on the orbit. Take as the metric for  [[Computational anatomy]] at each element of the tangent space &lt;math&gt;\varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V&lt;/math&gt; in the group of diffeomorphisms 
:&lt;math&gt; \| \dot \varphi \|_\varphi \doteq \| \dot \varphi \circ \varphi^{-1} \|_V=\| v \|_V &lt;/math&gt;, 
with the vector fields modelled to be in a Hilbert space with the norm in the Hilbert space &lt;math&gt;(V, \| \cdot \|_V )&lt;/math&gt;. We model &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; as a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) defined by a 1-1, differential operator&lt;math&gt; A: V \rightarrow V^*  &lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt; \sigma(v) \doteq Av \in V^*
&lt;/math&gt; a distribution or generalized function, the linear form &lt;math&gt; (\sigma\mid w) \doteq \int_{\mathbb R^3}  \sum_i w_i(x) \sigma_i (dx)
&lt;/math&gt; determines the norm:and inner product for &lt;math&gt;v \in V&lt;/math&gt; according to 
:&lt;math&gt; \langle v , w \rangle_V \doteq \int_X A v \cdot w \, dx, \ \| v\|_V^2 \doteq \int_X A v \cdot v \, dx, \ v,w \in V \ .
&lt;/math&gt;
where the integral is calculated by integration by parts for &lt;math&gt; Av &lt;/math&gt; a generalized function &lt;math&gt; Av \in V^*&lt;/math&gt; the dual-space.
The differential operator is selected so that the Green's kernel associated to the inverse is sufficiently smooth so that the [[Computational anatomy#The Smoothness Condition on Vector fields as Modelled in a Reproducing kernel Hilbert space|vector fields support 1-continuous derivative]].

===The right-invariant metric on diffeomorphisms===
The metric on the group of diffeomorphisms is defined by the distance as defined on pairs of elements in the group of diffeomorphisms according to

{{NumBlk||&lt;math&gt; d_{\operatorname{Diff}_V} (\psi, \varphi) = \inf_{v_t} \left(\frac 1 2 \int_0^1 \int_X Av_t \cdot v_t \,dx \  dt : \varphi_0 = \psi, \varphi_1 = \varphi, \dot \varphi_t = v_t \circ \varphi_t \right)^{1/2} \ .
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|metric-diffeomorphisms}}}}

This distance provides a right-invariant metric of diffeomorphometry,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=M.

==The Lie bracket in the group of diffeomorphisms==
The [[Lie bracket]] gives the adjustment of the velocity term resulting from a perturbation of the motion in the setting of curved spaces. Using [[Hamilton's principle]] of least-action derives the optimizing flows as a critical point for the action integral of the integral of the kinetic energy. The Lie bracket for vector fields in Computational Anatomy was first introduced in Miller, Trouve and Younes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MILLER|first=MICHAEL I.|last2=TROUVÉ|first2=ALAIN|last3=YOUNES|first3=LAURENT|date=2006-01-31|title=Geodesic Shooting for Computational Anatomy|journal=Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision|volume=24|issue=2|pages=209–228|doi=10.1007/s10851-005-3624-0|issn=0924-9907|pmc=2897162|pmid=20613972}}&lt;/ref&gt; The derivation calculates the perturbation &lt;math&gt; \delta v &lt;/math&gt; on the vector fields
&lt;math&gt; v^\varepsilon = v + \varepsilon \delta v &lt;/math&gt;   in terms of the derivative in time of the group perturbation  adjusted by the correction of the [[Lie bracket of vector fields]] in this function setting involving the Jacobian matrix, unlike the matrix group case:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; ad_v:V \mapsto V &lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt; ad_v(w)\doteq (Dv)w - (Dw)v ,   v,w \in V .&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|adjoint-Lie-bracket}}}}

'''Proof:'''
Proving [[Lie bracket of vector fields]] take a first order perturbation of the flow at point &lt;math&gt; \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt;.
{{hidden |

Taking the first order perturbation gives &lt;math&gt; \varphi_t^\varepsilon \doteq 
(\operatorname{id} + \varepsilon w) \circ \varphi = \varphi+\varepsilon w \circ \varphi &lt;/math&gt;, with fixed boundary &lt;math&gt; w_0= w_1=0 &lt;/math&gt;, with  &lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dt} \varphi_t^\varepsilon = v_t^\varepsilon \circ \varphi_t^\varepsilon, \varphi_0^\varepsilon = \operatorname{id} , \varphi_1^\varepsilon = \varphi_1&lt;/math&gt;, giving the following two Eqns:  
:* &lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt} \varphi_t^\varepsilon = \frac{d}{dt} \varphi_t + \varepsilon \frac{d}{dt}(w_t \circ \varphi_t ) =v_t \circ \varphi_t + (D w_t)\circ \varphi_t v_t \circ \varphi_t +o(\varepsilon)\ .
&lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt; \dot \varphi_t^\varepsilon = (v_t + \varepsilon \delta v_t) \circ (\varphi_t + \varepsilon w_t \circ \varphi_t) \simeq v_t \circ \varphi_t +\varepsilon (Dv_t)\circ \varphi_t w_t \circ \varphi_t + \delta v_t \circ \varphi_t +o(\varepsilon) \ .
&lt;/math&gt;
Equating the above two equations gives the perturbation of the vector field in terms of the Lie bracket adjustment.
}}
The Lie bracket gives the first order variation of the vector field with respect to first order variation of the flow.
:&lt;math&gt; \delta v_t = \frac{d}{d t} w_t - ad_{v_t}(w_t) =\frac{d}{d t} w_t- ((Dv_t) w_t - (Dw_t)v_t) \ . &lt;/math&gt;

==The generalized Euler–Lagrange equation for the metric on diffeomorphic flows ==
{{Main|Computational anatomy|Computational anatomy#The Euler–Lagrange equation on shape momentum for geodesics on the group of diffeomorphisms}}
The Euler–Lagrange equation can be used to calculate geodesic flows through the group which form the basis for the metric. The [[Computational anatomy#The Action Integral for Hamilton's Principle on the Lagrangian Kinetic Energy|action integral for the Lagrangian of the kinetic energy]] for Hamilton's principle becomes 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
J(\varphi) \doteq \frac{1}{2}\int_0^1 \| \dot \varphi_t \|_{\varphi_t}^2 \,dt = \frac{1}{2}\int_0^1  \| \dot \varphi_t \circ \varphi_t^{-1} \|_V^2 \,dt =\frac{1}{2}\int_0^1  \int_X A (\dot \varphi_t \circ \varphi_t^{-1})\cdot (\dot \varphi_t \circ \varphi_t^{-1}) \, dx \,dt \ .
&lt;/math&gt; |{{EquationRef|Hamilton's Action Integral}}}}
The action integral in terms of the vector field corresponds to integrating the kinetic energy
:&lt;math&gt;
 J(v) \doteq \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 \| v_t \|_V^2 dt = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 \int_X Av_t \cdot v_t \,dx \ dt
\ .
&lt;/math&gt;
The shortest paths geodesic connections in the orbit are defined via [[Hamilton's principal of least action|Hamilton's Principle of least action]] requires first order variations of the solutions in the orbits of Computational Anatomy which are based on computing critical points on the metric length or energy of the path.

==Riemannian exponential for positioning==
In the [[Computational anatomy|random orbit model of Computational anatomy]], the entire flow is reduced to the initial condition which forms the coordinates encoding the diffeomorphism, as well as providing the means of positioning information in the orbit.

==The variation problem for matching or registering coordinate system information in computational anatomy==
{{Further information | Large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping}}
Matching information across coordinate systems is central to [[computational anatomy]]. Adding a matching term &lt;math&gt;E: \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V \rightarrow R^+&lt;/math&gt; to the action integral of Equation ({{EquationNote|Hamilton's action integral}})
which represents the target endpoint 
:&lt;math&gt;C(\varphi) \doteq \int_0^1 \int_X Av_t \cdot v_t \,dx \, dt + E(\varphi_1) \ .&lt;/math&gt;
The endpoint term adds a boundary condition for the Euler–Lagrange equation ({{EquationNote|EL-General}})
which gives the Euler equation with boundary term. Taking the variation gives
*Necessary geodesic condition:

Plasmons are a quantity of collective electron oscillations. Excitons are excited electrons bound to the hole produced by their excitation.&lt;ref name="atlas" /&gt;

Molecular crystal excitons were combined with the collective excitations within metals to create plexcitons. This allowed EET to reach distances of around 20,000 nanometers, an enormous increase over the some 10 nanometers possible previously. However, the transfer direction was uncontrolled.&lt;ref name="atlas" /&gt;

[[Topological insulators]] (TI) act as insulators below their surface, but have conductive surfaces, constraining [[electrons]] to move only along that surface. Even materials with moderately flawed surfaces do not impede current flow.&lt;ref name="atlas" /&gt; Topological plexcitons make use of the properties of TIs to achieve similar control over the direction of current flow.&lt;ref name="atlas" /&gt;

Plexcitons were found to emerge from an organic molecular layer (excitons) and a metallic film (plasmons). [[Dirac cone]]s appeared in the plexcitons' two-dimensional band-structure. An external magnetic field created a gap between the cones when the system was interfaced to a magneto-optical layer. The resulting energy gap became populated with topologically protected one-way modes, which traveled only at the system interface.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Potential applications ==
Plexcitons potentially offer an appealing platform for exploring exotic matter phases and for controlling nanoscale energy flows.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Fronts connecting stable - unstable homogeneous states ==
The most simple example of front solution connecting a homogeneous stable state with a homogeneous unstable state can be shown in the one-dimensional [[Fisher-Kolmogorov equation]]: 

::&lt;math&gt; u_{t} = D u_{xx} + k u (1-u)&lt;/math&gt;

that describes a simple model for the density &lt;math&gt;u(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; of population. This equation has two steady states, &lt;math&gt;u \equiv 0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; u \equiv 1&lt;/math&gt;. This solution corresponds to extinction and saturation of population. Observe that this model is spatially-extended, because it includes a diffusion term given by the second derivative. The state &lt;math&gt;u \equiv 0&lt;/math&gt; is stable as a simple linear analysis can show and the state &lt;math&gt; u \equiv 1&lt;/math&gt; is unstable. There exist a family of front solutions connecting &lt;math&gt;u=1&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;u=0&lt;/math&gt;, and such solution are propagative. Particularly, there exist one solution of the form &lt;math&gt;u(t,x)=u(x-vt)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; constants, depending only on the coefficient of diffusion and growth constant k.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60713">The '''Jahn–Teller effect''' (JT effect or JTE) is an important mechanism of [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] in molecular and solid-state systems which has far-reaching consequences for different fields, and it is related to a variety of applications in [[spectroscopy]], [[stereochemistry]] and [[crystal chemistry]], molecular and [[solid-state physics]], and [[materials science]]. The effect is named for [[Hermann Arthur Jahn]] and [[Edward Teller]], who first reported studies about it in 1937.

==Simplified overview==
The '''Jahn–Teller effect''', sometimes also known as '''Jahn–Teller distortion''', describes the geometrical distortion of [[molecule]]s and [[ion]]s that is associated with certain electron configurations.  The '''Jahn–Teller theorem''' essentially states that any non-linear molecule with a spatially [[degenerate energy level|degenerate]] electronic ground state will undergo a geometrical distortion that removes that degeneracy, because the distortion lowers the overall energy of the species. For a description of another type of geometrical distortion that occurs in crystals with substitutional impurities see article [[off-center ions]].

===Transition metal chemistry===
[[File:Hexaaquacopper(II)-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|220px|The Jahn–Teller effect is responsible for the tetragonal distortion of the hexaaquacopper(II) complex ion, [Cu(OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, which might otherwise possess [[octahedral molecular geometry|octahedral]] geometry.  The two axial Cu−O distances are 238 [[picometre|pm]], whereas the four equatorial Cu−O distances are ~195 pm. This geometry is common in [[crystal structure]]s; the [[Metal ions in aqueous solution#Transition metals and group 12 metals|geometry in solution]] is uncertain.&lt;ref name="Persson"&gt;{{ cite journal | first1 = Ingmar | last1 = Persson | title = Hydrated metal ions in aqueous solution: How regular are their structures? | journal = [[Pure and Applied Chemistry]] | year = 2010 | volume = 82 | issue = 10 | pages = 1901–1917 | doi = 10.1351/PAC-CON-09-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Jahn-Teller effect in octahedral complexes.png|left|thumb|'''Above''': JT effect is observed as tetragonal elongation and compression in octahedral high-spin d&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; complexes due to net change in the energy of electrons (notice odd amount of electrons in e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;-orbital). '''Below''': JT effect doesn't occur if there is no net change in energy (notice even amount of electrons in e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;-orbital).]]
The Jahn–Teller effect is most often encountered in [[octahedral complex]]es of the transition metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Shriver | first1 = D. F. | last2 = Atkins | first2 = P. W. | date = 1999 | title = Inorganic Chemistry | edition = 3rd | pages = 235–236 | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 978-0-19-850330-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The phenomenon is very common in six-coordinate [[copper]](II) complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Metal-ligand bonding | first1 = Rob | last1 = Janes | first2 = Elaine A. | last2 = Moore | publisher = Royal Society of Chemistry | date = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-85404-979-0 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qsP7mmhqvj4C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=%22Jahn-Teller+distortion%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''d''&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; electronic configuration of this [[ion]] gives three electrons in the two degenerate [[crystal field theory|''e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'']] orbitals, leading to a doubly degenerate electronic ground state. Such complexes distort along one of the molecular fourfold axes (always labelled the ''z'' axis), which has the effect of removing the orbital and electronic degeneracies and lowering the overall energy. The distortion normally takes the form of elongating the bonds to the ligands lying along the ''z'' axis, but occasionally occurs as a shortening of these bonds instead (the Jahn–Teller theorem does not predict the direction of the distortion, only the presence of an unstable geometry). When such an elongation occurs, the effect is to lower the electrostatic repulsion between the electron-pair on the [[Lewis base|Lewis basic]] ligand and any electrons in orbitals with a ''z'' component, thus lowering the energy of the complex. The inversion centre is preserved after the distortion.

In octahedral complexes, the Jahn–Teller effect is most pronounced when an odd number of electrons occupy the ''e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' orbitals. This situation arises in complexes with the configurations ''d''&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, [[crystal field theory|low-spin]] ''d''&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; or [[crystal field theory|high-spin]] ''d''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; complexes, all of which have doubly degenerate ground states. In such compounds the ''e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' orbitals involved in the degeneracy point directly at the ligands, so distortion can result in a large energetic stabilisation. Strictly speaking, the effect also occurs when there is a degeneracy due to the electrons in the ''t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt;'' orbitals (''i.e.'' configurations such as ''d''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; or ''d''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, both of which are triply degenerate). In such cases, however, the effect is much less noticeable, because there is a much smaller lowering of repulsion on taking ligands further away from the ''t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt;'' orbitals, which do not point ''directly'' at the ligands (see the table below).  The same is true in tetrahedral complexes (e.g. [[manganate]]: distortion is very subtle because there is less stabilisation to be gained because the ligands are not pointing directly at the orbitals.

The expected effects for octahedral coordination are given in the following table:

The Jahn–Teller effect is manifested in the [[UV/VIS spectroscopy|UV-VIS]] absorbance spectra of some compounds, where it often causes splitting of bands. It is readily apparent in the structures of many copper(II) complexes.&lt;ref name=Frank&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frank | first1 = Patrick | last2 = Benfatto | first2 = Maurizio | last3 = Szilagyi | first3 = Robert K. | last4 = D'Angelo | first4 = Paola | last5 = Della Longa | first5 = Stefano | last6 = Hodgson | first6 = Keith O. | date = 2005 | title = The Solution Structure of [Cu(aq)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Its Implications for Rack-Induced Bonding in Blue Copper Protein Active Sites | url = | journal = [[Inorganic Chemistry (journal)|Inorganic Chemistry]] | volume = 44 | issue = 6| pages = 1922–1933 | doi = 10.1021/ic0400639 | pmid = 15762718 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional, detailed information about the anisotropy of such complexes and the nature of the ligand binding can be however obtained from the fine structure of the low-temperature [[electron spin resonance]] spectra.

===Related effects===
The underlying cause of the Jahn–Teller effect is the presence of [[molecular orbitals]] that are both [[Degenerate energy levels|degenerate]] and [[open shell]] (i.e., incompletely occupied). This situation is not unique to coordination complexes and can be encountered in other areas of chemistry. In organic chemistry the phenomenon of [[antiaromaticity]] has the same cause and also often sees molecules distorting; as in the case of [[cyclobutadiene]]&lt;ref name=Senn&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Senn|first1=Peter|title=A simple quantum mechanical model that illustrates the Jahn–Teller effect|journal=[[Journal of Chemical Education]]|date=October 1992|volume=69|issue=10|pages=819|doi=10.1021/ed069p819|bibcode = 1992JChEd..69..819S }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cyclooctatetraene]] (COT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Frank-Gerrit | last = Klärner | title = About the Antiaromaticity of Planar Cyclooctatetraene | date = 2001 | journal = [[Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English]] | volume = 40 | issue = 21 | pages = 3977–3981 | doi = 10.1002/1521-3773(20011105)40:21&lt;3977::AID-ANIE3977&gt;3.0.CO;2-N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advanced treatment==

===The Jahn–Teller theorem===
The JT theorem can be stated in different forms, two of which are given here:

:"A nonlinear polyatomic system in a spatially degenerate electronic state distorts spontaneously in such a way that the degeneracy is lifted and a new equilibrium structure of lower symmetry is attained."

Alternatively and considerably shorter:
:"... stability and degeneracy are not possible simultaneously unless the molecule is a linear one ...".&lt;ref name="JahnTeller1937"/&gt;

Spin-degeneracy was an exception in the original treatment and was later treated separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last=Bersuker
|first=I. B.
|title=The Jahn–Teller Effect
|publisher=Cambridge University Press
|location=Cambridge
|year=2006
|isbn=9780521822121
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal mathematical proof of the Jahn–Teller theorem rests heavily on symmetry arguments, more specifically the theory of molecular [[point groups]]. The argument of [[Hermann Arthur Jahn|Jahn]] and [[Edward Teller|Teller]] assumes no details about the [[electronic structure]] of the system.  Jahn and Teller made no statement about the strength of the effect, which may be so small that it is immeasurable. Indeed, for electrons in non-bonding or weakly bonding [[molecular orbitals]], the effect is expected to be weak. However, in many situations the JT effect is important.

===Historic developments===
Interest in the JTE increased after its first experimental verification. Various model systems were developed probing the degree of [[Degenerate energy level|degeneracy]] and the type of symmetry.&lt;ref name=Bates1978&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were solved partly analytically and partly numerically to obtain the shape of the pertinent [[potential energy surface]]s (PES) and the energy levels for the nuclear motion on the JT-split PES. These energy levels are not [[Molecular vibration|vibrational]] energy levels in the traditional sense because of the intricate coupling to the electronic motion that occurs, and are better termed [[vibronic]] energy levels. The new field of ‘[[vibronic coupling]]’ or ‘vibronic coupling theory’ was born.

A further breakthrough occurred upon the advent of modern ("[[ab initio]]") [[electronic structure]] calculations whereby the relevant parameters characterising JT systems can be reliably determined from first principles. Thus one could go beyond studies of model systems that explore the effect of parameter variations on the PES and [[Vibronic coupling|vibronic]] energy levels; one could also go on beyond fitting these parameters to experimental data without clear knowledge about the significance of the fit. Instead, well-founded theoretical investigations became possible which greatly improved the insight into the phenomena at hand and into the details of the underlying mechanisms.

[[File:Jahn-Teller and pseudo Jahn-Teller effects.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|A conceptual comparison of the Jahn–Teller and pseudo Jahn–Teller effects, showing the mutual relation of two potential energy surfaces (PES) in the two cases. The number of PES is two in this picture but it can be more in actual molecular or solid-state systems.]]
While recognizing the JTE distortion as a concrete example of the general [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] mechanism, the exact degeneracy of the involved electronic state was identified as a non-essential ingredient for this [[symmetry breaking]] in polyatomic systems. Even systems that in the undistorted symmetric configuration present electronic states which are near in energy but not precisely degenerate, can show a similar tendency to distort. The distortions of these systems can be treated within the related theory of the [[pseudo Jahn–Teller effect]] (in the literature often referred to as "second-order JTE"). This mechanism is associated to the vibronic couplings between adiabatic PES separated by nonzero energy gaps across the configuration space: its inclusion extends the applicability of JT-related models to symmetry breaking in a far broader range of molecular and solid-state systems.

*[[Peierls transition|Peierls theorem]], which states that a one-dimensional equally-spaced chain of ions with one electron per ion is unstable, has common roots with the JT effect.

==Theory==

===Symmetry of JT systems and categorisation using group theory===
A given JT problem will have a particular [[point group symmetry]], such as [[Tetrahedral symmetry|T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry]] for magnetic impurity ions in [[semiconductors]] or [[Icosahedral symmetry|I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry]] for the [[Buckminsterfullerene|fullerene C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]]. JT problems are conventionally classified using labels for the [[irreducible representations]] (irreps) that apply to the symmetry of the electronic and vibrational states. For example, E ⊗ e would refer to an electronic doublet state transforming as E coupled to a vibrational doublet state transforming as e.

In general, a vibrational mode transforming as Λ will couple to an electronic state transforming as Γ if the symmetric part of the [[Kronecker product]] [Γ ⊗ Γ]&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; contains Λ, unless Γ is a [[double group]] representation when the antisymmetric part {Γ ⊗ Γ}&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is considered instead. Modes which do couple are said to be JT-active.

As an example, consider a doublet electronic state E in cubic symmetry. The symmetric part of E ⊗ E is A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + E. Therefore, the state E will couple to vibrational modes &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; transforming as a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and e. However, the a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; modes will result in the same energy shift to all states and therefore do not contribute to any JT splitting. They can therefore be neglected. The result is an E ⊗ e JT effect. This JT effect is experienced by triangular molecules X&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, tetrahedral molecules ML&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and octahedral molecules ML&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; when their electronic state has E symmetry.

Components of a given vibrational mode are also labelled according to their transformation properties. For example, the two components of an e mode are usually labelled &lt;math&gt;Q_\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, which in [[octahedral symmetry]] transform as &lt;math&gt;3z^2-r^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^2-y^2&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

===The JT Hamiltonian===

Eigenvalues of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] of a polyatomic system define PESs as functions of normal modes &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; of the system (i.e. linear combinations of the nuclear displacements with specific symmetry properties {{Crossreference|selfref=no|(see [[#Symmetry and Group Theory]])}}. At the reference point of high symmetry, where the symmetry-induced degeneracy occurs, several of the eigenvalues coincide. By a detailed and laborious analysis, [[Hermann Arthur Jahn|Jahn]] and [[Edward Teller|Teller]] showed that – excepting linear molecules – there are always first-order terms in an expansion of the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian in terms of symmetry-lowering (in the language of [[group theory]]: non-totally symmetric) normal modes. These linear terms represent forces that distort the system along these coordinates and lift the degeneracy. The point of degeneracy can thus not be stationary, and the system distorts toward a stationary point of lower symmetry where stability can be attained.

Proof of the JT theorem follows from the theory of molecular symmetry ([[point group]] theory). A less rigorous but more intuitive explanation is given in section {{Crossreference|selfref=no|[[#Coordination Chemistry]]}}.

To arrive at a quantitative description of the JT effect, the forces appearing between the component [[wave functions]] are described by expanding the Hamiltonian in a power series in the &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt;. Owing to the very nature of the degeneracy, the Hamiltonian takes the form of a matrix referring to the degenerate [[wave function]] components. A [[Matrix element (physics)|matrix element]] between states &lt;math&gt;\Psi_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Psi_b&lt;/math&gt; generally reads as:

:&lt;math&gt;H_{ab}=&lt;\Psi_a|H|\Psi_b&gt;=&lt;\Psi_a|H(Q_i=0)+\sum_{i}\frac{\partial V}{\partial Q_i} Q_i + ...|\Psi_b&gt;&lt;/math&gt;

The expansion can be truncated after terms linear in the &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt;, or extended to include terms quadratic (or higher) in the &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Adiabatic process#Divergent usages of the word adiabatic|adiabatic]] [[potential energy surface]]s (APES) are then obtained as the [[eigenvalues]] of this matrix. In the original paper it is proven that there are always linear terms in the expansion. It follows that the degeneracy of the [[wave function]] cannot correspond to a stable structure.

===Potential energy surfaces===

====Mexican-hat potential====
In mathematical terms, the APESs characterising the JT distortion arise as the [[eigenvalues]] of the potential energy matrix (as described in {{Crossreference|selfref=no|[[#Symmetry and Group Theory]]}}). Generally, the APESs take the characteristic appearance of a double cone, circular or elliptic, where the point of contact, i.e. degeneracy, denotes the high-symmetry configuration for which the JT theorem applies. For the above case of the linear E ⊗ e JT effect the situation is illustrated by the APES

:&lt;math&gt;V=\frac{\mu\omega^2}{2}(Q_\theta^2 + Q_\epsilon^2) \pm k \sqrt{Q_\theta^2 + Q_\epsilon^2}&lt;/math&gt;

displayed in the figure, with part cut away to reveal its shape, which is known as a Mexican Hat potential. Here, &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency of the vibrational e mode, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is its mass and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a measure of the strength of the JT coupling. [[File:E x e potential energy surfaces.jpg|thumb|The potential energy surfaces of an E ⊗ e Jahn–Teller effect]]

The conical shape near the degeneracy at the origin makes it immediately clear that this point cannot be [[Stationary point|stationary]], that is, the system is unstable against asymmetric distortions, which leads to a symmetry lowering. In this particular case there are infinitely many isoenergetic JT distortions. The &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; giving these distortions are arranged in a circle, as shown by the red curve in the figure. Quadratic coupling or cubic elastic terms lead to a warping along this "minimum energy path", replacing this infinite manifold by three equivalent potential minima and three equivalent saddle points. In other JT systems, linear coupling results in discrete minima.

====Conical intersections====
The high symmetry of the double-cone topology of the linear E ⊗ e JT system directly reflects the high underlying symmetry. It is one of the earliest (if not the earliest) examples in the literature of a [[conical intersection]] of potential energy surfaces. Conical intersections have received wide attention in the literature starting in the 1990s and are now considered paradigms of nonadiabatic excited-state dynamics, with far-reaching consequences in molecular spectroscopy, [[photochemistry]] and photophysics. Some of these will be commented upon further below. In general, [[conical intersection]]s are far less symmetric than depicted in the figure. They can be tilted and elliptical in shape etc., and also peaked and sloped intersections have been distinguished in the literature. Furthermore, for more than two degrees of freedom, they are not point-like structures but instead they are seams and complicated, curved hypersurfaces, also known as intersection space. The coordinate sub-space displayed in the figure is also known as a branching plane.

====Implications for dynamics====
The characteristic shape of the JT-split APES has specific consequences for the nuclear dynamics, here considered in the fully quantum sense. For sufficiently strong JT coupling, the minimum points are sufficiently far (at least by a few vibrational energy quanta) below the JT intersection. Two different energy regimes are then to be distinguished, those of low and high energy.

* In the low-energy regime the nuclear motion is confined to regions near the "minimum energy points". The distorted configurations sampled impart their geometrical parameters on, for example, the rotational fine structure in a spectrum. Due to the existence of barriers between the various minima in the APES, like those appearing due to the warping of the {{Crossreference|selfref=no|(see [[#Mexican Hat potential]])}}, motion on the low-energy regime is usually classified as either a static JTE, dynamic JTE or incoherent hopping. Each regime shows particular fingerprints on experimental measurements.

:* '''Static JTE''': In this case, the system is trapped in one of the lowest-energy minima of the APES (usually determined by small perturbations created by the environment of the JT system) and does not have enough energy to cross the barrier towards another minimum during the typical time associated to the measurement. Quantum dynamical effects like tunnelling are negligible, and effectively the molecule or solid displays the low symmetry associated with a single minimum.

:* '''Dynamic JTE''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|doi=10.1021/j100796a043
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the barriers are sufficiently small compared to, for example, the zero-point energy associated to the minima, so that vibronic wavefunctions (and all observables) display the symmetry of the reference (undistorted) system. In the linear E ⊗ e problem, the motion associated to this regime would be around the circular path in the figure. When the barrier is sufficiently small, this is called (free) pseudorotation (not to be confused with the rotation of a rigid body in space, see difference between real and pseudo rotations illustrated [http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/~ppzjld/pseudorotate.htm here] for the [[Buckminsterfullerene|fullerene molecule]] C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;). When the barrier between the minima and the saddle points on the warped path exceeds a vibrational quantum, pseudorotational motion is slowed down and occurs through tunnelling. This is called hindered pseudorotation. In both free and hindered pseudorotation, the important phenomenon of the geometric (Berry) phase alters the ordering of the levels.

:* '''Incoherent hopping''': Another way in which the system can overcome the barrier is through thermal energy. In this case, while the system moves throughout the minima of the system, the state is not a quantum coherent one but a statistical mixture. This difference can be observed experimentally.

* The dynamics is quite different for high energies, such as occur from an optical transition from a non-degenerate initial state with a high-symmetry (JT undistorted) equilibrium geometry into a JT distorted state. This leads the system to the region near the conical intersection of the JT-split APES in the centre of the figure. Here the nonadiabatic couplings become very large and the behaviour of the system cannot be described within the familiar [[Born-Oppenheimer approximation|Born-Oppenheimer]] (BO) separation between the electronic and nuclear motions. The nuclear motion ceases to be confined to a single, well-defined APES and the transitions between the adiabatic surfaces occur yielding effects like Slonzcewsky resonances. In molecules this is usually a femtosecond timescale, which amounts to ultrafast (femtosecond) internal conversion processes, accompanied by broad spectral bands also under isolated-molecule conditions and highly complex spectral features. Examples for these phenomena will be covered in Section {{Crossreference|selfref=no|[[#Spectroscopy and Reactivity]]}}.

As already stated above, the distinction of low and high energy regimes is valid only for sufficiently strong JT couplings, that is, when several or many vibrational energy quanta fit into the energy window between the conical intersection and the minimum of the lower JT-split APES. For the many cases of small to intermediate JT couplings this energy window and the corresponding adiabatic low-energy regime does not exist. Rather, the levels on both JT-split APES are intricately mixed for all energies and the nuclear motion always proceeds on both JT split APES simultaneously.

===Ham factors===
In 1965, Frank Ham &lt;ref name=Ham1965 /&gt; proposed that the dynamic JTE could reduce the expected values of observables associated with the orbital wavefunctions due to the superposition of several electronic states in the total vibronic wavefunction. This effect leads, for example, to a partial quenching of the spin-orbit interaction&lt;ref name=Ham1965 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and allowed the results of previous [[Electron Paramagnetic Resonance]] (EPR) experiments to be explained.

In general, the result of an orbital operator acting on vibronic states can be replaced by an effective orbital operator acting on purely electronic states. In first order, the effective orbital operator equals the actual orbital operator multiplied by a constant, whose value is less than one, known as a first-order (Ham) reduction factor. For example, within a triplet T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; electronic state, the spin-orbit coupling operator &lt;math&gt;\lambda \mathbf{L}.\mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt; can be replaced by &lt;math&gt;\gamma \lambda \mathbf{L}.\mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a function of the strength of the JT coupling which varies from 1 in zero coupling to 0 in very strong coupling. Furthermore, when second-order perturbation corrections are included, additional terms are introduced involving additional numerical factors, known as second-order (Ham) reduction factors. These factors are zero when there is no JT coupling but can dominate over first-order terms in strong coupling, when the first-order effects have been significantly reduced.&lt;ref name=Bates1978 /&gt;
 
Reduction factors are particularly useful for describing experimental results, such as [[Electron paramagnetic resonance|EPR]] and optical spectra, of [[paramagnetic]] impurities in [[semiconducting]], [[dielectric]], [[diamagnetic]] and [[ferrimagnetic]] hosts.

===Modern developments===
For a long time, applications of JT theory consisted mainly in parameter studies (model studies) where the APES and dynamical properties of JT systems have been investigated as functions on the system parameters such as coupling constants etc. Fits of these parameters to experimental data were often doubtful and inconclusive. The situation changed in the 1980s when efficient ab initio methods were developed and computational resources became powerful enough to allow for a reliable determination of these parameters from first principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yates | first1 = JH | last2 = Pitzer | first2 = RM | date =1979 | title = Molecular and Electronic Structures of Transition Metal Trifluorides | journal = J. Chem. Phys. | volume = 70 | issue = 9 | pages = 4049-4055 | doi = 10.1063/1.438027 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from [[wave function]]-based 
techniques (which are sometimes considered genuinely [[ab initio]] in the literature) the advent of [[density functional theory]] (DFT) opened up new avenues to treat larger systems including solids. This allowed details of JT systems to be characterised and experimental findings to be reliably interpreted. It lies at the heart of most developments addressed in Section {{Crossreference|selfref=no|[[#Applications]]}}.

Two different strategies are conceivable and have been used in the literature. One can

#take the applicability of a certain coupling scheme for granted and limit oneself to determine the parameters of the model, for example from the energy gain achieved through the JT distortion, also termed JT stabilisation energy.
#map parts of the APES in whole or reduced dimensionality and thus get an insight into the applicability of the model, possibly also deriving ideas how to extend it.

Naturally, the more accurate approach (2) may be limited to smaller systems, while the simpler approach (1) lends itself to studies of larger systems.

==Applications==

===Effects on structure===

====Small molecules and ions====
The JT distortion of small molecules (or molecular ions) is directly deduced from electronic structure calculations of their APES (through [[Density functional theory|DFT]] and/or ab initio computations). These molecules / ions are often radicals, such as trimers of alkali atoms (Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), that have unpaired spins and in particular in (but not restricted to) doublet states. Besides the JTE in &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;E' and &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;E" states, also the {{Crossreference|selfref=no|[[Pseudo Jahn-Teller effect|pseudo JTE]]}} between an E state and a nearby A state may play a role. The JT distortion reduces the symmetry from D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; (see figure), and it depends on the details of the interactions whether the isosceles triangle has an acute or an obtuse-angled (such as Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) minimum energy structure. Natural extensions are systems like NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; where a JT distortion has been documented in the literature for ground or excited electronic states. 
[[File:Jahn-Teller distortions of a triangle.jpg|thumb|Two possible ways in which an equilateral triangle could distort due to a Jahn–Teller effect.]]

A somewhat special role is played by tetrahedral systems like CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Here threefold degenerate electronic states and vibrational modes come into play. Nevertheless, also twofold degeneracies continue to be important.

Among larger systems, a focus in the literature has been on benzene and its radical cation, as well as on their halo (especially fluoro) derivatives. Already in the early 1980s, a wealth of information emerged from the detailed analysis of experimental emission spectra of 1,3,5- trifluoro- and hexafluoro (and chloro) benzene radical cations. For the parent benzene cation one has to rely on photoelectron spectra with comparatively lower resolution because this species does not fluoresce (see also Section on {{Crossreference|selfref=no|[[#Spectroscopy and Reactivity|Spectroscopy and Reactivity]]}}). Rather detailed ab initio calculations have been carried out which 
document the JT stabilization energies for the various (four) JT active modes and also quantify the moderate barriers for the JT pseudorotation.

Finally, a somewhat special role is played by systems with a fivefold symmetry axis like the cyclopentadienyl radical. Careful laser spectroscopic investigations have shed useful light on the JT interactions. In particular they reveal that the barrier to pseudorotation almost vanishes (the system is highly "fluxional") which can be attributed to the fact that the 2nd-order coupling terms vanish by symmetry and the leading higher-order terms are of 4th order.

====Coordination chemistry====
The JTE is usually stronger where the electron density associated with the degenerate orbitals is more concentrated. This effect therefore plays a large role in determining  the structure of transition metal complexes with active internal 3d orbitals. [[File:D orbitals in an octahedron.jpg|thumb|Images of d orbitals transforming as &lt;math&gt;3z^2-r^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^2-y^2&lt;/math&gt; embedded in an octahedron]][[File:Dlevels.png|thumb|Effect of a JT distortion on d orbitals]]

The most iconic and prominent of the JT systems in coordination chemistry is probably the case of Cu(II) octahedral complexes. While in perfectly equivalent coordination, like a CuF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; complex associated to a Cu(II) impurity in a cubic crystal like KMgF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, perfect octahedral (O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) symmetry is expected.  In fact a lower tetragonal symmetry is usually found experimentally. The origin of this JTE distortion it revealed by examining the electronic configuration of the undistorted complex. For an octahedral geometry, the five 3d orbitals partition into t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; and e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals (see diagram).  These orbitals are occupied by nine electrons corresponding to the &lt;math&gt;d^9&lt;/math&gt; electronic configuration of Cu(II). Thus, the t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; shell is filled, and the e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; shell contains 3 electrons. Overall the unpaired electron produces a &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; state, which is Jahn–Teller active.  The third electron can occupy either of the orbitals comprising the e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; shell: the mainly &lt;math&gt;3z^2-r^2&lt;/math&gt; orbital or the mainly &lt;math&gt;x^2-y^2&lt;/math&gt; orbital.   If the electron occupies the mainly &lt;math&gt;3z^2-r^2&lt;/math&gt; level, which antibonding orbital the final geometry of the complex would be elongated as the axial ligands will be pushed away to reduce the global energy of the system. On the other hand, if the electron went into the mainly &lt;math&gt;x^2-y^2&lt;/math&gt; antibonding orbital the complex would distort into a compressed geometry. Experimentally elongated geometries are overwhelmingly observed and this fact has been attributed both to metal-ligand anharmonic interactions &lt;ref name=Opik1957 /&gt; and 3d-4s hybridisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|doi=10.1021/ic00228a031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that all the directions containing a fourfold axis are equivalent the distortion is equally likely to happen in any of these orientations. From the electronic point of view this means that the &lt;math&gt;3z^2-r^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^2-y^2&lt;/math&gt; orbitals, that are degenerate and free to hybridise in the octahedral geometry, will mix to produce appropriate equivalent orbitals in each direction like &lt;math&gt;3x^2-r^2&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;3y^2-r^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The JTE is not just restricted to Cu(II) octahedral complexes. There are many other configurations, involving changes both in the initial structure and electronic configuration of the metal that yield degenerate states and, thus, JTE. However, the amount of distortion and stabilisation energy of the effect is strongly dependent on the particular case. In octahedral Cu(II), the JTE is particularly strong because

# the degenerate orbitals display a strongly antibonding σ character 
# Cu is a transition metal with a relatively strong [[electronegativity]] yielding more covalent bonds than other metals which allows to increase the JT linear coupling constant.

In other configurations involving π or δ bonding, like for example when the degenerate state is associated to the t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals of an octahedral configuration, the distortion and stabilisation energies are usually much smaller and the possibility of not observing the distortion due to dynamic JT effects is much higher. Similarly for rare-earth ions where covalency is very small, the distortions associated to the JTE are usually very weak.

Importantly, the JTE is associated with strict degeneracy in the electronic subsystem and so it cannot appear in systems without this property. For example, the JTE is often associated to cases like quasi-octahedral CuX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Y&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; complexes where the distances to X and Y [[ligands]] are clearly different. However, the intrinsic symmetry of these complexes is already tetragonal and no degenerate e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; orbital exists, having split into a&lt;sub&gt;1g&lt;/sub&gt; (mainly &lt;math&gt;3z^2-r^2&lt;/math&gt;) and b&lt;sub&gt;1g&lt;/sub&gt; (mainly &lt;math&gt;x^2-y^2&lt;/math&gt;) orbitals due to the different electronic interactions with axial X [[ligands]] and equatorial Y [[ligands]]. In this and other similar cases some remaining vibronic effects related to the JTE are still present but are quenched with respect to the case with degeneracy due to the splitting of the orbitals.

===Spectroscopy and reactivity===
From spectra with rotational resolution, moments of inertia and hence bond lengths and angles can be determined "directly" (at least in principle). From less well-resolved spectra one can still determine important quantities like JT stabilization energies and energy barriers (e.g. to pseudorotation). However, in the whole spectral intensity distribution &lt;math&gt;P(E)&lt;/math&gt; of an electronic transition more information is encoded. It has been used to decide on the presence (or absence) of the geometric phase which is accumulated during the pseudorotational motion around the JT (or other type of) conical intersection. Prominent examples of either type are the ground (X) or an excited (B) state of Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The Fourier transform of &lt;math&gt;P(E)&lt;/math&gt;, the so-called autocorrelation function &lt;math&gt;C(t)&lt;/math&gt; reflects the motion of the wavepacket after an optical (= vertical) transition to the APES of the final electronic state. Typically it will move on the timescale of a vibrational period which is (for small molecules) of the order of 5-50 fs, i.e. ultrafast. Besides a nearly periodic motion, mode-mode interactions with very irregular (also chaotic) behaviour and spreading of the wavepacket may also occur. Near a conical intersection this will be accompanied/complemented by nonradiative transitions (termed internal conversion) to other APESs occurring on the same ultrafast time scale.

For the JT case the situation is somewhat special, as compared to a general conical intersection, because the different JT potential sheets are symmetry-related to each other and have (exactly or nearly) the same energy minimum. The "transition" between them is thus more oscillatory than one would normally expect, and their time-averaged populations are close to 1/2. For a more typical scenario a more general conical intersection is "required".

The JT effect still comes into play, namely in combination with a different nearby, in general non-degenerate electronic state.  The result is a [[pseudo Jahn–Teller effect]], for example, of an E state interacting with an A state. This situation is common in JT systems, just as interactions between two nondegenerate electronic states are common for  non-JT systems. Examples are excited electronic states of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and the benzene radical cation. Here, crossings between the E and A state APESs amount to triple intersections, which are associated with very complex spectral features (dense line structures and diffuse spectral envelopes under low resolution). The population transfer between the states is also ultrafast, so fast that fluorescence (proceeding on a nanosecond time scale) cannot compete. This helps to understand why the benzene cation, like many other organic radical cation, does not fluoresce.

To be sure, photochemical reactivity emerges when the internal conversion makes the system explore the nuclear configuration space such that new chemical species are formed. There is a plethora of femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopic techniques to reveal details of these processes occurring, for example, in the process of vision.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
free electrons in a solid, introduced for example by doping or irradiation, can interact with the vibrations of the lattice to form a localized quasi-particle known as a [[polaron]]. Strongly localized polarons (also called Holstein polarons) can condensate around high-symmetry sites of the lattice with electrons or holes occupying local degenerate orbitals that experience the JTE. These Jahn–Teller polarons break both translational and point group symmetries of the lattice where they are found and have been attributed important roles in effects like [[colossal magnetoresistance]] and [[superconductivity]].

[[Paramagnetic]] impurities in [[semiconducting]], [[dielectric]], [[diamagnetic]] and [[ferrimagnetic]] hosts can all be described using a JT model. For example, these models were used extensively in the 1980s and 1990s to describe ions of Cr, V and Ti substituting for Ga in GaAs and GaP.

JT effects both within the C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; molecules (intramolecular) and between C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; molecules (intermolecular) play a part in the mechanisms behind various observed properties in these systems. For example, they could mean that the Migdal-Eliashberg treatment of [[superconductivity]] breaks down. Also, the fullerides can form a so-called new state of matter known as a Jahn–Teller metal, where localised electrons coexist with [[metallicity]] and JT distortions on the C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; molecules persist &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

====Cooperative JT effect in crystals====
The JTE is usually associated with degeneracies that are well localised in space, like those occurring in a small molecule or associated to an isolated transition metal complex. However, in many periodic high-symmetry solid-state systems, like perovskites, some crystalline sites allow for electronic degeneracy giving rise under adequate compositions to lattices of JT-active centers. This can produce a cooperative JTE, where global distortions of the crystal occur due to local degeneracies.

In order to determine the final electronic and geometric structure of a cooperative JT system, it is necessary to take into account both the local distortions and the interaction between the different sites, which will take such form necessary to minimise the global energy of the crystal.

While works on the cooperative JTE started in the late fifties

}}&lt;/ref&gt; can lead to structural [[phase transitions]].

It is important to note that many cooperative JT systems would be expected to be metals from band theory as, to produce them, a degenerate orbital has to be partially filled and the associated band would be metallic. However, under the perturbation of the symmetry-breaking distortion associated to the cooperative JTE, the degeneracies in the electronic structure are destroyed and the ground state of these systems is often found to be insulating (see e.g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In many important cases like the parent compound for [[colossal magnetoresistance]] perovskites, LaMnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, an increase of temperature leads to disorder in the distortions which lowers the band splitting due to the cooperative JTE, thus triggering a metal-insulator transition.

==== JT-related effects: Orbital ordering ====
In modern solid-state physics, it is common to classify systems according to the kind of degrees of freedom they have available, like electron (metals) or spin (magnetism). In crystals that can display the JTE, and before this effect is realised by symmetry-breaking distortions, it is found that there exists an orbital degree of freedom consisting of how electrons occupy the local degenerate orbitals. As initially discussed by Kugel and Khomskii,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|year=1982

|pages=231–256
|doi=10.3367/UFNr.0136.198204c.0621
}}&lt;/ref&gt; not all configurations are equivalent. The key is the relative orientation of these occupied orbital, in the same way that spin orientation is important in magnetic systems, and the ground state can only be realised for some particular orbital pattern. Both this pattern and the effect giving rise to this phenomenon is usually denominated orbital-ordering.

In order to predict the orbital-ordering pattern, Kugel and Khomskii used a particularisation of the [[Hubbard model]]. In particular they established how [[superexchange]] interactions, usually described by the Anderson–Kanamori–Goodenough rules, change in the presence of degenerate orbitals. Their model, using a pseudospin representation for the local orbitals, leads to a [[Heisenberg model (quantum)|Heisenberg-like model]] in which the ground state is a combination of orbital and spin patterns. Using this model it can be shown, for example, that the origin of the unusual ground insulating [[ferromagnetic]] state of a solid like K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; can be traced to its orbital ordering.

Even when starting from a relatively high-symmetry structure the combined effect of exchange interactions, spin-orbit coupling, orbital-ordering and crystal deformations activated by the JTE can lead to very low symmetry magnetic patterns with specific properties. For example, in CsCuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; an incommensurable helicoidal pattern appears both for the orbitals and the distortions along the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis. Moreover, many of these compounds show complex phase diagrams when varying temperature or pressure.

'''Solid-state physics''' is the study of rigid [[matter]], or [[solid]]s, through methods such as [[quantum mechanics]], [[crystallography]], [[electromagnetism]], and [[metallurgy]].  It is the largest branch of [[condensed matter physics]]. Solid-state physics studies how the large-scale properties of solid materials result from their [[atom]]ic-scale properties.   Thus,  solid-state physics forms a theoretical basis of [[materials science]].  It also has direct applications, for example in the technology of [[transistor]]s and [[semiconductor]]s.

== Background ==
Solid materials are formed from densely packed atoms, which interact intensely.  These interactions produce the mechanical (e.g. [[hardness]] and [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]), [[Heat conduction|thermal]], [[Electrical conduction|electrical]], [[Magnetism|magnetic]] and [[Crystal optics|optical]] properties of solids.  Depending on the material involved and the conditions in which it was formed, the atoms may be arranged in a regular, geometric pattern ([[crystal|crystalline solids]], which include [[metal]]s and ordinary [[Ice|water ice]]) or irregularly (an [[amorphous solid]] such as common window [[glass]]).

The bulk of solid-state physics, as a general theory, is focused on [[crystal]]s.  Primarily,  this is  because the periodicity of [[atom]]s in a crystal — its defining characteristic — facilitates mathematical modeling.  Likewise, crystalline materials often have [[electrical engineering|electrical]], [[magnetism|magnetic]], [[optics|optical]], or [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]] properties that can be exploited for [[engineering]] purposes.

The forces between the atoms in a crystal can take a variety of forms.  For example, in a crystal of [[sodium chloride]] (common salt), the crystal is made up of [[ion]]ic [[sodium]] and [[chlorine]], and held together with [[ionic bond]]s.  In others, the atoms share [[electron]]s and form [[covalent bond]]s.  In metals, electrons are shared amongst the whole crystal in [[metallic bond]]ing.  Finally, the noble gases do not undergo any of these types of bonding.  In solid form, the noble gases are held together with [[van der Waals force]]s resulting from the polarisation of the electronic charge cloud on each atom.  The differences between the types of solid result from the differences between their bonding.

== History ==
The physical properties of solids have been common subjects of scientific inquiry for centuries, but a separate field going by the name of solid-state physics did not emerge until the 1940s, in particular with the establishment of the Division of Solid State Physics (DSSP) within the [[American Physical Society]]. The DSSP catered to industrial physicists, and solid-state physics became associated with the technological applications made possible by research on solids. By the early 1960s, the DSSP was the largest division of the American Physical Society.&lt;ref name=martin-pip&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Joseph D. |title=What's in a Name Change?

Large communities of solid state physicists also emerged in Europe after World War II, in particular in England, Germany, and the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=hoffmann-pss&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoffmann|first=Dieter|title=Fifty Years of ''Physica Status Solidi'' in Historical Perspective|journal=Physica Status Solidi B|date=2013|volume=250|issue=4|doi=10.1002/pssb.201340126|pages=871–887|bibcode=2013PSSBR.250..871H}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States and Europe, solid state became a prominent field through its investigations into semiconductors, superconductivity, nuclear magnetic resonance, and diverse other phenomena. During the early Cold War, research in solid state physics was often not restricted to solids, which led some physicists in the 1970s and 1980s to found the field of [[condensed matter physics]], which organized around common techniques used to investigate solids, liquids, plasmas, and other complex matter.&lt;ref name="martin-pip"/&gt; Today, solid-state physics is broadly considered to be the subfield of condensed matter physics that focuses on the properties of solids with regular crystal lattices.

== Crystal structure and properties ==
[[File:Fcc lattice 4.jpg|190px|thumb|An example of a simple [[cubic crystal system|cubic lattice]]]]
Many properties of materials are affected by their [[crystal structure]].  This structure can be investigated using a range of [[Crystallography|crystallographic]] techniques, including [[X-ray crystallography]], [[neutron diffraction]] and [[electron diffraction]].

The sizes of the individual crystals in a crystalline solid material vary depending on the material involved and the conditions when it was formed.  Most crystalline materials encountered in everyday life are [[polycrystal]]line, with the individual crystals being microscopic in scale, but macroscopic [[single crystal]]s can be produced either naturally (e.g. [[diamond]]s) or artificially.

Real crystals feature [[Crystallographic defect|defects]] or irregularities in the ideal arrangements, and it is these defects that critically determine many of the electrical and mechanical properties of real materials.

== Electronic properties ==
Properties of materials such as [[electrical conduction]] and [[heat capacity]] are investigated by solid state physics.  An early model of electrical conduction was the [[Drude model]], which applied [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] to the [[electron]]s in a solid. By assuming that the material contains immobile positive ions and an "electron gas" of classical, non-interacting electrons, the Drude model was able to explain electrical and [[thermal conductivity]] and the [[Hall effect]] in metals, although it greatly overestimated the electronic heat capacity.

[[Arnold Sommerfeld]] combined the classical Drude model with [[quantum mechanics]] in the [[free electron model]] (or Drude-Sommerfeld model).  Here, the electrons are modelled as a [[Fermi gas]], a gas of particles which obey the quantum mechanical [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]].  The free electron model gave improved predictions for the heat capacity of metals, however, it was unable to explain the existence of [[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]].

The [[nearly free electron model]] is a modification of the free electron model which includes a weak periodic [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation]] meant to model the interaction between the conduction electrons and the ions in a crystalline solid.  By introducing the idea of [[Electronic band structure|electronic bands]], the theory explains the existence of [[electrical conductor|conductors]], [[semiconductor]]s and insulators.

The nearly free electron model rewrites the [[Schrödinger equation]] for the case of a periodic [[potential]].  The solutions in this case are known as [[Bloch wave|Bloch states]].  Since Bloch's theorem applies only to periodic potentials, and since unceasing random movements of atoms in a crystal disrupt periodicity, this use of Bloch's theorem is only an approximation, but it has proven to be a tremendously valuable approximation, without which most solid-state physics analysis would be intractable. Deviations from periodicity are treated by quantum mechanical [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]].

SiNWs have unique properties that are not seen in bulk (three-dimensional) silicon materials. These properties arise from an unusual quasi one-dimensional electronic structure and are the subject of research across numerous disciplines and applications. The reason that SiNWs are considered as one of the most important one-dimensional materials is they could have a function as building blocks for nanoscale electronics assembled without the need for complex and costly fabrication facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yi|first=Cui|last2=Charles M.|first2=Lieber|year=2001|title=Functional Nanoscale Electronic Devices Assembled Using Silicon Nanowire Building Blocks|url=|journal=Science|volume=291|issue=5505|pages=851–853|doi=10.1126/science.291.5505.851|pmid=11157160|via=|bibcode=2001Sci...291..851C}}&lt;/ref&gt; SiNWs are frequently studied towards applications including [[photovoltaics]], [[nanowire batteries]], [[thermoelectrics]] and non-volatile memory.&lt;ref name="miko"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Mikolajick | first1=Thomas | last2= Heinzig |first2= Andre |last3= Trommer | first3= Jens | display-authors= etal  |title= Silicon nanowires–a versatile technology platform | journal= Physica Status Solidi RRL  | year= 2013| volume=7 |issue=10 | pages= 793–799 | doi=10.1002/pssr.201307247|bibcode=2013PSSRR...7..793M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

Owing to their unique physical and chemical properties, silicon nanowires are a promising candidate for a wide range of applications that draw on their unique physico-chemical characteristics, which differ from those of bulk [[silicon]] material.&lt;ref name="slo" /&gt;

SiNWs exhibit charge trapping behavior which renders such systems of value in applications necessitating electron hole separation such as photovoltaics, and photocatalysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Tsakalakos | first1= L. | last2= Balch |first2= J. |last3= Fronheiser | first3= J. | last4= Korevaar | first4=B.|title= Silicon nanowire solar cells | journal= Applied Physics Letters | year= 2007| volume= 91 |issue= 23 | pages= 233117 | doi=10.1063/1.2821113|bibcode= 2007ApPhL..91w3117T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent experiment on nanowire solar cells has led to a remarkable improvement of the power conversion efficiency of SiNW solar cells from &lt;1% to &gt;17% in the last few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yu|first=Peng|last2=Wu|first2=Jiang|last3=Liu|first3=Shenting|last4=Xiong|first4=Jie|last5=Jagadish|first5=Chennupati|last6=Wang|first6=Zhiming M.|date=2016-12-01|title=Design and fabrication of silicon nanowires towards efficient solar cells|journal=Nano Today|volume=11|issue=6|pages=704–737|doi=10.1016/j.nantod.2016.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charge trapping behaviour and tuneable surface governed transport properties of SiNWs render this category of nanostructures of interest towards use as metal insulator semiconductors and [[MOSFET|field effect transistors]], with further applications as nanoelectronic storage devices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Tian | first1=Bozhi | last2= Xiaolin |first2= Zheng|display-authors= etal  |title= Coaxial silicon nanowires as solar cells and nanoelectronic power sources | journal= Nature| year= 2007 | volume= 449 |issue= 7164| pages= 885–889 | doi=10.1038/nature06181| pmid=17943126 |bibcode= 2007Natur.449..885T}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[flash memory]], [[Programmable logic device|logic devices]] as well as chemical and biological [[sensors]].&lt;ref name="miko" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Daniel | first1=Shir | display-authors=etal  |title= Oxidation of silicon nanowires | journal= Journal of Vacuum Science &amp; Technology | year= 2006 | volume= 24 |issue= 3 | pages= 1333–1336 | doi= 10.1116/1.2198847 | bibcode=2006JVSTB..24.1333S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability for [[lithium]] ions to [[Intercalation (chemistry)|intercalate]] into silicon structures renders various Si [[nanostructures]] of interest towards applications as [[anodes]] in [[Lithium-ion battery|Li-ion batteries (LiBs)]]. SiNWs are of particular merit as such anodes as they exhibit the ability to undergo significant lithiation while maintaining structural integrity and electrical connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Chan | first1= C.| last2= Peng |first2= H. |display-authors= etal |title= High-performance lithium battery anodes using silicon nanowires | journal= Nature Nanotechnology | year= 2008| volume= 3|issue= 1| pages= 31–35 | doi=10.1038/nnano.2007.411| pmid= 18654447|bibcode= 2008NatNa...3...31C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis==

Several synthesis methods are known for SiNWs and these can be broadly divided into methods which start with bulk silicon and remove material to yield nanowires, also known as top-down synthesis, and methods which use a chemical or vapor precursor to build nanowires in a process generally considered to be bottom-up synthesis.&lt;ref name="miko" /&gt;

===Top down synthesis methods===

These methods use material removal techniques to produce nanostructures from a bulk precursor

===Bottom-up synthesis methods===

*[[Vapor–liquid–solid method|Vapour liquid solid (VLS)]] growth – a type of catalysed [[Chemical vapor deposition|CVD]] often using [[silane]] as Si precursor and gold nanoparticles as catalyst (or 'seed').&lt;ref name="miko" /&gt;

*Precipitation from a solution – A variation of the VLS method, aptly named supercritical fluid liquid solid (SFLS), that uses a [[supercritical fluid]] (e.g. organosilane at high temperature and pressure) as Si precursor instead of vapor. The catalyst would be a colloid in solution, such as [[colloidal gold]] nanoparticles, and the SiNWs are grown in this solution&lt;ref name="shao" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Holmes | first1=J. | last2=Keith  |first2= P. |last3=Johnston | first3=R. | last4=Doty| first4=C.|title= Control of thickness and orientation of solution-grown silicon nanowires | journal= Science | year=2000| volume=287 |issue= 5457| pages= 1471–1473 | doi=10.1126/science.287.5457.1471|bibcode=2000Sci...287.1471H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermal oxidation===

Subsequent to physical or chemical processing, either top-down or bottom-up, to obtain initial silicon nanostructures, thermal oxidation steps are often applied in order to obtain materials with desired size and [[aspect ratio]]. Silicon nanowires exhibit a distinct and useful self-limiting [[oxidation]] behaviour whereby oxidation effectively ceases due to [[diffusion]] limitations, which can be modeled.&lt;ref name="slo" /&gt; This phenomenon allows accurate control of dimensions and aspect ratios in SiNWs and has been used to obtain high aspect ratio SiNWs with diameters below 5&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Liu | first1= H.I. | last2= Biegelsen |first2=D.K. |last3=Ponce | first3=F.A. | last4=Johnson | first4=N.M.|  last5=Pease | first5=R.F.W.|title= Self-limiting oxidation for fabricating sub-5 nm silicon nanowires | journal= | year=|issue=| pages=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The self-limiting oxidation of SiNWs is of value towards lithium ion battery materials.

==Orientation of nanowires==

The orientation of SiNWs has profound influence on the strucutal and electronic properties of  the systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Justo|first1=J.F.|last2=Menezes|first2=R.D.|last3=Assali|first3=L.V.C.|title=Stability and plasticity of silicon nanowires: The role of wire perimeter|journal=Phys. Rev. B|date=2007|volume=75|issue=4|page=045303|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.75.045303|arxiv=1307.3274|bibcode=2007PhRvB..75d5303J}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason several procedures have been proposed for the alignment of nanowires in chosen orientations. This includes the use of electric fields in polar alignment, [[electrophoresis]], mircofluidic methods and contact printing.

==Outlook==

There is significant interest in SiNWs for their unique properties and the ability to control size and aspect ratio with great accuracy. As yet, limitations in large-scale fabrication impede the uptake of this material in the full range of investigated applications. Combined studies of synthesis methods, oxidation kinetics and properties of SiNW systems aim to overcome the present limitations and facilitate the implementation of SiNW systems, for example, high quality vapor-liquid-solid–grown SiNWs with smooth surfaces can be reversibly stretched with 10% or more elastic strain, approaching the theoretical elastic limit of silicon, which could open the doors for the emerging “elastic strain engineering” and flexible bio-/nano-electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Zhang | first1= H. | last2= Tersoff |first2=J. |last3=Xu | first3=S. | display-authors=etal |title= Approaching the ideal elastic strain limit in silicon nanowires | journal=Science Advances | year=2016| volume=2 |issue=8| pages=e1501382 | doi=10.1126/sciadv.1501382| pmid= 27540586 | pmc= 4988777 |bibcode=2016SciA....2E1382Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Cello natural harmonics.png|thumb|Two different notations of natural harmonics on the cello. First as sounded (more common), then as fingered (easier to sightread).]]

A '''harmonic''' is any member of the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]. The term is employed in various disciplines, including music, physics, [[acoustics]], electronic power transmission, radio technology, and other fields. It is typically applied to repeating signals, such as [[Sine|sinusoidal]] waves. A harmonic of such a [[wave]] is a wave with a [[frequency]] that is a positive [[integer]] multiple of the frequency of the original wave, known as the [[fundamental frequency]]. The original [[wave]] is also called the 1st harmonic, the following harmonics are known as higher harmonics. As all harmonics are periodic at the fundamental frequency, the sum of harmonics is also periodic at that frequency. For example, if the fundamental frequency is 50&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]], a common [[alternating current|AC]] power supply frequency, the frequencies of the first three higher harmonics are 100&amp;nbsp;Hz (2nd harmonic), 150&amp;nbsp;Hz (3rd harmonic), 200&amp;nbsp;Hz (4th harmonic) and any addition of waves with these frequencies is periodic at 50&amp;nbsp;Hz.

{{Quote|An ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; characteristic mode, for ''n'' &gt; 1, will have nodes that are not vibrating. For example, the 3rd characteristic mode will have nodes at &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;''L'' and &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt;''L'', where ''L'' is the length of the string. In fact, each ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; characteristic mode, for ''n'' not a multiple of 3, will '''not''' have nodes at these points. These other characteristic modes will be ''vibrating'' at the positions &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;''L'' and &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt;''L''. If the player ''gently touches'' one of these positions, then these other characteristic modes will be suppressed. The tonal harmonics from these other characteristic modes will then also be suppressed. Consequently, the tonal harmonics from the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; characteristic modes, where ''n'' is a multiple of 3, will be made relatively more prominent.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, James and Don, Gary (2013). ''Mathematics and Music'', p. 147. CRC. {{ISBN|9781439867099}}.&lt;!--emphasis original--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In music, harmonics are used on string instruments and wind instruments as a way of producing sound on the instrument, particularly to play higher notes and, with strings, obtain notes that have a unique sound quality or "tone colour". On strings, harmonics that are bowed have a "glassy", pure tone. On stringed instruments, harmonics are played by touching (but not fully pressing down the string) at an exact point on the string while sounding the string (plucking, bowing, etc.); this allows the harmonic to sound, a pitch which is always higher than the fundamental frequency of the string.

==Terminology==
Harmonics may also be called "overtones", "partials" or "upper partials". The difference between "harmonic" and "overtone" is that the term "harmonic" includes all of the notes in a series, including the fundamental frequency (e.g., the open string of a guitar). The term "overtone" only includes the pitches above the fundamental. In some music contexts, the terms "harmonic", "overtone" and "partial" are used fairly interchangeably.

==Characteristics==
{{Quote|A whizzing, whistling tonal character, distinguishes all the harmonics both natural and artificial from the firmly stopped intervals; therefore their application in connection with the latter must always be carefully considered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://imslp.org/wiki/Category:Scholz,_Richard Scholz, Richard] (1900). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=CCQuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=%22artificial+harmonic%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiT2I__87_YAhVB42MKHf_3AiAQ6AEIWDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22artificial%20harmonic%22&amp;f=false The Technique of the Violin&lt;!--together with ''The Art of Musical Interpretation''--&gt;]'', p. 9. Translated by [http://imslp.org/wiki/Category:Saenger,_Gustav Saenger, Gustav]; ed. New York: Carl Fischer. {{pre-ISBN}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Most acoustic instruments emit complex tones containing many individual partials (component simple tones or sinusoidal waves), but the untrained human ear typically does not perceive those partials as separate phenomena. Rather, a musical note is perceived as one sound, the quality or [[timbre]] of that sound being a result of the relative strengths of the individual partials. Many acoustic [[oscillator]]s, such as the [[human voice]] or a [[Bow (music)|bowed]] [[violin]] string, produce complex tones that are more or less [[Periodic function|periodic]], and thus are composed of partials that are near matches to integer multiples of the fundamental frequency and therefore resemble the ideal harmonics and are called "harmonic partials" or simply "harmonics" for convenience (although it's not strictly accurate to call a partial a harmonic, the first being real and the second being ideal).

Oscillators that produce harmonic partials behave somewhat like one-dimensional [[resonator]]s, and are often long and thin, such as a guitar string or a column of air open at both ends (as with the modern orchestral [[transverse flute]]). Wind instruments whose air column is open at only one end, such as trumpets and clarinets, also produce partials resembling harmonics. However they only produce partials matching the odd harmonics, at least in theory. The reality of acoustic instruments is such that none of them behaves as perfectly as the somewhat simplified theoretical models would predict.

Partials whose frequencies are not integer multiples of the fundamental are referred to as [[Inharmonicity|''inharmonic partials'']]. Some acoustic instruments emit a mix of harmonic and inharmonic partials but still produce an effect on the ear of having a definite fundamental pitch, such as [[piano]]s, strings plucked [[pizzicato]], vibraphones, marimbas, and certain pure-sounding bells or chimes. Antique [[singing bowl]]s are known for producing multiple harmonic partials or [[multiphonics]].

==Partials, overtones, and harmonics==
&lt;!-- [[Flageolet (disambiguation)]] links to this section --&gt;

An [[overtone]] is any partial higher than the lowest partial in a compound tone. The relative strengths and frequency relationships of the component partials determine the timbre of an instrument. The similarity between the terms overtone and partial sometimes leads to their being loosely used interchangeably in a [[music]]al context, but they are counted differently, leading to some possible confusion. In the special case of instrumental timbres whose component partials closely match a harmonic series (such as with most strings and winds) rather than being inharmonic partials (such as with most pitched percussion instruments), it is also convenient to call the component partials "harmonics" but not strictly correct (because harmonics are numbered the same even when missing, while partials and overtones are only counted when present). This chart demonstrates how the three types of names (partial, overtone, and harmonic) are counted (assuming that the harmonics are present):

In many [[musical instruments]], it is possible to play the upper harmonics without the fundamental note being present. In a simple case (e.g., [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]) this has the effect of making the note go up in pitch by an [[octave]], but in more complex cases many other pitch variations are obtained. In some cases it also changes the [[timbre]] of the note. This is part of the normal method of obtaining higher notes in [[wind instruments]], where it is called ''[[overblowing]]''. The [[extended technique]] of playing [[multiphonic]]s also produces harmonics. On [[string instruments]] it is possible to produce very pure sounding notes, called harmonics or ''flageolets'' by string players, which have an eerie quality, as well as being high in pitch. Harmonics may be used to check at a [[unison]] the tuning of strings that are not tuned to the unison. For example, lightly fingering the node found halfway down the highest string of a [[cello]] produces the same pitch as lightly fingering the node {{1/3}} of the way down the second highest string. For the human voice see [[Overtone singing]], which uses harmonics.

While it is true that electronically produced periodic tones (e.g. square waves or other non-sinusoidal waves) have "harmonics" that are whole number multiples of the fundamental frequency, practical instruments do not all have this characteristic. For example, higher "harmonics"' of piano notes are not true harmonics but are "overtones" and can be very sharp, i.e. a higher frequency than given by a pure [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]. This is especially true of instruments other than stringed or brass/woodwind ones, e.g., xylophone, drums, bells etc., where not all the overtones have a simple whole number ratio with the fundamental frequency. The [[fundamental frequency]] is the [[Reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]] of the [[period (physics)|period]] of the periodic phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{FS1037C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==On stringed instruments==
[[Image:Flageolette.svg|thumb|200px|Playing a harmonic on a string]]

{{Quote|Harmonics may be singly produced [on stringed instruments] (1) by varying the point of contact with the bow, or (2) by slightly pressing the string at the nodes, or divisions of its aliquot parts (&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;, etc.). (1) In the first case, advancing the bow from the usual place where the fundamental note is produced, towards the bridge, the whole scale of harmonics may be produced in succession, on an old and highly resonant instrument. The employment of this means produces the effect called '[[sul ponticello]].' (2) The production of harmonics by the slight pressure of the finger on the open string is more useful. When produced by pressing slightly on the various nodes of the open strings they are called 'Natural harmonics.' ... Violinists are well aware that the longer the string in proportion to its thickness, the greater the number of upper harmonics it can be made to yield.|''[[Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' (1879)&lt;ref&gt;[[George Grove|Grove, George]] (1879). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EP8PAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA665&amp;dq=%22artificial+harmonic%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjd3uOetcDYAhVDw2MKHZ2yCQE4ChDoAQgyMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22artificial%20harmonic%22&amp;f=false A Dictionary of Music and Musicians (A.D. 1450–1889)]'', Vol. 2, p. 665.

The following table displays the stop points on a stringed instrument, such as the [[guitar]] ([[guitar harmonic]]s), at which gentle touching of a string will force it into a harmonic mode when vibrated. String harmonics  (flageolet tones) are described as having a "flutelike, silvery quality" that can be highly effective as a special color or tone color ([[timbre]]) when used and heard in [[orchestration]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennan, Kent and Grantham, Donald (2002/1952). ''The Technique of Orchestration'', p. 69. Sixth Edition. {{ISBN|0-13-040771-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unusual to encounter natural harmonics higher than the fifth partial on any stringed instrument except the double bass, on account of its much longer strings.&lt;ref&gt;Kennan &amp; Grantham, ibid, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Harmonics are widely used in plucked string instruments, such as [[acoustic guitar]], [[electric guitar]] and [[electric bass]]. On an electric guitar played loudly through a [[guitar amplifier]] with [[distortion (music)|distortion]], harmonics are more sustained and can be used in [[guitar solos]]. In the [[heavy metal music]] lead guitar style known as [[shred guitar]], harmonics, both natural and artificial, are widely used.

===Table===

[[Image:Table_of_Harmonics.svg|thumb|centre|550px|Table of harmonics of a stringed instrument with colored dots indicating which positions can be lightly fingered to generate [[Just intonation|just intervals]] up to the 7th harmonic]]

===Artificial harmonics===

Although harmonics are most often used on open strings (natural harmonics), occasionally a score will call for an [[artificial harmonic]], produced by playing an overtone on an already stopped string. As a performance technique, it is accomplished by using two fingers on the fingerboard, the first to shorten the string to the desired fundamental, with the second touching the node corresponding to the appropriate harmonic. On fretted instruments, such as an [[electric guitar]], the performer can look at the frets to determine where to stop the string and where to touch the node. On unfretted instruments, such as the violin and related instruments, playing artificial harmonics is an advanced technique, as it requires the performer to find two precise locations on the same string.

==Other information==

Harmonics may be either used or considered as the basis of [[just intonation]] systems. Composer [[Arnold Dreyblatt]] is able to bring out different harmonics on the single string of his modified [[double bass]] by slightly altering his unique [[bow (music)|bowing]] technique halfway between hitting and bowing the strings. Composer [[Lawrence Ball]] uses harmonics to generate music electronically.

From a biological standpoint, the goal-directed molecular motions inside living cells are carried out by [[biopolymer]]s acting like molecular machines (e.g. [[myosin]], RNA/DNA polymerase, [[Ion pump (biology)|ion pumps]], etc.). These molecular machines are driven by '''conformons''', that is sequence-specific mechanical strains generated by free energy released in chemical reactions or stress induced destabilisations in supercoiled biopolymer chains. Therefore, conformons can be defined as packets of conformational energy generated from substrate binding or chemical reactions and confined within biopolymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Molecular Theory of the Living Cell - Springer|journal = Molecular Theory of the Living Cell: Concepts|last=Ji|first=Sungchul|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-2152-8|bibcode = 2012mtlc.book.....J|year = 2012|isbn = 978-1-4614-2151-1|url = http://cds.cern.ch/record/1453271|format = Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, from a physics standpoint, the conformon is a localization of elastic and electronic energy which may propagate in space with or without dissipation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atanasov|first=Victor|last2=Dandoloff|first2=Rossen|title=Quantum-elastic bump on a surface|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0143-0807/38/i=1/a=015405?key=crossref.1c8a808e8c6ca8672e53732ec813d2f7|journal=European Journal of Physics|volume=38|issue=1|pages=015405|doi=10.1088/0143-0807/38/1/015405|arxiv=1402.2078|bibcode=2017EJPh...38a5405A|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism which involves dissipationless propagation is a form of molecular superconductivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balakrishnan|first=Radha|last2=Dandoloff|first2=Rossen|date=2008-01-01|title=Effect of conformations on charge transport in a thin elastic tube|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0951-7715/21/i=1/a=001|journal=Nonlinearity|language=en|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1|doi=10.1088/0951-7715/21/1/001|issn=0951-7715|arxiv=0803.3407|bibcode=2008Nonli..21....1B}}&lt;/ref&gt; On quantum mechanical level both elastic/vibrational and electronic energy can be quantised, therefore the conformon carries a fixed portion of energy. This has led to the definition of quantum of conformation (shape).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atanasov|first=Victor|last2=Omar|first2=Yasser|date=2010-01-01|title=Quanta of local conformational change: conformons in α-helical proteins|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1367-2630/12/i=5/a=055003|journal=New Journal of Physics|language=en|volume=12|issue=5|pages=055003|doi=10.1088/1367-2630/12/5/055003|issn=1367-2630|arxiv=0906.0456|bibcode=2010NJPh...12e5003A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Collaborative Computational Projects (CCP) group was responsible for the development of '''CCPForge''', which is a software development tool produced through collaborations by the CCP community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2011-10-14|title=Elastic and inelastic low-energy electron collisions with pyrazine|journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics|volume=135|issue=14|pages=144308|doi=10.1063/1.3650236|pmid=22010719|issn=0021-9606|bibcode=2011JChPh.135n4308M|last1=Mašín|first1=Zdeněk|last2=Gorfinkiel|first2=Jimena D}}&lt;/ref&gt; CCPs allow experts in computational research to come together and develop scientific software which can be applied to numerous research fields. It is used as a tool in many research and development areas, and hosts a variety of projects. Every CCP project is the result of years of valuable work by computational researchers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccp.ac.uk|title=UK Collaborative Computational Projects|website=www.ccp.ac.uk|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is advised for projects to have one application, this helps users to search a category and classification system so they can find the right project for their work.

{{expert needed|1=Physics|reason=There appear to be lots of potential sources for this, but none that cover the basics mentioned in this article. It also seems like there should be better categories|date=November 2016}}

'''Normal contact stiffness''' is a physical quantity related to the generalized force displacement behavior of [[Surface roughness|rough surface]]s in contact with a [[rigid body]] or a second similar rough surface.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} As two solid bodies of the same material approach one another, they transition from conditions of non-contact to homogeneous bulk type behaviour. The varying values of stiffness and true contact area that is exhibited at an interface during this transition is dependent on conditions of applied pressure and is of notable importance for the study of systems involving the physical interactions of multiple bodies including [[granular matter]], [[electrode]] contacts, and [[thermal contact]]s, where the interface-localized structures govern overall system performance.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Surface structure==
The role of [[surface structure]] in normal contact mechanics, in terms of stiffness and true contact area is a frequently studied topic.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Parameters of roughness, [[fractal dimension]] and [[Asperity (materials science)|asperity geometry]] are often discussed{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} with reference to their significance on contact mechanics of surfaces.

A '''straw tracker''' is a type of [[particle detector]] which uses many [[straw chamber]]s to track the path of a [[Elementary particle|particle]].  

== Principle of operation ==
The path of a particle is determined by the best fit to all the straws with '''hits'''. Since the time for a particular straw to produce a signal is proportional to the distance of the particle's closest approach to that chamber's wire, if a particle on a predictable path (e.g. a [[helix]] in a [[magnetic field]]) passes through many straws, the path of the particle can be determined more precisely than the size of any particular straw.

[[File:2 Helium.png|thumb|[[Liquid helium]] retains [[kinetic energy]] and does not freeze regardless of temperature due to zero-point energy. When cooled below its [[Lambda point]], it exhibits properties of [[superfluidity]]]]
{{Quantum mechanics}}
'''Zero-point energy''' ('''ZPE''') is the difference between the lowest possible [[energy]] that a [[quantum mechanical]] system may have, and the classical minimum energy of the system. Unlike in [[classical mechanics]], quantum systems constantly fluctuate in their lowest energy state due to the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]].&lt;ref name="Sciama 1991 137"&gt;{{harvp|Sciama|1991|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as atoms and molecules, the empty space of [[Vacuum state|the vacuum]] has these properties. According to [[quantum field theory]], the universe can be thought of not as isolated particles but continuous fluctuating fields: matter fields, whose [[Quantum|quanta]] are [[fermions]] (i.e. [[lepton]]s and [[quark]]s), and force fields, whose quanta are [[boson]]s (e.g. [[photon]]s and [[gluon]]s). All these fields have zero-point energy.&lt;ref name="Milonni 1994 35"&gt;{{harvp|Milonni|1994|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fluctuating zero-point fields lead to a kind of reintroduction of an [[Luminiferous aether|aether]] in physics,&lt;ref name="Sciama 1991 137"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Davies|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; since some systems can detect the existence of this energy. However this aether cannot be thought of as a physical medium if it is to be [[Lorentz invariant]] such that there is no contradiction with [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] theory of [[special relativity]].&lt;ref name="Sciama 1991 137"/&gt;

Physics currently lacks a full theoretical model for understanding zero-point energy; in particular the discrepancy between theorized and observed vacuum energy is a source of major contention.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Weinberg|1989}} and {{harvp|Peebles|Ratra|2003}} for review articles and  {{harvp|Shiga|2005}}, {{harvp|Siegel|2016}} for press comment&lt;/ref&gt; Physicists [[Richard Feynman]] and [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] calculated the zero-point radiation of the vacuum to be an order of magnitude greater than [[Atomic energy|nuclear energy]], with a single light bulb containing enough energy to boil all the world's oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Pilkington|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet according to Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]] any such energy would gravitate {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} and the experimental evidence from both the [[expansion of the universe]], [[dark energy]] and the [[Casimir effect]] show any such energy to be exceptionally weak. A popular proposal that attempts to address this issue is to say that the [[fermion field]] has a negative zero-point energy while the [[boson field]] has positive zero-point energy and thus these energies somehow cancel each other out.&lt;ref name="harvp|Weinberg|2015|p=376"&gt;{{harvp|Weinberg|2015|p=376}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sciama 1991 138"&gt;{{harvp|Sciama|1991|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea would be true if [[supersymmetry]] were an exact [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetry of nature]]. However, the [[LHC]] at [[CERN]] has so far found no evidence to support [[supersymmetry]]. Moreover, it is known that if supersymmetry is valid at all, it is at most a broken symmetry, only true at very high energies, and no one has been able to show a theory where zero-point cancellations occur in the low energy universe we observe today.&lt;ref name="Sciama 1991 138"/&gt; This discrepancy is known as the [[cosmological constant problem]] and it is one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in physics.

The term '''zero-point energy (ZPE)''' [[Calque|is a translation]] from the German '''Nullpunktsenergie.'''&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Einstein|1995|pp=270-285}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The terms '''zero-point radiation''' or '''ground state energy''' are also sometimes used interchangeably. The term '''zero-point field''' ('''ZPF''') can be used when referring to a specific vacuum field, for instance the [[QED vacuum]] which specifically deals with [[quantum electrodynamics]] (e.g. electromagnetic interactions between photons, electrons and the vacuum) or the [[QCD vacuum]] which deals with [[quantum chromodynamics]] (e.g. [[color charge]] interactions between quarks, gluons and the vacuum). A vacuum can be viewed not as empty space but as the combination of all zero-point fields. In [[quantum field theory]] this combination of fields is called the [[vacuum state]], its associated zero-point energy is called the [[vacuum energy]] and the average energy value  is called the [[vacuum expectation value]] (VEV) also called its '''condensate'''.

==Overview==
[[File:Zero-point energy v.s. motion.jpg|thumb|right|Kinetic energy vs temperature.]]
In [[classical mechanics]] all [[particle]]s can be thought of as having some [[energy]] made up of their [[potential energy]] and [[kinetic energy]]. [[Temperature]], for example, arises from the intensity of random particle motion caused by kinetic energy (known as [[brownian motion]]). As temperature is reduced to [[absolute zero]], it might be thought that all motion ceases and particles come completely to rest. In fact, however, kinetic energy is retained by particles even at the lowest possible temperature. The random motion corresponding to this zero-point energy never vanishes as a consequence of the [[uncertainty principle]] of [[quantum mechanics]].

[[File:Zero-point energy of harmonic oscillator.svg|thumb|left|Zero-point radiation continually imparts random impulses on an [[electron]], so that it never comes to a complete stop. Zero-point radiation gives the [[Harmonic oscillator|oscillator]] an average energy equal to the frequency of oscillation multiplied by one-half of [[Planck constant|Planck's constant]]]]
The uncertainty principle states that no object can ever have precise values of position and velocity simultaneously. The total energy of a quantum mechanical object (potential and kinetic) is described by its [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] which also describes the system as a harmonic oscillator, or [[wave function]], that fluctuates between various energy states (see [[wave-particle duality]]). All quantum mechanical systems undergo fluctuations even in their ground state, a consequence of their [[wave]]-like nature. The uncertainty principle requires every quantum mechanical system to have a fluctuating zero-point energy greater than the minimum of its classical [[potential well]]. This results in motion even at [[absolute zero]]. For example, [[liquid helium]] does not freeze under atmospheric pressure regardless of temperature due to its zero-point energy.

Given the equivalence of mass and energy expressed by [[Einstein]]'s [[E = mc2|{{math|''E'' {{=}} ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}]], any point in [[Spacetime|space]] that contains energy can be thought of as having mass to create particles. [[Virtual particles]] spontaneously flash into existence at every point in space due to the energy of [[quantum fluctuations]] caused by the uncertainty principle. Modern physics has developed [[quantum field theory]] (QFT) to understand the fundamental interactions between matter and forces, it treats every single point of space as a [[Harmonic oscillator (quantum)|quantum harmonic oscillator]]. According to QFT the universe is made up of matter fields, whose [[Quantum|quanta]] are [[fermions]] (i.e. [[lepton]]s and [[quark]]s), and force fields, whose quanta are [[boson]]s (e.g. [[photon]]s and [[gluon]]s). All these fields have zero-point energy.&lt;ref name="Milonni 1994 35"/&gt; Recent experiments advocate the idea that particles themselves can be thought of as excited states of the underlying [[quantum vacuum]], and that all properties of matter are merely vacuum fluctuations arising from interactions of the zero-point field.&lt;ref name="harvp|Battersby|2008"&gt;{{harvp|Battersby|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that "empty" space can have an intrinsic energy associated to it, and that there is no such thing as a "true vacuum" is seemingly unintuitive. It is often argued that the entire universe is completely bathed in the zero-point radiation, and as such it can add only some constant amount to calculations. Physical measurements will therefore reveal only deviations from this value.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvp|Itzykson|Zuber|1980|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many practical calculations zero-point energy is dismissed by fiat in the mathematical model as a term that has no physical effect. Such treatment causes problems however, as in Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]] the absolute energy value of space is not an arbitrary constant and gives rise to the [[cosmological constant]]. For decades most physicists assumed that there was some undiscovered fundamental principle that will remove the infinite zero-point energy and make it completely vanish. If the vacuum has no intrinsic, absolute value of energy it will not gravitate. It was believed that as the universe expands from the aftermath of the [[big bang]], the energy contained in any unit of empty space will decrease as the total energy spreads out to fill the volume of the universe; [[galaxies]] and all matter in the universe should begin to decelerate. This possibility was ruled out in 1998 by the discovery that the expansion of the universe is not slowing down but is in fact accelerating, meaning empty space does indeed have some intrinsic energy. The discovery of [[dark energy]] is best explained by zero-point energy, though it still remains a mystery as to why the value appears to be so small compared to huge value obtained through theory - the [[cosmological constant problem]].&lt;ref name="harvp|Weinberg|2015|p=376"/&gt;

Many physical effects attributed to zero-point energy have been experimentally verified, such as [[spontaneous emission]], [[Casimir force]], [[Lamb shift]], [[Electron magnetic moment|magnetic moment of the electron]] and [[Delbrück scattering]],&lt;ref name="harvp|Milonni|1994|p=111"&gt;{{harvp|Milonni|1994|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Greiner|Müller|Rafelski|2012|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; these effects are usually called "radiative corrections".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bordag et al.|2009|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In more complex nonlinear theories (e.g. QCD) zero-point energy can give rise to a variety of complex phenomena such as [[Bistability|multiple stable states]], [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|symmetry breaking]], [[chaos theory|chaos]] and [[emergence]]. Many physicists believe that "the vacuum holds the key to a full understanding of nature"&lt;ref name="harvp|Davies|1985|p=104"/&gt; and that studying it is critical in the search for the [[theory of everything]]. Active areas of research include the effects of virtual particles,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cho|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[quantum entanglement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Choi|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the difference (if any) between [[Mass#Inertial mass|inertial and gravitational mass]],&lt;ref name="Haisch et al. 1994"&gt;See {{harvp|Haisch|Rueda|Puthoff|1994}} for proposal and {{harvs|txt|last1=Matthews|year1=1994|year2=1995}}, {{harvp|Powell|1994}} and {{harvp|Davies|1994}} for comment&lt;/ref&gt; variation in the [[speed of light]],&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Urban et al.|2013}}, {{harvp|Leuchs|Sánchez-Soto|2013}} and {{harvp|O'Carroll|2013}} for comment&lt;/ref&gt; a reason for the observed value of the [[cosmological constant]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rugh|Zinkernagel|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the nature of [[dark energy]].&lt;ref name="Dark Energy May Be Vacuum"&gt;{{harvp|Niels Bohr Institute|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="space.com"&gt;{{harvp|Wall|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early aether theories===
[[File:James Clerk Maxwell.png|thumb|upright|James Clerk Maxwell]]
Zero-point energy evolved from historical ideas about the [[vacuum]]. To [[Aristotle]] the vacuum was {{lang|grc|τὸ κενόν}}, "the empty"; space independent of body. He believed this concept violated basic physical principles and asserted that [[Classical element#Greece|the elements]] of fire, air, earth, and water were not made of atoms, but were continuous. To the [[atomists]] the concept of emptiness had absolute character: it was the distinction between existence and nonexistence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Saunders| Brown|1991|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debate about the characteristics of the vacuum were largely confined to the realm of [[philosophy]], it was not until much later on with the beginning of [[Renaissance|the renaissance]], that [[Otto von Guericke]] invented the first vacuum pump and the first testable scientific ideas began to emerge. It was thought that a totally empty volume of space could be created by simply removing all gases. This was the first generally accepted concept of the vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Conlon|2011|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in the 19th century, however, it became apparent that the evacuated region still contained [[thermal radiation]]. The existence of the [[Luminiferous aether|aether]] as a substitute for a true void was the most prevalent theory of the time. According to the successful [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] aether theory based upon [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell's]] [[electrodynamics]], this all-encompassing aether was endowed with energy and hence very different from nothingness. The fact that electromagnetic and gravitational phenomena were easily transmitted in empty space indicated that their associated aethers were part of the fabric of space itself. Maxwell himself noted that:

{{bquote|To those who maintained the existence of a plenum as a philosophical principle, nature's abhorrence of a vacuum was a sufficient reason for imagining an all-surrounding aether... Aethers were invented for the planets to swim in, to constitute electric atmospheres and magnetic effluvia, to convey sensations from one part of our bodies to another, and so on, till a space had been filled three or four times with aethers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kragh|Overduin|2014|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, the results of the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] in 1887 were the first strong evidence that the then-prevalent aether theories were seriously flawed, and initiated a line of research that eventually led to [[special relativity]], which ruled out the idea of a stationary aether altogether. To scientists of the period, it seemed that a true vacuum in space might be completely eliminated by cooling thus eliminating all radiation or energy. From this idea evolved the second concept of achieving a real vacuum: cool it down to [[absolute zero]] temperature after evacuation. Absolute zero was technically impossible to achieve in the 19th century, so the debate remained unsolved.

===Second quantum theory===
[[File:Max Planck (Nobel 1918).jpg|thumb|upright|Planck in 1918, the year he received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his work on [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]]]]
In 1900, [[Max Planck]] derived the average energy {{mvar|ε}} of a single ''energy radiator'', e.g., a vibrating atomic unit, as a function of absolute temperature:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Planck|1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon = \frac{h\nu}{ e^{h\nu/(kT)}-1} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|h}} is [[Planck's constant]], {{mvar|ν}} is the [[frequency]], {{mvar|k}} is [[Boltzmann's constant]], and {{mvar|T}} is the absolute [[temperature]]. The zero-point energy makes no contribution to Planck's original law, as its existence was unknown to Planck in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Loudon|2000|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of zero-point energy was developed by [[Max Planck]] in Germany in 1911 as a corrective term added to a zero-grounded formula developed in his original quantum theory in 1900.&lt;ref name="Kragh"/&gt;

In 1912, Max Planck published the first journal article&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Planck|1912a}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the discontinuous emission of radiation, based on the discrete quanta of energy. In Planck's "second quantum theory" resonators absorbed energy continuously, but emitted energy in discrete energy quanta only when they reached the boundaries of finite cells in phase space, where their energies became integer multiples of {{math|''hν''}}. This theory led Planck to his new radiation law, but in this version energy resonators possessed a zero-point energy, the smallest average energy a resonator could take on. Planck's radiation equation contained a residual energy factor, one {{math|{{sfrac|''hν''|2}}}}, as an additional term dependent on the frequency {{mvar|ν}}, which was greater than zero (where {{mvar|h}} is Planck's constant). It is therefore widely agreed that "Planck's equation marked the birth of the concept of zero-point energy."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Milonni|1994|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of papers from 1911 to 1913,&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvs|last1=Planck|year1=1911|year2=1912a|year3=1912b|year4=1913}} and {{harvp|Planck|1958}} for reprints&lt;/ref&gt; Planck found that the average energy of an oscillator to be:&lt;ref name="Kragh"&gt;{{harvp|Kragh|2012|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuhn1987"&gt;{{harvp|Kuhn|1978|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon =\frac{h\nu} 2 + \frac{h\nu}{e^{h\nu/(kT)}-1} ~.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Albert Einstein (Nobel).png|thumb|upright|Einstein's official 1921 portrait after receiving the Nobel Prize in Physics]]
Soon, the idea of zero-point energy attracted the attention of [[Albert Einstein]] and his assistant [[Otto Stern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Einstein|first1=Albert|last2=Stern|first2=Otto|title=Einige Argumente für die Annahme einer molekularen Agitation beim absoluten Nullpunkt|journal=Annalen der Physik|date=1913|volume=345|issue=3|pages=551–560|doi=10.1002/andp.19133450309|bibcode=1913AnP...345..551E}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913 they published a paper that attempted to prove the existence of zero-point energy by calculating the specific heat of hydrogen gas and compared it with the experimental data. However, after assuming they had succeeded, they retracted support for the idea shortly after publication because they found Planck's second theory may not apply to their example. In a letter to [[Paul Ehrenfest]] of the same year Einstein declared zero-point energy “dead as a doornail”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Einstein|first1=Albert.|editor1-last=Klein|editor1-first=Martin J.|editor2-last=Kox|editor2-first=A.

In 1916 [[Walther Nernst]] proposed that empty space was filled with zero-point [[electromagnetic radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nernst|first1=Walther|title=Über einen Versuch, von quantentheoretischen Betrachtungen zur Annahme stetiger Energieänderungen zurückzukehren|journal=Verhandlungen der Deutschen Physikalischen|date=1916|volume=18|pages=83–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the development of [[general relativity]] Einstein found the energy density of the vacuum to contribute towards a [[cosmological constant]] in order to obtain static solutions to his field equations; the idea that empty space, or the vacuum, could have some intrinsic energy associated to it had returned, with Einstein stating in 1920:

{{bquote|There is a weighty argument to be adduced in favour of the aether hypothesis. To deny the aether is ultimately to assume that empty space has no physical qualities whatever. The fundamental facts of mechanics do not harmonize with this view... according to the general theory of relativity space is endowed with physical qualities; in this sense, therefore, there exists an aether. According to the general theory of relativity space without aether is unthinkable; for in such space there not only would be no propagation of light, but also no possibility of existence for standards of space and time (measuring-rods and clocks), nor therefore any space-time intervals in the physical sense. But this aether may not be thought of as endowed with the quality characteristic of ponderable media, as consisting of parts which may be tracked through time. The idea of motion may not be applied to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Einstein|first1=Albert|title=Äther und relativitäts-theorie|date=1920|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Einstein|first1=Albert|editor1-last=Jeffery|editor1-first=G.

According to classical ideas, the fact that an accelerating charge loses energy by radiating implied that an electron should spiral into the nucleus and that atoms should not be stable.

[[File:Dirac 4.jpg|thumb|upright|Paul Dirac 1933]]
Building on the work of Heisenberg and others [[Paul Dirac]]'s theory of emission and absorption (1927)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dirac|first1=Paul Adrien Maurice|title=The Quantum Theory of the Emission and Absorption of Radiation|journal=Proc.

&lt;/ref&gt; In a process in which a photon is annihilated (absorbed), the photon can be thought of as making a transition into the vacuum state. Similarly, when a photon is created (emitted), it is occasionally useful to imagine that the photon has made a transition out of the vacuum state. In the words of Dirac:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dirac|first1=Paul A. M.|title=The Quantum Theory of the Emission and Absorption of Radiation|journal=Proc. Roy. Soc.|date=1927|volume=A114|issue=767|pages=243–265|doi=10.1098/rspa.1927.0039|url=http://www.imotiro.org/repositorio/howto/artigoshistoricosordemcronologica/1927%20-%20DIRAC%201927%20First%20steps%20in%20quantum%20field%20theory%20Invention%20of%20the%20second%20quantization%20method.pdf|accessdate=17 October 2016|bibcode=1927RSPSA.114..243D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bquote|The light-quantum has the peculiarity that it apparently ceases to exist when it is in one of its stationary states, namely, the zero state, in which its momentum and therefore also its energy, are zero. When a light-quantum is absorbed it can be considered to jump into this zero state, and when one is emitted it can be considered to jump from the zero state to one in which it is physically in evidence, so that it appears to have been created. Since there is no limit to the number of light-quanta that may be created in this way, we must suppose that there are an infinite number of light quanta in the zero state...}}

Contemporary physicists, when asked to give a physical explanation for spontaneous emission, generally invoke the zero-point energy of the electromagnetic field. This view was popularized by [[Victor Weisskopf]] who in 1935 wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weisskopf|first1=Viktor|title=Probleme der neueren Quantentheorie des Elektrons|journal=Naturwissenschaften|date=1935|volume=23|issue=37|pages=631–637|doi=10.1007/BF01492012|bibcode=1935NW.....23..631W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bquote|From quantum theory there follows the existence of so called zero-point oscillations; for example each oscillator in its lowest is not completely at rest but always is moving about its equilibrium position. Therefore electromagnetic oscillations also can never cease completely. Thus the quantum nature of the electromagnetic field has as its consequence zero point oscillations of the field strength in the lowest energy state, in which there are no light quanta in space... The zero point oscillations act on an electron in the same way as ordinary electrical oscillations do. They can change the eigenstate of the electron, but only in a transition to a state with the lowest energy, since empty space can only take away energy, and not give it up. In this way spontaneous radiation arises as a consequence of the existence of these unique field strengths corresponding to zero point oscillations. Thus spontaneous radiation is induced radiation of light quanta produced by zero point oscillations of empty space}}

This view was also later supported by [[:de:Theodore Welton|Theodore Welton]] (1948),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Welton|first1=Theodore Allen|title=Some observable effects of the quantum-mechanical fluctuations of the electromagnetic field|journal=Physical Review|date=1948|volume=74|issue=9|page=1157|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.74.1157|bibcode=1948PhRv...74.1157W}}&lt;/ref&gt; who argued that spontaneous emission "can be thought of as forced emission taking place under the action of the fluctuating field." This new theory, which Dirac coined [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED) predicted a fluctuating zero-point or "vacuum" field existing even in the absence of sources.

Throughout the 1940s improvements in [[microwave]] technology made it possible to take more precise measurements of the shift of the levels of a [[hydrogen atom]], now known as the [[Lamb shift]],&lt;ref name=lamb&gt;

In 1948 [[Hendrik Casimir]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Casimir|first1=Hendrik Brugt Gerhard|last2=Polder|first2=Dirk|title=The Influence of Retardation on the London-van der Waals Forces|journal=Physical Review|date=1948|volume=73|issue=4|page=360|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.73.360|bibcode=1948PhRv...73..360C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Casimir|first1=Hendrik Brugt Gerhard|title=On the attraction between two perfectly conducting plates|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences|date=1948|volume=51|pages=793–795|url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/DL/publications/PU00018547.pdf|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that one consequence of the zero-point field is an attractive force between two uncharged, perfectly conducting parallel plates, the so-called [[Casimir effect]]. At the time, Casimir was studying the properties of "colloidal solutions". These are viscous materials, such as paint and mayonnaise, that contain micron-sized particles in a liquid matrix. The properties of such solutions are determined by [[van der Waals forces]] – long-range, attractive forces that exist between neutral atoms and molecules. One of Casimir's colleagues, Theo Overbeek, realized that the theory that was used at the time to explain van der Waals forces, which had been developed by [[Fritz London]] in 1930,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author1=R.

Overbeek therefore asked Casimir to investigate the problem. Working with [[Dirk Polder]], Casimir discovered that the interaction between two neutral molecules could be correctly described only if the fact that light travels at a finite speed was taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lambrecht|first1=Astrid|title=The Casimir effect: a force from nothing|date=2002|volume=September|pages=29–32|url=https://indico.cern.ch/event/247728/contributions/1569920/attachments/426300/591724/Casimir_Force_PhysWorld_2002.pdf|accessdate=24 October 2016|publisher=Institute of Physics Publishing|issn=0953-8585}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards after a conversation with [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]] about zero-point energy, Casimir noticed that this result could be interpreted in terms of vacuum fluctuations. He then asked himself what would happen if there were two mirrors – rather than two molecules – facing each other in a vacuum. It was this work that led to his famous prediction of an attractive force between reflecting plates. The work by Casimir and Polder opened up the way to a unified theory of van der Waals and Casimir forces and a smooth continuum between the two phenomena. This was done by Lifshitz (1956)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Theory of Molecular Attractive Forces between Solids|last = Lifshitz|first = E.

==The uncertainty principle==

{{main|Uncertainty principle}}

Zero-point energy is fundamentally related to the Heisenberg [[uncertainty principle]].&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1927"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=W. Heisenberg|title=Über den anschaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik|journal =Zeitschrift für Physik|volume=43|issue=3|year=1927|pages=172–198|doi=10.1007/BF01397280|url=http://scarc.library.oregonstate.edu/coll/pauling/bond/papers/corr155.1.html |bibcode = 1927ZPhy...43..172H |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly speaking, the uncertainty principle states that complementary variables (such as a particle's position and momentum, or a field's value and derivative at a point in space) cannot simultaneously be specified precisely by any given quantum state. In particular, there cannot exist a state in which the system simply sits motionless at the bottom of its potential well: for, then, its position and momentum would both be completely determined to arbitrarily great precision. Therefore, instead, the lowest-energy state (the ground state) of the system must have a distribution in position and momentum that satisfies the uncertainty principle−−which implies its energy must be greater than the minimum of the potential well.

Near the bottom of a [[potential well]], the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] of a general system (the quantum-mechanical [[operator (physics)|operator]] giving its energy) can be approximated as a [[quantum harmonic oscillator]],
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{H} = V_0 + \tfrac{1}{2} k \left(\hat{x} - x_0\right)^2 + \frac{1}{2m} \hat{p}^2 \,,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the minimum of the classical potential well.

The uncertainty principle tells us that
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\left\langle \left(\hat{x} - x_0\right)^2 \right\rangle} \sqrt{\left\langle \hat{p}^2 \right\rangle} \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} \,,&lt;/math&gt;
making the [[expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation value]]s of the [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] and [[potential energy|potential]] terms above satisfy
:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \tfrac{1}{2} k \left(\hat{x} - x_0\right)^2 \right\rangle \left\langle \frac{1}{2m} \hat{p}^2 \right\rangle \geq \left(\frac{\hbar}{4}\right)^2 \frac{k}{m} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The expectation value of the energy must therefore be at least
:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \hat{H} \right\rangle \geq V_0 + \frac{\hbar}{2} \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = V_0 + \frac{\hbar \omega}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''ω'' {{=}} {{sqrt|''k''/''m''}}}} is the [[angular frequency]] at which the system oscillates.

A more thorough treatment, showing that the energy of the ground state actually saturates this bound and is exactly {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''V''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + {{sfrac|''ħω''|2}}}}, requires solving for the ground state of the system.

==Atomic physics==

{{main|ground state}}
[[File:QHO-groundstate-animation-color.gif|thumb|The zero-point energy {{math|''E'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''ħω''|2}}}} causes the ground-state of a harmonic oscillator to advance its phase (color). This has measurable effects when several eigenstates are superimposed.]]

The idea of a [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] and its associated energy can apply to either an atom or subatomic particle. In ordinary atomic physics, the zero-point energy is the energy associated with the [[ground state]] of the system. The professional physics literature tends to measure frequency, as denoted by {{mvar|ν}} above, using [[angular frequency]], denoted with {{mvar|ω}} and defined by {{math|''ω'' {{=}} 2''πν''}}. This leads to a convention of writing Planck's constant {{mvar|h}} with a bar through its top ({{mvar|ħ}}) to denote the quantity {{math|{{sfrac|''h''|2π}}}}. In these terms, the most famous such example of zero-point energy is the above {{math|''E'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''ħω''|2}}}} associated with the ground state of the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]]. In quantum mechanical terms, the zero-point energy is the [[expectation value]] of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] of the system in the ground state.

If more than one ground state exists, they are said to be [[degenerate energy level|degenerate]]. Many systems have degenerate ground states. Degeneracy occurs whenever there exists a [[unitary operator]] which acts non-trivially on a ground state and [[commutator|commutes]] with the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] of the system.

According to the [[third law of thermodynamics]], a system at [[absolute zero]] [[temperature]] exists in its ground state; thus, its [[entropy]] is determined by the degeneracy of the ground state. Many systems, such as a perfect [[crystal lattice]], have a unique ground state and therefore have zero entropy at absolute zero. It is also possible for the highest excited state to have [[absolute zero]] [[temperature]] for systems that exhibit [[negative temperature]].

The [[wave function]] of the ground state of a [[particle in a box|particle in a one-dimensional well]] is a half-period [[sine wave]] which goes to zero at the two edges of the well. The energy of the particle is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{h^2 n^2}{8 m L^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|h}} is the [[Planck constant]], {{mvar|m}} is the mass of the particle, {{mvar|n}} is the energy state ({{math|''n'' {{=}} 1}} corresponds to the ground-state energy), and {{mvar|L}} is the width of the well.

==Quantum field theory==
{{Quantum field theory}}
{{main|Vacuum expectation value|Vacuum energy|Vacuum state}}

In [[quantum field theory]] (QFT), the fabric of "empty" space is visualized as consisting of [[field (physics)|fields]], with the field at every point in space and time being a [[quantum harmonic oscillator]], with neighboring oscillators interacting with each other. According to QFT the universe is made up of matter fields whose [[Quantum|quanta]] are [[fermions]] (e.g. [[electron]]s and [[quark]]s) and force fields, whose quanta are [[boson]]s (i.e. [[photon]]s and [[gluon]]s). All these fields have zero-point energy.&lt;ref name="Milonni 1994 35"/&gt; A related term is ''zero-point field'' (ZPF), which is the lowest energy state of a particular field.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vacuum can be viewed not as empty space, but as the combination of all zero-point fields.

In QFT this combination of fields is called the [[vacuum state]], its associated zero-point energy is called the [[vacuum energy]] and the average expectation value of the Hamiltonian is called the [[vacuum expectation value]] (also called condensate or simply VEV). The [[QED vacuum]] is a part of the vacuum state which specifically deals with [[quantum electrodynamics]] (e.g. electromagnetic interactions between photons, electrons and the vacuum) and the [[QCD vacuum]] deals with [[quantum chromodynamics]] (e.g. [[color charge]] interactions between quarks, gluons and the vacuum). Recent experiments advocate the idea that particles themselves can be thought of as excited states of the underlying [[quantum vacuum]], and that all properties of matter are merely vacuum fluctuations arising from interactions with the zero-point field.&lt;ref name="harvp|Battersby|2008"/&gt;

Each point in space makes a contribution of {{math|''E'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''ħω''|2}}}}, resulting in a calculation of infinite zero-point energy in any finite volume; this is one reason [[renormalization]] is needed to make sense of quantum field theories. In [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], the vacuum energy is one possible explanation for the [[cosmological constant]]&lt;ref&gt;

Scientists are not in agreement about how much energy is contained in the vacuum. [[Quantum mechanics]] requires the energy to be large as [[Paul Dirac]] claimed it is, like a [[Dirac sea|sea of energy]]. Other scientists specializing in [[General Relativity]] require the energy to be small enough for [[curvature of space]] to agree with observed [[astronomy]]. The [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] [[uncertainty principle]] allows the energy to be as large as needed to promote quantum actions for a brief moment of time, even if the average energy is small enough to satisfy relativity and flat space. To cope with disagreements, the vacuum energy is described as a [[virtual energy]] [[potential]] of positive and negative energy.&lt;ref&gt;

In quantum [[perturbation theory]], it is sometimes said that the contribution of [[one-loop]] and multi-loop [[Feynman diagram]]s to [[elementary particle]] [[propagator]]s are the contribution of [[quantum fluctuation|vacuum fluctuation]]s, or the zero-point energy to the particle [[mass]]es.

===The quantum electrodynamic vacuum===

{{main|QED vacuum}}

The oldest and best known quantized force field is the [[electromagnetic field]]. [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell's]] [[Maxwell's equations|equations]] have been superseded by [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED). By considering the zero-point energy that arises from QED it is possible to gain a characteristic understanding of zero-point energy that arises not just through electromagnetic interactions but in all [[quantum field theories]].

====Redefining the zero of energy====
In the quantum theory of the electromagnetic field, classical wave amplitudes {{mvar|α}} and {{math|''α''*}} are replaced by operators {{mvar|a}} and {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;}} that satisfy:

:&lt;math&gt;\left[a,a^\dagger\right] = 1&lt;/math&gt;

The classical quantity {{math|{{abs|''α''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} appearing in the classical expression for the energy of a field mode is replaced in quantum theory by the photon number operator {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;''a''}}. The fact that:

:&lt;math&gt;\left[a,a^\dagger a\right] \ne 1&lt;/math&gt;

implies that quantum theory does not allow states of the radiation field for which the photon number and a field amplitude can be precisely defined, i.e., we cannot have simultaneous eigenstates for {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;''a''}} and {{mvar|a}}. The reconciliation of wave and particle attributes of the field is accomplished via the association of a probability amplitude with a classical mode pattern. The calculation of field modes is entirely classical problem, while the quantum properties of the field are carried by the mode "amplitudes" {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{mvar|a}} associated with these classical modes.

The zero-point energy of the field arises formally from the non-commutativity of {{mvar|a}} and {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This is true for any harmonic oscillator: the zero-point energy {{math|{{sfrac|''ħω''|2}}}} appears when we write the Hamiltonian:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
H_{cl} &amp;= \frac{p^2}{2m} + \tfrac{1}{2} m \omega^2 {p}^2 \\
&amp;= \tfrac{1}{2} \hbar \omega \left(a a^\dagger + a^\dagger a\right) \\
&amp;=\hbar \omega \left(a^\dagger a +\tfrac{1}{2}\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

It is often argued that the entire universe is completed bathed in the zero-point electromagnetic field, and as such it can add only some constant amount to expectation values. Physical measurements will therefore reveal only deviations from the vacuum state. Thus the zero-point energy can be dropped from the Hamiltonian by redefining the zero of energy, or by arguing that it is a constant and therefore has no effect on Heisenberg equations of motion. Thus we can choose to declare by fiat that the ground state has zero energy and a field Hamiltonian, for example, can be replaced by:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
H_F - \left\langle 0|H_F|0\right\rangle &amp;=\tfrac{1}{2} \hbar \omega \left(a a^\dagger + a^\dagger a\right)-\tfrac{1}{2}\hbar \omega \\
&amp;= \hbar \omega \left(a^\dagger a + \tfrac{1}{2} \right)-\tfrac{1}{2}\hbar \omega \\
&amp;= \hbar \omega a^\dagger a
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

without affecting any physical predictions of the theory. The new Hamiltonian is said to be [[Normal order|normally ordered]] (or Wick ordered) and is denoted by a double-dot symbol. The normally ordered Hamiltonian is denoted {{math|:''H&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, i.e.:

:&lt;math&gt;:H_F : \equiv \hbar \omega \left(a a^\dagger + a^\dagger a\right) : \equiv \hbar \omega a^\dagger a&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, within the normal ordering symbol we can commute {{mvar|a}} and {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Since zero-point energy is intimately connected to the non-commutativity of {{mvar|a}} and {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the normal ordering procedure eliminates any contribution from the zero-point field. This is especially reasonable in the case of the field Hamiltonian, since the zero-point term merely adds a constant energy which can be eliminated by a simple redefinition for the zero of energy. Moreover, this constant energy in the Hamiltonian obviously commutes with {{mvar|a}} and {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;}} and so cannot have any effect on the quantum dynamics described by the Heisenberg equations of motion.

However, things are not quite that simple. The zero-point energy cannot be eliminated by dropping its energy from the Hamiltonian: When we do this and solve the Heisenberg equation for a field operator, we must include the vacuum field, which is the homogeneous part of the solution for the field operator. In fact we can show that the vacuum field is essential for the preservation of the commutators and the formal consistent of [[Quantum electrodynamics|QED]]. When we calculate the field energy we obtain not only a contribution from particles and forces that may be present but also a contribution from the vacuum field itself i.e. the zero-point field energy. In other words, the zero-point energy reappears even though we may have deleted it from the Hamiltonian.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Milonni|1994|pp=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The electromagnetic field in free space====
From Maxwell's equations, the electromagnetic energy of a "free" field i.e. one with no sources, is described by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
H_F &amp;= \frac{1}{8\pi}\int d^3r \left(\mathbf{E}^2 +\mathbf{B}^2\right) \\
&amp;=\frac{k^2}{2\pi}|\alpha (t)|^2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

We introduce the "mode function" {{math|'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;('''r''')}} that satisfies the Helmholtz equation:

:&lt;math&gt; \left( \nabla^2 + k^2 \right) \mathbf{A}_0(\mathbf{r}) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''k'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''ω''|''c''}}}} and assume it is normalized such that:

:&lt;math&gt;\int d^3r \left|\mathbf{A}_0(\mathbf{r})\right|^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;

We wish to "quantize" the electromagnetic energy of free space for a multimode field. The field intensity of free space should be independent of position such that {{math|{{abs|'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;('''r''')}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} should be independent of {{math|'''r'''}} for each mode of the field. The mode function satisfying these conditions is:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A}_0(\mathbf{r}) = e_{\mathbf{k}}e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''k''' · '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} in order to have the transversality condition {{math|'''∇''' · '''A'''('''r''',''t'')}} satisfied for the Coulomb gauge{{dubious|date=May 2018}} in which we are working.

To achieve the desired normalization we pretend space is divided into cubes of volume {{math|''V'' {{=}} ''L''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} and impose on the field the periodic boundary condition:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}(x+L,y+L,z+L,t)=\mathbf{A}(x,y,z,t)&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently

:&lt;math&gt; \left(k_x,k_y,k_z\right)=\frac{2\pi}{L}\left(n_x,n_y,n_z\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|n}} can assume any integer value. This allows us to consider the field in any one of the imaginary cubes and to define the mode function:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}_\mathbf{k}(\mathbf{r})= \frac{1}\sqrt{V} e_{\mathbf{k}}e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

which satisfies the Helmholtz equation, transversality, and the "box normalization":

:&lt;math&gt;\int_V d^3r \left|\mathbf{A}_\mathbf{k}(\mathbf{r})\right|^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is chosen to be a unit vector which specifies the polarization of the field mode. The condition {{math|'''k''' · ''e''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} means that there are two independent choices of {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which we call {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''2&lt;/sub&gt;}} where {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''1&lt;/sub&gt; · ''e''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''e''{{su|b='''k'''1|p=2}} {{=}} ''e''{{su|b='''k'''2|p=2}} {{=}} 1}}. Thus we define the mode functions:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(\mathbf{r})=\frac{1}\sqrt{V}e_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} \, , \quad \lambda = \begin{cases} 1\\2 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

in terms of which the vector potential becomes{{clarify|date=May 2018}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(\mathbf{r},t)=\sqrt{\frac{2\pi\hbar c^2}{\omega_k V}}\left[a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(0)e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}+a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}^\dagger(0)e^{-i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}\right]e_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

or:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(\mathbf{r},t)=\sqrt{\frac{2\pi\hbar c^2}{\omega_k V}}\left[a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(0)e^{-i(\omega_k t-\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r})}+a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}^\dagger(0)e^{i(\omega_k t-\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r})}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''ω&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''kc''}} and {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''''λ''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''a''{{su|b='''k'''''λ''|p=†}}}} are photon annihilation and creation operators for the mode with wave vector {{mvar|k}} and polarization {{mvar|λ}}. This gives the vector potential for a plane wave mode of the field. The condition for {{math|(''k&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''k&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''k&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} shows that there are infinitely many such modes. The linearity of Maxwell's equations allows us to write:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r}t)=\sum_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi\hbar c^2}{\omega_k V}}\left[a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(0)e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}+a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}^\dagger(0)e^{-i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}\right]e_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

for the total vector potential in free space. Using the fact that:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_V d^3r \mathbf{A}_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(\mathbf{r})\cdot \mathbf{A}_{\mathbf{k}'\lambda'}^\ast(\mathbf{r})=\delta_{\mathbf{k},\mathbf{k}'}^3\delta_{\lambda,\lambda'}&lt;/math&gt;

we find the field Hamiltonian is:

:&lt;math&gt;H_F=\sum_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}\left(\hbar\omega_k\left(a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}^\dagger a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}\right) + \tfrac{1}{2}\right )&lt;/math&gt;

This is the Hamiltonian for an infinite number of uncoupled harmonic oscillators. Thus different modes of the field are independent and satisfy the commutation relations:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left[a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(t),a_{\mathbf{k}'\lambda'}^\dagger(t)\right]&amp;=\delta_{\mathbf{k},\mathbf{k}'}^3\delta_{\lambda,\lambda'} \\[10px]
\left[a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(t),a_{\mathbf{k}'\lambda'}(t)\right]&amp;=\left[a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}^\dagger(t),a_{\mathbf{k}'\lambda'}^\dagger(t)\right]=0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly the least eigenvalue for {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}\tfrac{1}{2}\hbar\omega_k&lt;/math&gt;

This state describes the zero-point energy of the vacuum. It appears that this sum is divergent – in fact highly divergent, as putting in the density factor

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{8\pi v^2 dv}{c^3}V&lt;/math&gt;

shows. The summation becomes approximately the integral:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{4\pi h V}{c^3}\int v^3 \, dv&lt;/math&gt;

for high values of {{mvar|v}}. It diverges proportional to {{math|''v''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} for large {{mvar|v}}.

There are two separate questions to consider. First, is the divergence a real one such that the zero-point energy really is infinite? If we consider the volume {{mvar|V}} is contained by perfectly conducting walls, very high frequencies can only be contained by taking more and more perfect conduction. No actual method of containing the high frequencies is possible. Such modes will not be stationary in our box and thus not countable in the stationary energy content. So from this physical point of view the above sum should only extend to those frequencies which are countable; a cut-off energy is thus eminently reasonable. However, on the scale of a "universe" questions of general relativity must be included. Suppose even the boxes could be reproduced, fit together and closed nicely by curving spacetime. Then exact conditions for running waves may be possible. However the very high frequency quanta will still not be contained. As per John Wheeler's "geons"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=John Archibald|title=Geons|journal=Physical Review|date=1955|volume=97|issue=2|page=511|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.97.511|bibcode=1955PhRv...97..511W}}&lt;/ref&gt; these will leak out of the system. So again a cut-off is permissible, almost necessary. The question here becomes one of consistency since the very high energy quanta will act as a mass source and start curving the geometry.

This leads to the second question. Divergent or not, finite or infinite, is the zero-point energy of any physical significance? The ignoring of the whole zero-point energy is often encouraged for all practical calculations. The reason for this is that energies are not typically defined by an arbitrary data point, but rather changes in data points, so adding or subtracting a constant (even if infinite) should to be allowed. However this is not the whole story, in reality energy is not so arbitrarily defined: in general relativity the seat of the curvature of spacetime is the energy content and there the absolute amount of energy has real physical meaning. There is no such thing as an arbitrary additive constant with density of field energy. Energy density curves space, and an increase in energy density produces an increase of curvature. Furthermore, the zero-point energy density has other physical consequences e.g. the Casimir effect, contribution to the Lamb shift, or anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, it is clear it is not just a mathematical constant or artifact that can be cancelled out.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Power|1964|pp=31–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Necessity of the vacuum field in QED====
The vacuum state of the "free" electromagnetic field (that with no sources) is defined as the ground state in which {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''''λ''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} for all modes {{math|('''k''', ''λ'')}}. The vacuum state, like all stationary states of the field, is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian but not the electric and magnetic field operators. In the vacuum state, therefore, the electric and magnetic fields do not have definite values. We can imagine them to be fluctuating about their mean value of zero.

In a process in which a photon is annihilated (absorbed), we can think of the photon as making a transition into the vacuum state. Similarly, when a photon is created (emitted), it is occasionally useful to imagine that the photon has made a transition out of the vacuum state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dirac|first1=Paul A. M.|title=The Quantum Theory of the Emission and Absorption of Radiation|journal=Proc. Roy. Soc.|date=1927|volume=A114|issue=767|pages=243–265|doi=10.1098/rspa.1927.0039|url=http://www.imotiro.org/repositorio/howto/artigoshistoricosordemcronologica/1927%20-%20DIRAC%201927%20First%20steps%20in%20quantum%20field%20theory%20Invention%20of%20the%20second%20quantization%20method.pdf|accessdate=17 October 2016|bibcode=1927RSPSA.114..243D}}&lt;/ref&gt; An atom, for instance, can be considered to be "dressed" by emission and reabsorption of "virtual photons" from the vacuum. The vacuum state energy described by {{math|∑&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''''λ''&lt;/sub&gt; {{sfrac|''ħω&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''|2}}}} is infinite. We can make the replacement:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}\longrightarrow\sum_{\lambda}\left (\frac{1}{2\pi} \right )^3 \int d^3 k = \frac{V}{8\pi^3} \sum_\lambda \int d^3 k&lt;/math&gt;

the zero-point energy density is:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{1}{V}\sum_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}\tfrac{1}{2}\hbar\omega_k &amp;=\frac{2}{8\pi^3}\int d^3 k \tfrac{1}{2}\hbar\omega_k \\
&amp;= \frac{4\pi}{4\pi^3} \int dk\,k^2 \left(\tfrac{1}{2}\hbar\omega_k\right) \\
&amp;=\frac{\hbar}{2\pi^2 c^3} \int d\omega\,\omega^3
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

or in other words the spectral energy density of the vacuum field:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_0(\omega)=\frac{\hbar\omega^3}{8\pi^2c^3}&lt;/math&gt;

The zero-point energy density in the frequency range from {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} to {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\omega_1}^{\omega_2} d\omega\rho_0(\omega) = \frac{\hbar}{8\pi^2c^3}\left(\omega_2^4-\omega_1^4\right)&lt;/math&gt;

This can be large even in relatively narrow "low frequency" regions of the spectrum. In the optical region from 400 to 700&amp;nbsp;nm, for instance, the above equation yields around 220&amp;nbsp;erg/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

We showed in the above section that the zero-point energy can be eliminated from the Hamiltonian by the normal ordering prescription. However, this elimination does not mean that the vacuum field has been rendered unimportant or without physical consequences. To illustrate this point we consider a linear dipole oscillator in the vacuum. The Hamiltonian for the oscillator plus the field with which it interacts is:

:&lt;math&gt;H=\frac{1}{2m}\left(\mathbf{p}-\frac{e}{c}\mathbf{A}\right)^2 + \tfrac{1}{2}m\omega_0^2\mathbf{x}^2 + H_F&lt;/math&gt;

This has the same form as the corresponding classical Hamiltonian and the Heisenberg equations of motion for the oscillator and the field are formally the same as their classical counterparts. For instance the Heisenberg equations for the coordinate {{math|'''x'''}} and the canonical momentum {{math|'''p''' {{=}} ''m'''''ẋ''' +{{sfrac|''e'''''A'''|''c''}}}} of the oscillator are:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{\dot{x}}&amp;=(i\hbar)^{-1}[\mathbf{x}.H] = \frac{1}{m}\left(\mathbf{p}-\frac{e}{c}\mathbf{A}\right) \\
\mathbf{\dot{p}}&amp;=(i\hbar)^{-1}[\mathbf{p}.H] 
\begin{align}&amp;=\tfrac{1}{2}\nabla\left(\mathbf{p}-\frac{e}{c}\mathbf{A}\right)^2-m\omega_0^2\mathbf{\dot{x}} \\
&amp;=-\frac{1}{m} \left[\left(\mathbf{p}-\frac{e}{c}\mathbf{A}\right) \cdot \nabla\right] \left[-\frac{e}{c}\mathbf{A}\right] - \frac{1}{m} \left(\mathbf{p}-\frac{e}{c}\mathbf{A}\right) \times \nabla \times \left[-\frac{e}{c}\mathbf{A}\right] -m\omega_0^2 \mathbf{\dot{x}} \\
&amp;= \frac{e}{c}(\mathbf{\dot{x}}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{A} + \frac{e}{c}\mathbf{\dot{x}} \times \mathbf{B} -m\omega_0^2 \mathbf{\dot{x}} 
\end{align}\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

or:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
m \mathbf{\ddot{x}} &amp;= \mathbf{\dot{p}} - \frac{e}{c} \mathbf{\dot{A}} \\
&amp;= -\frac{e}{c} \left[\mathbf{\dot{A}} - \left(\mathbf{\dot{x}} \cdot \nabla\right) \mathbf{A}\right] + \frac{e}{c} \mathbf{\dot{x}} \times \mathbf{B} - m\omega_0^2\mathbf{x} \\
&amp;= e\mathbf{E} + \frac{e}{c} \mathbf{\dot{x}} \times \mathbf{B} - m\omega_0^2\mathbf{x}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

since the rate of change of the vector potential in the frame of the moving charge is given by the convective derivative

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\dot{A}}=\frac{\partial\mathbf{A}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{\dot{x}} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{A}^3 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

For nonrelativistic motion we may neglect the magnetic force and replace the expression for {{math|''m'''''ẍ'''}} by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{\ddot{x}}+\omega_0^2\mathbf{x} 
&amp;\approx \frac{e}{m}\mathbf{E} \\
&amp;\approx \sum_{\mathbf{k}\lambda} 
\sqrt{\frac{2\pi\hbar\omega_k}{V}} \left[a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(t) + a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}^\dagger(t)\right] e_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
 
Above we have made the electric dipole approximation in which the spatial dependence of the field is neglected. The Heisenberg equation for {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''''λ''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is found similarly from the Hamiltonian to be:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{a}_{\mathbf{k}\lambda} = i \omega_k a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda} + ie \sqrt\frac{2\pi}{\hbar \omega_k V} \mathbf{\dot{x}} \cdot e_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

In the electric dipole approximation.

In deriving these equations for {{math|'''x'''}}, {{math|'''p'''}}, and {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''''λ''&lt;/sub&gt;}} we have used the fact that equal-time particle and field operators commute. This follows from the assumption that particle and field operators commute at some time (say, {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}}) when the matter-field interpretation is presumed to begin, together with the fact that a Heisenberg-picture operator {{math|''A''(''t'')}} evolves in time as {{math|''A''(''t'') {{=}} ''U''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;(''t'')''A''(0)''U''(''t'')}}, where {{math|''U''(''t'')}} is the time evolution operator satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;i\hbar\dot{U} = HU \,,\quad U^\dagger(t) = U^{-1}(t) \,,\quad U(0) = 1 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, we can argue that these operators must commute if we are to obtain the correct equations of motion from the Hamiltonian, just as the corresponding Poisson brackets in classical theory must vanish in order to generate the correct Hamilton equations. The formal solution of the field equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(t)=a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(0)e^{-i\omega_{k}t}+ie \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{\hbar \omega_k V}} \int^t_0dt'\,e_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}\cdot\mathbf{\dot{x}}(t')e^{i\omega_k\left(t'-t\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore the equation for {{math|''ȧ''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''''λ''&lt;/sub&gt;}} may be written:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\ddot{x}}+\omega^2_0\mathbf{x}=\frac{e}{m}\mathbf{E}_0(t)+\frac{e}{m}\mathbf{E}_{RR}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}_0(t)=i\sum_{\mathbf{k}\lambda} \sqrt{\frac{2\pi\hbar \omega_k}{V}}\left[a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(0)e^{-i\omega_kt}-a^\dagger_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(0)e^{i\omega_kt}\right]e_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

and:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}_{RR}(t)=-\frac{4\pi e}{V} \sum_{\mathbf{k}\lambda} \int^t_0dt'\left[e_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}\cdot\mathbf{\dot{x}}\left(t'\right)\right]\cos\omega_k\left(t'-t\right)&lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown that in the [[Abraham–Lorentz force|radiation reaction]] field, if the mass {{mvar|m}} is regarded as the "observed" mass then we can take:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}_{RR}(t)=\frac{2e}{3c^3}\mathbf{\ddot{x}}&lt;/math&gt;

The total field acting on the dipole has two parts, {{math|'''E'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}} and {{math|'''E'''&lt;sub&gt;''RR''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}}. {{math|'''E'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}} is the free or zero-point field acting on the dipole. It is the homogeneous solution of the Maxwell equation for the field acting on the dipole, i.e., the solution, at the position of the dipole, of the wave equation

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\nabla^2-\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}\right]\mathbf{E}=0&lt;/math&gt;

satisfied by the field in the (source free) vacuum. For this reason {{math|'''E'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}} is often referred to as the "vacuum field", although it is of course a Heisenberg-picture operator acting on whatever state of the field happens to be appropriate at {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}}. {{math|'''E'''&lt;sub&gt;''RR''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}} is the source field, the field generated by the dipole and acting on the dipole.

Using the above equation for {{math|'''E'''&lt;sub&gt;''RR''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}} we obtain an equation for the Heisenberg-picture operator &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt; that is formally the same as the classical equation for a linear dipole oscillator:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{\ddot{x}} + \omega^2_0\mathbf{x}-\tau \mathbf{\overset{...}{x}}=\frac{e}{m}\mathbf{E}_0(t)
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''τ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|2''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|3''mc''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}. in this instance we have considered a dipole in the vacuum, without any "external" field acting on it. the role of the external field in the above equation is played by the vacuum electric field acting on the dipole.

Classically, a dipole in the vacuum is not acted upon by any "external" field: if there are no sources other than the dipole itself, then the only field acting on the dipole is its own radiation reaction field. In quantum theory however there is always an "external" field, namely the source-free or vacuum field {{math|'''E'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}}.

According to our earlier equation for {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''''λ''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}} the free field is the only field in existence at {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}} as the time at which the interaction between the dipole and the field is "switched on". The state vector of the dipole-field system at {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}} is therefore of the form

:&lt;math&gt;|\Psi\rangle=|\text{vac}\rangle|\psi_D\rangle \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|{{!}}vac⟩}} is the vacuum state of the field and {{math|{{!}}''ψ&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;''⟩}} is the initial state of the dipole oscillator. The expectation value of the free field is therefore at all times equal to zero:

:&lt;math&gt;\langle\mathbf{E}_0(t)\rangle=\langle\Psi|\mathbf{E}_0(t)|\Psi\rangle=0&lt;/math&gt;

since {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''''λ''&lt;/sub&gt;(0){{!}}vac⟩ {{=}} 0}}. however, the energy density associated with the free field is infinite:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{1}{4\pi} \left\langle \mathbf{E}^2_0(t) \right\rangle &amp;= \frac{1}{4\pi} \sum_{\mathbf{k}\lambda} \sum_{\mathbf{k'}\lambda'} \sqrt{\frac{2\pi\hbar \omega_k}{V}} \sqrt{\frac{2\pi\hbar \omega_{k'}}{V}} \times \left\langle a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(0)a^\dagger_{\mathbf{k'}\lambda'}(0)\right\rangle \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{4\pi}\sum_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}\left (\frac{2\pi\hbar \omega_k}{V} \right )\\
&amp;= \int^\infin_0dw\,\rho_0(\omega)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The important point of this is that the zero-point field energy {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;''}} does not affect the Heisenberg equation for {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''''λ''&lt;/sub&gt;}} since it is a c-number or constant (i.e. an ordinary number rather than an operator) and commutes with {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''''λ''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. We can therefore drop the zero-point field energy from the Hamiltonian, as is usually done. But the zero-point field re-emerges as the homogeneous solution for the field equation. A charged particle in the vacuum will therefore always see a zero-point field of infinite density. This is the origin of one of the infinities of quantum electrodynamics, and it cannot be eliminated by the trivial expedient dropping of the term {{math|∑&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''''λ''&lt;/sub&gt; {{sfrac|''ħω&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''|2}}}} in the field Hamiltonian.

The free field is in fact necessary for the formal consistency of the theory. In particular, it is necessary for the preservation of the commutation relations, which is required by the unitary of time evolution in quantum theory:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left[z(t),p_z(t)\right]&amp;=\left[U^\dagger(t)z(0)U(t),U^\dagger(t)p_z(0)U(t)\right]\\
&amp;=U^\dagger(t)\left[z(0),p_z(0)\right]U(t)\\
&amp;=i\hbar U^\dagger(t)U(t)\\
&amp;=i\hbar
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

We can calculate {{math|[''z''(''t''),''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'')]}} from the formal solution of the operator equation of motion

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\ddot{x}} + \omega^2_0\mathbf{x}-\tau \mathbf{\overset{...}{x}}=\frac{e}{m}\mathbf{E}_0(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Using the fact that

:&lt;math&gt;\left[a_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}(0),a^\dagger_{\mathbf{k'}\lambda'}(0)\right]=\delta^3_\mathbf{kk'},\delta_{\lambda\lambda'}&lt;/math&gt;

and that equal-time particle and field operators commute, we obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
[z(t),p_z(t)]&amp;=\left[z(t),m\dot{z}(t)\right]+\left[z(t),\frac{e}{c}A_z(t)\right] \\
&amp;=\left[z(t),m\dot{z}(t)\right] \\
&amp;= \left (\frac{i\hbar e^2}{2\pi^2mc^3} \right ) \left (\frac{8\pi}{3} \right ) \int^\infin_0\frac{d\omega\,\omega^4}{\left(\omega^2-\omega^2_0\right)^2+\tau^2\omega^6} 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For the dipole oscillator under consideration it can be assumed that the radiative damping rate is small compared with the natural oscillation frequency, i.e., {{math|''τω''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ≪ 1}}. Then the integrand above is sharply peaked at {{math|''ω'' {{=}} ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left[z(t),p_z(t)\right]&amp;\approx \frac{2i\hbar e^2}{3\pi mc^3}\omega^3_0 \int^\infin_{-\infin} \frac{dx}{x^2 + \tau^2\omega^6_0} \\
&amp;= \left (\frac{2i\hbar e^2 \omega^3_0}{3\pi mc^3} \right )\left (\frac{\pi}{\tau\omega^3_0} \right ) \\
&amp;=i\hbar
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

the necessity of the vacuum field can also be appreciated by making the small damping approximation in

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;\mathbf{\ddot{x}} + \omega^2_0\mathbf{x}-\tau \mathbf{\overset{...}{x}}=\frac{e}{m}\mathbf{E}_0(t) \\
&amp;\mathbf{\ddot{x}}\approx-\omega^2_0\mathbf{x}(t) &amp;&amp; \mathbf{\overset{...}{x}}\approx-\omega^2_0\mathbf{\dot{x}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\ddot{x}}+\tau\omega^2_0\mathbf{\dot{x}}+\omega^2_0\mathbf{x}\approx\frac{e}{m}\mathbf{E}_0(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Without the free field {{math|'''E'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}} in this equation the operator {{math|'''x'''(''t'')}} would be exponentially dampened, and commutators like {{math|[''z''(''t''),''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'')]}} would approach zero for {{math|''t'' ≫ {{sfrac|1|''τω''{{su|p=2|b=0}}}}}}. With the vacuum field included, however, the commutator is {{math|''iħ''}} at all times, as required by unitarity, and as we have just shown. A similar result is easily worked out for the case of a free particle instead of a dipole oscillator.&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milonni|first1=P.W.|authorlink1=Peter W. Milonni|title=Radiation reaction and the nonrelativistic theory of the electron|journal=Physics Letters A|date=1981|volume=82|issue=5|pages=225–226|doi=10.1016/0375-9601(81)90191-2|bibcode=1981PhLA...82..225M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What we have here is an example of a "fluctuation-dissipation elation". Generally speaking if a system is coupled to a bath that can take energy from the system in an effectively irreversible way, then the bath must also cause fluctuations. The fluctuations and the dissipation go hand in hand we cannot have one without the other. In the current example the coupling of a dipole oscillator to the electromagnetic field has a dissipative component, in the form of the zero-point (vacuum) field; given the existence of radiation reaction, the vacuum field must also exist in order to preserve the canonical commutation rule and all it entails.

The spectral density of the vacuum field is fixed by the form of the radiation reaction field, or vice versa: because the radiation reaction field varies with the third derivative of {{math|'''x'''}}, the spectral energy density of the vacuum field must be proportional to the third power of {{mvar|ω}} in order for {{math|[''z''(''t''),''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'')]}} to hold. In the case of a dissipative force proportional to {{math|'''ẋ'''}}, by contrast, the fluctuation force must be proportional to &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; in order to maintain the canonical commutation relation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt; This relation between the form of the dissipation and the spectral density of the fluctuation is the essence of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The fact that the canonical commutation relation for a harmonic oscillator coupled to the vacuum field is preserved implies that the zero-point energy of the oscillator is preserved. it is easy to show that after a few damping times the zero-point motion of the oscillator is in fact sustained by the driving zero-point field.&lt;ref name="ReferenceG"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Senitzky|first1=I.

===The quantum chromodynamic vacuum===

{{main|QCD vacuum}}

The QCD vacuum is the [[vacuum state]] of [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD). It is an example of a ''[[non-perturbative]]'' vacuum state, characterized by a non-vanishing [[condensate (quantum field theory)|condensate]]s such as the [[gluon condensate]] and the [[quark condensate]] in the complete theory which includes quarks. The presence of these condensates characterizes the confined phase of [[quark matter]]. In technical terms, gluons are [[Vector boson|vector]] [[gauge boson]]s that mediate [[strong interaction]]s of [[quark]]s in [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD). Gluons themselves carry the [[color charge]] of the strong interaction. This is unlike the [[photon]], which mediates the [[Electromagnetic force|electromagnetic interaction]] but lacks an electric charge. Gluons therefore participate in the strong interaction in addition to mediating it, making QCD significantly harder to analyze than QED ([[quantum electrodynamics]]) as it deals with [[nonlinear equation]]s to characterize such interactions.

===The Higgs field===

{{main|Higgs mechanism}}

[[File:Mecanismo de Higgs PH.png|thumb|The potential for the Higgs field, plotted as function of {{math|''ϕ''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''ϕ''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. It has a ''Mexican-hat'' or ''champagne-bottle profile'' at the ground.]]
The Standard Model hypothesises a field called the Higgs field (symbol: {{mvar|ϕ}}), which has the unusual property of a non-zero amplitude in its ground state (zero-point) energy after renormalization; i.e., a non-zero vacuum expectation value. It can have this effect because of its unusual "Mexican hat" shaped potential whose lowest "point" is not at its "centre". Below a certain extremely high energy level the existence of this non-zero vacuum expectation [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously breaks]] [[electroweak]] [[gauge symmetry]] which in turn gives rise to the Higgs mechanism and triggers the acquisition of mass by those particles interacting with the field. The Higgs mechanism occurs whenever a charged field has a vacuum expectation value. This effect occurs because scalar field components of the Higgs field are "absorbed" by the massive bosons as degrees of freedom, and couple to the fermions via Yukawa coupling, thereby producing the expected mass terms. The expectation value of {{math|''ϕ''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}} in the ground state (the [[vacuum expectation value]] or VEV) is then {{math|⟨''ϕ''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;⟩ {{=}} {{sfrac|''v''|{{sqrt|2}}}}}}, where {{math|''v'' {{=}} {{sfrac|{{abs|''μ''}}|{{sqrt|''λ''}}}}}}. The measured value of this parameter is approximately {{val|246|u=GeV/c2}}.&lt;ref name="PDGreview2012"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has units of mass, and is the only free parameter of the Standard Model that is not a dimensionless number.

The Higgs mechanism is a type of [[superconductivity]] which occurs in the vacuum. It occurs when all of space is filled with a sea of particles which are charged and thus the field has a nonzero vacuum expectation value. Interaction with the vacuum energy filling the space prevents certain forces from propagating over long distances (as it does in a superconducting medium; e.g., in the [[Ginzburg–Landau theory]]).

==Experimental observations==
Zero-point energy has many observed physical consequences.&lt;ref name="harvp|Milonni|1994|p=111"/&gt; It is important to note that zero-point energy is not merely an artefact of mathematical formalism that can, for instance, be dropped from a Hamiltonian by redefining the zero of energy, or by arguing that it is a constant and therefore has no effect on Heisenberg equations of motion without latter consequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Milonni|1994|pp=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, such treatment could create a problem at a deeper, as of yet undiscovered, theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peskin|first1=Michael E.|last2=Schroeder|first2=Daniel V.|title=An Introduction To Quantum Field Theory|date=1995|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=9780201503975|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in general relativity the zero of energy (i.e. the energy density of the vacuum) contributes to a cosmological constant of the type introduced by Einstein in order to obtain static solutions to his field equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Milonni|2009|p=865}}&lt;/ref&gt; The zero-point energy density of the vacuum, due to all quantum fields, is extremely large, even when we cut off the largest allowable frequencies based on plausible physical arguments. It implies a cosmological constant larger than the limits imposed by observation by about 120 orders of magnitude. This "cosmological constant problem" remains one of the greatest unsolved mysteries of physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abbott|first1=Larry|title=The Mystery of the Cosmological Constant|journal=Scientific American|date=1988|volume=258|issue=5|page=82|url=http://pages.erau.edu/~reynodb2/blog/Abbott_CosmologicalConstant_SciAm.pdf|bibcode=1988SciAm.258e..82A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casimir effect===
[[File:Casimir plates.svg|thumb|Casimir forces on parallel plates]]
{{main|Casimir effect}}

A phenomenon that is commonly presented as evidence for the existence of zero-point energy in vacuum is the [[Casimir effect]], proposed in 1948 by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[physicist]] [[Hendrik Casimir]], who considered the quantized [[electromagnetic field]] between a pair of grounded, neutral metal plates. The vacuum energy contains contributions from all wavelengths, except those excluded by the spacing between plates. As the plates draw together, more wavelengths are excluded and the vacuum energy decreases. The decrease in energy means there must be a force doing work on the plates as they move.

Early experimental tests from the 1950s onwards gave positive results showing the force was real, but other external factors could not be ruled out as the primary cause, with the range of experimental error sometimes being nearly 100%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Derjaguin|first1=B.

===Lamb shift===

{{main|Lamb shift}}

The quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field have important physical consequences. In addition to the Casimir effect, they also lead to a splitting between the two [[energy level]]s {{math|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''S''&lt;sub&gt;{{sfrac|1|2}}&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''P''&lt;sub&gt;{{sfrac|1|2}}&lt;/sub&gt;}} (in [[term symbol]] notation) of the [[hydrogen atom]] which was not predicted by the [[Dirac equation]], according to which these states should have the same energy. Charged particles can interact with the fluctuations of the quantized vacuum field, leading to slight shifts in energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Itzykson|Zuber|1980|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; this effect is called the Lamb shift.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift of about {{val|4.38|e=-6|u=eV}} is roughly {{val|e=-7}} of the difference between the energies of the 1s and 2s levels, and amounts to 1,058&amp;nbsp;MHz in frequency units. A small part of this shift (27&amp;nbsp;MHz ≈ 3%) arises not from fluctuations of the electromagnetic field, but from fluctuations of the electron–positron field. The creation of (virtual) electron–positron pairs has the effect of screening the Coulomb field and acts as a vacuum dielectric constant. This effect is much more important in muonic atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Le Bellac|first1=Michael|title=Quantum Physics|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107602762|page=381|edition=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fine structure constant===

{{main|fine structure constant}}

Taking {{mvar|ħ}} ([[Planck's constant]] divided by {{math|2π}}), {{mvar|c}} (the [[speed of light]]), and {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|''q''{{su|b=''e''|p=2}}|4π''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} (the electromagnetic [[coupling constant]] i.e. a measure of the strength of the [[electromagnetic force]] (where {{math|''q&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the absolute value of the [[Electron charge|electronic charge]] and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity]])) we can form a dimensionless quantity called the [[fine-structure constant]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{e^2}{\hbar c} = \frac{q_e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0\hbar c} \approx \frac{1}{137}&lt;/math&gt;

The fine-structure constant is the coupling constant of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED) determining the strength of the interaction between electrons and photons. It turns out that the fine structure constant is not really a constant at all owing to the zero-point energy fluctuations of the electron-positron field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Le Bellac|first1=Michael|title=Quantum Physics|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9781107602762|page=33|edition=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quantum fluctuations caused by zero-point energy have the effect of screening electric charges: owing to (virtual) electron-positron pair production, the charge of the particle measured far from the particle is far smaller than the charge measured when close to it.

The Heisenberg inequality where {{math|''ħ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''h''|2π}}}}, and {{math|Δ&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|Δ&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the standard deviations of position and momentum states that:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_x\Delta_p\ge\frac{1}{2}\hbar&lt;/math&gt;

It means that a short distance implies large momentum and therefore high energy i.e. particles of high energy must be used to explore short distances. QED concludes that the fine structure constant is an increasing function of energy. It has been shown that at energies of the order of the [[Z boson|Z&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; boson]] rest energy, {{math|''m&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≈}} 90&amp;nbsp;GeV, that:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha\approx\frac{1}{129}&lt;/math&gt;

rather than the low-energy {{math|''α'' ≈ {{sfrac|1|137}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aitchison|first1=Ian|last2=Hey|first2=Anthony|title=Gauge Theories in Particle Physics: A Practical Introduction: Volume 1: From Relativistic Quantum Mechanics to QED|date=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781466512993|page=343|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quigg|first1=C|editor1-last=Espriu|editor1-first=D|editor2-last=Pich|editor2-first=A|title=Advanced School on Electroweak Theory: Hardon Colliders, the Top Quark, and the Higgs Sector|date=1998|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=9789814545143|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; The renormalization procedure of eliminating zero-point energy infinities allows the choice of an arbitrary energy (or distance) scale for defining {{mvar|α}}. All in all, {{mvar|α}} depends on the energy scale characteristic of the process under study, and also on details of the renormalization procedure. The energy dependence of {{mvar|α}} has been observed for several years now in precision experiment in high-energy physics.

===Vacuum birefringence===
{{main|Lorentz-violating electrodynamics|Euler–Heisenberg Lagrangian}}
[[File:Eso1641a.ogg|thumb|Light coming from the surface of a strongly magnetic [[neutron star]] (left) becomes linearly polarised as it travels through the vacuum.]]
In the presence of strong electrostatic fields it is predicted that virtual particles become separated from the vacuum state and form real matter. The fact that electromagnetic radiation can be transformed into matter and vice versa leads to fundamentally new features in [[quantum electrodynamics]]. One of the most important consequences is that, even in the vacuum, the Maxwell equations have to be exchanged by more complicated formulas. In general, it will be not possible to separate processes in the vacuum from the processes involving matter since electromagnetic fields can create matter if the field fluctuations are strong enough. This leads to highly complex nonlinear interaction -  gravity will have an effect on the light at the same time the light has an effect on gravity. These effects were first predicted by [[Werner Heisenberg]] and [[Hans Heinrich Euler]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Heisenberg|Euler|1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1936 and independently the same year by [[Victor Weisskopf]] who stated: "The physical properties of the vacuum originate in the “zero-point energy” of matter, which also depends on absent particles through the external field strengths and therefore contributes an additional term to the purely Maxwellian field energy".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Weisskopf|1936|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Greiner|Müller|Rafelski|2012|p=278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus strong magnetic fields vary the energy contained in the vacuum. The scale above which the electromagnetic field is expected to become nonlinear is known as the [[Schwinger limit]]. At this point the vacuum has all the properties of a [[Birefringence|birefringent medium]], thus in principle a rotation of the polarization frame (the [[Faraday effect]]) can be observed in empty space.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Greiner|Müller|Rafelski|2012|p=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Dunne|2012}} for a historical review of the subject.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wide field view of the sky around the very faint neutron star RX J1856.5-3754.jpg|thumb|left|Wide field view of the neutron star [[RX J1856.5-3754]]]]
Both Einstein's theory of special and general relativity state that light should pass freely through a vacuum without being altered, a principle known as [[Lorentz invariance]]. Yet, in theory, large nonlinear self-interaction of light due to quantum fluctuations should lead to this principle being measurably violated if the interactions are strong enough. Nearly all theories of [[quantum gravity]] predict that that Lorentz invariance is not an exact symmetry of nature.  It is predicted the speed at which light travels through the vacuum depends on its direction, polarization and the local strength of the magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Heyl|Shaviv|2000|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been a number of inconclusive results which claim to show evidence of a [[Modern searches for Lorentz violation|Lorentz violation]] by finding a rotation of the polarization plane of light coming from distant galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Carroll|Field|1997}} and {{harvs|txt|last1=Kostelecký|last2=Mewes|year1=2009|year2=2013}} for an overview of this area.&lt;/ref&gt; The first concrete evidence for vacuum birefringence was published in 2017 when a team of [[astronomers]] looked at the light coming from the star [[RX J1856.5-3754]],&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Mignani et al.|2017}} for experiment and {{harvp|Cho|2016}}, {{harvp|Crane|2016}} and {{harvp|Bennett|2016}} for comment.&lt;/ref&gt; the closest discovered [[neutron star]] to [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rees|2012|p=528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberto Mignani at the [[National Institute for Astrophysics]] in [[Milan]] who led the team of [[astronomers]] has commented that "“When Einstein came up with the theory of general relativity 100 years ago, he had no idea that it would be used for navigational systems. The consequences of this discovery probably will also have to be realised on a longer timescale.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Crane|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team found that visible light from the star had undergone linear polarisation{{clarify|date=May 2018}} of around 16%. If the birefringence had been caused by light passing through [[interstellar gas]] or plasma, the effect should have been no more than 1%. Definitive proof would require repeating the observation at other wavelengths and on other neutron stars. At [[X-ray]] wavelengths the polarization from the quantum fluctuations should be near 100%.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cho|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although no [[telescope]] currently exists that can make such measurements, there are several proposed X-ray telescopes that may soon be able to verify the result conclusively such as China's [[Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope]] (HXMT) and NASA's Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE).

In the late 1990s it was discovered that very distant [[supernova]] were dimmer than expected suggesting that the universe's expansion was accelerating rather than slowing down.&lt;ref name="riess"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Adam Riess|Riess, Adam G.]]|year=1998|title=Observational evidence from supernovae for an accelerating universe and a cosmological constant|journal=Astronomical Journal|volume=116|issue=3|pages=1009–38|arxiv=astro-ph/9805201 |doi=10.1086/300499|bibcode=1998AJ....116.1009R|last2=Filippenko|last3=Challis|last4=Clocchiatti|last5=Diercks|last6=Garnavich|last7=Gilliland|last8=Hogan|last9=Jha|last10=Kirshner|last11=Leibundgut|last12=Phillips|last13=Reiss|last14=Schmidt|last15=Schommer|last16=Smith|last17=Spyromilio|last18=Stubbs|last19=Suntzeff|last20=Tonry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="perlmutter"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Saul Perlmutter|Perlmutter, S.]] |journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=517|issue=2|pages=565–86|year=1999|title=Measurements of Omega and Lambda from 42 high redshift supernovae|arxiv=astro-ph/9812133 |doi=10.1086/307221|bibcode=1999ApJ...517..565P|last2=Aldering|last3=Goldhaber|last4=Knop|last5=Nugent|last6=Castro|last7=Deustua|last8=Fabbro|last9=Goobar|last10=Groom|last11=Hook|last12=Kim|last13=Kim|last14=Lee|last15=Nunes|last16=Pain|last17=Pennypacker|last18=Quimby|last19=Lidman|last20=Ellis|last21=Irwin|last22=McMahon|last23=Ruiz Lapuente|last24=Walton|last25=Schaefer|last26=Boyle|last27=Filippenko|last28=Matheson|last29=Fruchter|last30=Panagia}}&lt;/ref&gt; This revived discussion that Einstein's [[cosmological constant]], long disregarded by physicists as being equal to zero, was in fact some small positive value. This would indicate empty space exerted some form of [[Negative energy|negative pressure or energy]].

There is no natural candidate for what might cause what has been called [[dark energy]] but the current best guess is that it is the zero-point energy of the vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Amit|first1=Gilead|title=Our Implausible Unvierse|journal=New Scientist|date=2016|volume=232|issue=3097|page=35|url=https://www.newscientist.com/issue/3097/}}&lt;/ref&gt; One difficulty with this assumption is that the zero-point energy of the vacuum is absurdly large compared to the observed cosmological constant. In [[general relativity]], [[mass]] and energy are equivalent; both produce a gravitational field and therefore the theorized vacuum energy of quantum field theory should have led the universe ripping itself to pieces. This obviously has not happened and this issue, called the [[cosmological constant problem]], is one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in physics.

The [[European Space Agency]] is building the [[Euclid (spacecraft)|Euclid telescope]]. Due to launch in 2020 it will map galaxies up to 10 billion light years away. By seeing how dark energy influences their arrangement and shape, the mission will allow scientists to see if the strength of dark energy has changed. If dark energy is found to vary throughout time it would indicate it is due to [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]], where observed acceleration is due to the energy of a [[scalar field]], rather than the cosmological constant. No evidence of quintessence is yet available, but it has not been ruled out either. It generally predicts a slightly slower acceleration of the expansion of the universe than the cosmological constant. Some scientists think that the best evidence for quintessence would come from violations of Einstein's [[equivalence principle]] and [[equivalence principle#Tests of the Einstein equivalence principle|variation of the fundamental constants]] in space or time.&lt;ref name="Carroll1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carroll|first1=Sean M.|title=Quintessence and the Rest of the World: Suppressing Long-Range Interactions|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=81|issue=15|year=1998|pages=3067–3070|issn=0031-9007|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.3067|arxiv = astro-ph/9806099 |bibcode = 1998PhRvL..81.3067C |url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/356711/files/9806099.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scalar field]]s are predicted by the ''[[Standard Model]] of particle physics'' and [[string theory]], but an analogous problem to the cosmological constant problem (or the problem of constructing models of [[cosmological inflation]]) occurs: [[renormalization]] theory predicts that scalar fields should acquire large masses again due to zero-point energy.

===Cosmic inflation===
{{unsolved|physics|Why does the observable universe have more matter than antimatter?}}
{{main|Inflation (cosmology)}}

[[Cosmic inflation]] is a faster-than-light expansion of space just after the [[Big Bang]]. It explains the origin of the [[Observable universe#Large-scale structure|large-scale structure of the cosmos]]. It is believed [[quantum vacuum fluctuations]] caused by zero-point energy arising in the microscopic inflationary period, later became magnified to a cosmic size, becoming the gravitational seeds for galaxies and structure in the Universe (see [[galaxy formation and evolution]] and [[structure formation]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, Neil deGrasse and Donald Goldsmith (2004), ''Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution'', W. W. Norton &amp; Co., pp. 84–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Many physicists also believe that inflation explains why the Universe appears to be the same in all directions ([[isotropic]]), why the [[cosmic microwave background]] radiation is distributed evenly, why the Universe is flat, and why no [[magnetic monopole]]s have been observed.

The mechanism for inflation is unclear, it is similar in effect to dark energy but is a far more energetic and short lived process. As with dark energy the best explanation is some form of vacuum energy arising from quantum fluctuations. It may be that inflation caused [[baryogenesis]], the hypothetical physical processes that produced an [[symmetry|asymmetry]] (imbalance) between [[baryon]]s and antibaryons produced in the [[Big Bang|very early universe]], but this is far from certain.

==Alternative theories==
There has been a long debate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Enz|first1=Charles P.|editor1-last=Enz|editor1-first=C. P.|editor2-last=Mehra|editor2-first=J.|title=Physical Reality and Mathematical Description Is the Zero-Point Energy Real?|date=1974|publisher=D.

[[Julian Schwinger|Schwinger]], in particular, attempted to formulate QED without reference to zero-point fluctuations via his "source theory".&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvs|txt|last1=Schwinger|year1=1998a|year2=1998b|year3=1998c}}&lt;/ref&gt; From such an approach it is possible to derive the Casimir Effect without reference to a fluctuating field. Such a derivation was first given by Schwinger (1975)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwinger|first1=Julian|title=Casimir effect in source theory|journal=Letters in Mathematical Physics|date=1975|volume=1|issue=1|pages=43–47|doi=10.1007/BF00405585|bibcode=1975LMaPh...1...43S}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a scalar field, and then generalized to the electromagnetic case by Schwinger, DeRaad, and Milton (1978).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwinger|first1=Julian|last2=DeRaad|first2=Lester L.|last3=Milton|first3=Kimball A.|title=Casimir effect in dielectrics|journal=Annals of Physics|date=1978|volume=115|issue=1|pages=1–23|doi=10.1016/0003-4916(78)90172-0|bibcode=1978AnPhy.115....1S}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they state "the vacuum is regarded as truly a state with all physical properties equal to zero". More recently [[Robert Jaffe|Jaffe]] (2005)&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Jaffe |first=R. L.|year=2005|title=Casimir effect and the quantum vacuum|journal=[[Physical Review D]]|volume=72 |issue=2 |page=021301|arxiv= hep-th/0503158|bibcode= 2005PhRvD..72b1301J|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.72.021301}}&lt;/ref&gt; has highlighted a similar approach in deriving the Casimir effect stating "the concept of zero-point fluctuations is a heuristic and calculational aid in the description of the Casimir effect, but not a necessity in QED."

Nevertheless, as Jaffe himself notes in his paper, "no one has shown that source theory or another S-matrix based approach can provide a complete description of QED to all orders." Furthermore, [[Peter W. Milonni|Milonni]] has shown the necessity of the vacuum field for the formal consistency of QED.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Milonni|1994|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[QCD]], [[color confinement]] has led physicists to abandon the source theory or [[S-matrix]] based approach for the [[strong interactions]]. The [[Higgs mechanism]], [[Hawking Radiation]] and the [[Unruh effect]] are also theorized to be dependent on zero-point vacuum fluctuations, the field contribution being an inseparable parts of these theories. Jaffe continues "Even if one could argue away zero-point contributions to the quantum vacuum energy, the problem of spontaneous symmetry breaking remains: condensates [ground state vacua] that carry energy appear at many energy scales in the Standard Model. So there is good reason to be skeptical of attempts to avoid the standard formulation of quantum field theory and the zero-point energies it brings with it." It is difficult to judge the physical reality of infinite zero-point energies that are inherent in field theories, but modern physics does not know any better way to construct gauge-invariant, renormalizable theories than with zero-point energy and they would seem to be a necessity for any attempt at a [[Grand Unified Theory|unified theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Greiner|Müller|Rafelski|2012|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A good example of nonlinear electromagnetics is in high energy dense plasmas, where [[Vortex|vortical phenomena]] occur which seemingly violate the [[second law of thermodynamics]] by increasing the energy gradient within the electromagnetic field and violate [[Maxwell's laws]] by creating ion currents which capture and concentrate their own and surrounding magnetic fields.

One may query what this has to do with zero-point energy. Given the complex and adaptive behaviour that arises from nonlinear systems considerable attention in recent years has gone into studying a new class of [[phase transition]]s which occur at absolute zero temperature. These are quantum phase transitions which are driven by EM field fluctuations as a consequence of zero-point energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kais|first1=Sabre|editor1-last=Popelier|editor1-first=Paul|title=Finite Size Scaling for Criticality of the Schrodinger Equation: Solving the Schrodinger Equation: Has Everything Been Tried?|date=2011|publisher=Imperial College Press|location=Singapore|isbn=978-1-84816-724-7|pages=91–92|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFK7CgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good example of a spontaneous phase transition that are attributed to zero-point fluctuations can be found in [[superconductor]]s. Superconductivity is one of the best known empirically quantified macroscopic electromagnetic phenomena whose basis is recognised to be quantum mechanical in origin. The behaviour of the electric and magnetic fields under superconductivity is governed by the [[London equations]]. However, it has been questioned in a series of journal articles whether the quantum mechanically canonised London equations can be given a purely classical derivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Classical Physics Makes a Comeback|publisher=The Times|date=Jan 14, 1982|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bostick,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bostick|first1=W.|title=Controversy over whether classical systems like plasmas can behave like superconductors (which have heretofore been supposed to be strictly quantum-mechanically dominated)|journal=International Journal of Fusion Energy|date=1985|volume=3|issue=2|pages=47–51|url=https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:17042212|issn=0146-4981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bostick|first1=W.|title=The morphology of the electron|journal=International Journal of Fusion Energy|date=1985|volume=3|issue=1|pages=9–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, has claimed to show that the London equations do indeed have a classical origin that applies to superconductors and to some collisionless plasmas as well.

The idea that the vacuum energy can have multiple stable energy states is a leading hypothesis for the cause of [[cosmic inflation]]. In fact, it has been argued that these early vacuum fluctuations led to the expansion of the universe and in turn have guaranteed the non-equilibrium conditions necessary to drive order from chaos, as without such expansion the universe would have reached thermal equilibrium and no complexity could have existed. With the continued accelerated expansion of the universe, the cosmos generates an energy gradient that increases the "free energy" (i.e. the available, usable or potential energy for useful work) which the universe is able to utilize to create ever more complex forms of order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Chaisson|first1=Eric J.|title=Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics in an Energy-Rich Universe|pages=21–31|doi=10.1007/11672906_2|isbn=978-3-540-22495-2|series=Understanding Complex Systems|year=2005|chapter=2 Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics in an Energy-Rich Universe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaisson|first1=Eric J.|title=Cosmic Evolution: The Rise of Complexity in Nature|date=2002|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674009875|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KG2SZouhFuIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only reason Earth's environment does not decay into an equilibrium state is that it receives a daily dose of sunshine and that, in turn, is due to the sun "polluting" interstellar space with decreasing entropy. The sun's fusion power is only possible due to the gravitational disequilibrium of matter that arose from cosmic expansion. In this essence, the vacuum energy can be viewed as the key cause of the negative entropy (i.e. structure) throughout the universe. That humanity might alter the morphology of the vacuum energy to create an energy gradient for useful work is the subject of much controversy.

==Purported applications==

Physicists overwhelmingly reject any possibility that the zero-point energy field can be exploited to obtain useful energy ([[work (physics)|work]]) or uncompensated momentum; such efforts are seen as tantamount to [[perpetual motion machine]]s.

Nevertheless, the allure of free energy has motivated such research, usually falling in the category of [[fringe science]]. As long ago as 1889 (before quantum theory or discovery of the zero point energy) [[Nikola Tesla]] proposed that useful energy could be obtained from free space, or what was assumed at that time to be an all-pervasive [[Aether (classical element)|aether]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=I|title=Peeking inside an electron's screen|journal=Science News|date=1997|volume=151|page=89|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/physics-5|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have since claimed to exploit zero-point or vacuum energy with a large amount of [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] literature causing ridicule around the subject.&lt;ref name=army&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[U.S. Army]] [[National Ground Intelligence Center]]|url=http://info.publicintelligence.net/USArmy-ZeroPointEnergy.pdf|title=Zero-Point Energy: Can We Get Something From Nothing?|author=Amber M.

===Casimir batteries and engines===
A common assumption is that the Casimir force is of little practical use; the argument is made that the only way to actually gain energy from the two plates is to allow them to come together (getting them apart again would then require more energy), and therefore it is a one-use-only tiny force in nature.&lt;ref name=army/&gt; In 1984 [[Robert L.

The battery can be recharged by making the electrical forces slightly stronger than the Casimir force to reexpand the plates.

When they brought a metallized sphere close up to the plate, the attractive Casimir force between the two objects made the plate rotate. They also studied the dynamical behaviour of the MEMS device by making the plate oscillate. The Casimir force reduced the rate of oscillation and led to nonlinear phenomena, such as [[hysteresis]] and [[bistability]] in the frequency response of the oscillator. According to the team, the system’s behaviour agreed well with theoretical calculations.

Despite this and several similar peer reviewed papers, there is not a consensus as to whether such devices can produce a continuous output of work. Garret Moddel at [[University of Colorado Boulder|University of Colorado]] has highlighted that he believes such devices hinge on the assumption that the Casimir force is a [[Conservative force|nonconservative force]], he argues that there is sufficient evidence (e.g. analysis by Scandurra (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Scandurra|first1=M.|title=Thermodynamic properties of the quantum vacuum|eprint=hep-th/0104127|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to say that the Casimir effect is a conservative force and therefore even though such an engine can exploit the Casimir force for useful work it cannot produce more output energy than has been input into the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Moddel|first1=Garret|title=Assessment of proposed electromagnetic quantum vacuum energy extraction methods|eprint=0910.5893|class=cond-mat.stat-mech|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 patent by Haisch and Moddel&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|7379286}}&lt;/ref&gt; details a device that is able to extract power from zero-point fluctuations using a gas that circulates through a Casimir cavity. As gas atoms circulate around the system they enter the cavity. Upon entering the electrons spin down to release energy via electromagnetic radiation. This radiation is then extracted by an absorber.

===Single heat baths===
In 1951 [[Herbert Callen|Callen]] and Welton&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; proved the quantum [[fluctuation-dissipation theorem]] (FDT) which was originally formulated in classical form by [[Harry Nyquist|Nyquist]] (1928)&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; as an explanation for observed [[Johnson noise]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt; in electric circuits. Fluctuation-dissipation theorem showed that when something dissipates energy, in an effectively irreversible way, a connected heat bath must also fluctuate. The fluctuations and the dissipation go hand in hand; it is impossible to have one without the other. The implication of FDT being that the vacuum could be treated as a heat bath coupled to a dissipative force and as such energy could, in part, be extracted from the vacuum for potentially useful work.&lt;ref name="harvp|Milonni|1994|p=54"/&gt; Such a theory has met with resistance: Macdonald (1962)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacDonald|first1=D.K.C.|title=On Brownian Movement and irreversibility|journal=Physica|date=1962|volume=28|issue=4|pages=409–416|doi=10.1016/0031-8914(62)90019-8|bibcode=1962Phy....28..409M}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Harris (1971)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harris|first1=I.

===Space travel and gravitational shielding===
The use of zero-point energy for space travel is highly speculative. A complete [[Theory of everything|quantum theory of gravitation]] (that would deal with the role of quantum phenomena like zero-point energy) does not yet exist.

Most serious scientific research in this area depends on the theorized anti-gravitational properties of [[antimatter]] (currently being tested at the [[Antiproton Decelerator|alpha experiment]] at [[CERN]]) and/or the effects of non-Newtonian forces such as the [[gravitomagnetic field]] under specific quantum conditions.

Since all atoms have [[Spin (physics)|spin]], gravitational permeability may be able to differ from material to material. A strong [[toroid]]al gravitational field that acts against the force of gravity could be generated by materials that have [[Chaos theory|nonlinear properties]] that enhance time-varying gravitational fields.

In 2002 [[Phantom Works]], [[Boeing]]'s advanced research and development facility in [[Seattle]], approached [[Evgeny Podkletnov]] directly. Phantom Works was blocked by Russian technology transfer controls. At this time Lieutenant General George Muellner, the outgoing head of the Boeing Phantom Works, confirmed that attempts by Boeing to work with Podkletnov had been blocked by Moscow, also commenting that "The physical principles – and Podkletnov's device is not the only one – appear to be valid... There is basic science there. They're not breaking the laws of physics. The issue is whether the science can be engineered into something workable"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cook|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They used fluid dynamic simulations to model the interaction of a vehicle (like that proposed by Alcubierre) with the zero-point field. Vacuum field perturbations are simulated by fluid field perturbations and the aerodynamic resistance of viscous drag exerted on the interior of the vehicle is compared to the Lorentz force exerted by the zero-point field (a Casimir-like force is exerted on the exterior by unbalanced zero-point radiation pressures). They find that the optimized negative energy required for an Alcubierre drive is where it is a saucer-shaped vehicle with [[toroid]]al electromagnetic fields. The EM fields distort the vacuum field perturbations surrounding the craft sufficiently to affect the permeability and permittivity of space.

While peer review doesn’t guarantee that a finding or observation is valid, it does indicate that independent scientists looked over the experimental setup, results, and interpretation and that they could not find any obvious errors in the methodology and that they found the results reasonable. In the paper, the authors identify and discuss nine potential sources of experimental errors, including rogue air currents, leaky electromagnetic radiation, and magnetic interactions. Not all of them could be completely ruled out, and further peer reviewed experimentation is needed in order to rule these potential errors out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Drake|first1=Nadia|last2=Greshko|first2=Michael|title=NASA Team Claims ‘Impossible’ Space Engine Works—Get the Facts|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/11/nasa-impossible-emdrive-physics-peer-review-space-science/|accessdate=22 November 2016|publisher=National Geographic|date=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7052">In [[combustion]], the '''Williams spray equation''', also known as the '''Williams–Boltzmann equation''', describes the statistical evolution of sprays contained in another fluid, analogous to the [[Boltzmann equation]] for the molecules, named after [[Forman A. Williams]], who derived the equation in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, F. A. "Spray combustion and atomization." The physics of fluids 1.6 (1958): 541–545&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, F. A. (1961, January). Progress in spray-combustion analysis. In Symposium (international) on Combustion (Vol. 8, No. 1, pp. 50-69). Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical description&lt;ref&gt;Williams, FA. "Combustion theory." (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;==
The sprays are assumed to be spherical with radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, even though the assumption is valid for solid particles(liquid droplets) when their shape has no consequence on the combustion. For liquid droplets to be nearly spherical, the spray has to be dilute(total volume occupied by the sprays is much less than the volume of the gas) and the [[Weber number]] &lt;math&gt;We = 2r\rho_g|\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{u}|^2/\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\rho_g&lt;/math&gt; is the gas density, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is the spray droplet velocity, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; is the gas velocity and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the surface tension of the liquid spray, should be &lt;math&gt;We \ll 10&lt;/math&gt;.

The equation is described by a number density function &lt;math&gt;f_j(r,\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v},T,t) \, dr \, d\mathbf{x} \, d\mathbf{v}\,dT&lt;/math&gt;, which represents the probable number of spray particles (droplets) of chemical species &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; (of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; total species), that one can find with radii between &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r+dr&lt;/math&gt;, located in the spatial range between &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}+d\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;, traveling with a velocity in between &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}+d\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;, having the temperature in between &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T+dT&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Then the spray equation for the evolution of this density function is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f_j}{\partial t} + \nabla_x\cdot(\mathbf{v}f_j) + \nabla_v \cdot(F_jf_j) =- \frac{\partial }{\partial r}(R_jf_j) - \frac{\partial }{\partial T}(E_jf_j) + Q_j + \Gamma_j, \quad j = 1,2,\ldots,M. &lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;F_j = \left(\frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt}\right)_j&lt;/math&gt; is the force per unit mass acting on the &lt;math&gt;j^\text{th}&lt;/math&gt; species spray (acceleration applied to the sprays),

:&lt;math&gt;R_j=\left(\frac{dr}{dt}\right)_j&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of change of the size of the &lt;math&gt;j^\text{th}&lt;/math&gt; species spray,

:&lt;math&gt;E_j=\left(\frac{dT}{dt}\right)_j&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of change of the temperature of the &lt;math&gt;j^\text{th}&lt;/math&gt; species spray due to heat transfer,&lt;ref&gt;Oguz Emre, Damien Kah, St´ephane Jay, Quang-Huy Tran, Anthony Velghe, et al.. Eulerian Moment Methods for Automotive Sprays. Atomization and Sprays, Begell House Inc., 2015, 25 (3), pp. 189–254&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Q_j&lt;/math&gt;  is the rate of change of number density function of &lt;math&gt;j^\text{th}&lt;/math&gt; species spray due to nucleation, liquid breakup etc.,

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_j&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of change of number density function of &lt;math&gt;j^\text{th}&lt;/math&gt; species spray due to collision with other spray particles.

==A simplified model for liquid propellant rocket==
This model for the rocket motor was developed by Probert,&lt;ref&gt;Probert, R. P. "XV. The influence of spray particle size and distribution in the combustion of oil droplets." The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science 37.265 (1946): 94–105.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Forman A. Williams|Williams]]&lt;ref&gt;Williams, F. A. "Spray combustion and atomization." The physics of fluids 1.6 (1958): 541-545&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, F. A. "Introduction to Analytical Models of High Frequency Combustion Instability,”." Eighth Symposium (International) on Combustion. Williams and Wilkins. 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; and Tanasawa.&lt;ref&gt;Tanasawa, Y. "On the Combustion Rate of a Group of Fuel Particles Injected Through a Swirl Nozzle." Technology Reports of Tohoku University 18 (1954): 195–208.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tanasawa, Yasusi, and Tuneo Tesima. "On the theory of combustion rate of liquid fuel spray." Bulletin of JSME 1.1 (1958): 36–41.&lt;/ref&gt; It is reasonable to neglect &lt;math&gt;Q_j, \ \Gamma_j&lt;/math&gt;, for distances not very close to the spray atomizer, where major portion of combustion occurs. Consider a one-dimensional liquid-propellent rocket motor situated at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;, where fuel is sprayed. Neglecting &lt;math&gt;E_j&lt;/math&gt;(density function is defined without the temperature so accordingly dimensions of &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; changes) and due to the fact that the mean flow is parallel to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis, the steady spray equation reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial }{\partial r}(R_jf_j) + \frac{\partial }{\partial x}(u_j f_j) + \frac{\partial }{\partial u_j}(F_jf_j) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u_j&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; direction. Integrating with respect to the velocity results

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial }{\partial r}\left(\int R_j f_j \, d u_j \right) + \frac{\partial }{\partial x} \left(\int u_j f_j \, d u_j \right) + [F_jf_j]_0^\infty =0&lt;/math&gt;

The contribution from the last term (spray acceleration term) becomes zero (using [[Divergence theorem]]) since &lt;math&gt;f_j\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is very large, which is typically the case in rocket motors. The drop size rate &lt;math&gt;R_j&lt;/math&gt; is well modeled using vaporization mechanisms as

:&lt;math&gt;R_j = -\frac{\chi_j}{r^{k_j}}, \quad \chi_j \geq 0, \quad 0\leq k_j \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\chi_j&lt;/math&gt; is independent of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, but can depend on the surrounding gas. Defining the number of droplets per unit volume per unit radius and average quantities averaged over velocities,

:&lt;math&gt;G_j = \int f_j \, du_j, \quad \bar{R}_j = \frac{\int R_j f_j \, d u_j}{G_j}, \quad \bar{u}_j = \frac{\int u_j f_j \, d u_j}{G_j}&lt;/math&gt;

the equation becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial }{\partial r}(\bar{R}_jG_j) + \frac{\partial }{\partial x}(\bar{u}_j G_j) =0.&lt;/math&gt;

If further assumed that &lt;math&gt;\bar{u}_j&lt;/math&gt; is independent of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, and with a transformed coordinate

&lt;math&gt;\eta_j = \left[r^{k_j+1} + (k_j+1) \int_0^x \frac{\chi_j}{\bar{u}_j} \, dx \right]^{1/(k_j+1)}&lt;/math&gt;

If the combustion chamber has varying cross-section area &lt;math&gt;A(x)&lt;/math&gt;, a known function for &lt;math&gt;x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and with area &lt;math&gt;A_o&lt;/math&gt; at the spraying location, then the solution is given by

:&lt;math&gt;G_j(\eta_j) = G_{j,o}(\eta_j)\frac{A_o \bar{u}_{j,o}}{A\bar{u}_j} \left(\frac{r}{\eta_j}\right)^{k_j}&lt;/math&gt;.

where &lt;math&gt;G_{j,0} = G_j(r,0), \ \bar{u}_{j,0} = \bar{u}_j(x=0)&lt;/math&gt; are the number distribution and mean velocity at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

It's a philosophical statement that pertains to the philosophy of science and doesn't meet consensus among philosophers.

A '''physical law''' or a '''law of [[physics]]''' is a statement "[[inferred]] from particular facts, applicable to a defined group or class of [[phenomena]], and expressible by the statement that a particular phenomenon always occurs if certain conditions be present."&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Law of nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical laws are typically conclusions based on repeated scientific [[experiment]]s and [[observations]] over many years and which have become accepted universally within the [[scientific community]]. The production of a summary description of our environment in the form of such laws is a fundamental aim of [[science]]. These terms are not used the same way by all authors.

The distinction between [[natural law]] in the political-legal sense and law of nature or physical law in the scientific sense is a modern one, both concepts being equally derived from ''[[physis]]'', the Greek word (translated into Latin as ''natura'') for ''nature''.&lt;ref&gt;Some modern philosophers, e.g. [[Norman Swartz]], use "physical law" to mean the laws of nature as they truly are and not as they are inferred by scientists. See Norman Swartz, ''The Concept of Physical Law'' (New York: Cambridge University Press), 1985. Second edition available online [https://www.sfu.ca/philosophy/physical-law/].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

Several general properties of physical laws have been identified. Physical laws are:

* True, at least within their regime of validity. By definition, there have never been repeatable contradicting observations.&lt;!--concept pre-existing in article--&gt;
* Universal. They appear to apply everywhere in the universe.&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davies|first1=Paul|title=The mind of God : the scientific basis for a rational world|date=2005|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=978-0-671-79718-8|edition=1st Simon &amp; Schuster pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}}
* Simple. They are typically expressed in terms of a single mathematical equation.
* Absolute. Nothing in the universe appears to affect them.&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt;{{rp|82}}
* Stable. Unchanged since first discovered (although they may have been shown to be approximations of more accurate laws—see "[[Physical law#Laws as approximations|Laws as approximations]]" below),
* Omnipotent. Everything in the universe apparently must comply with them (according to observations).&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt;{{rp|83}}
* Generally [[Conservation law (physics)|conservative]] of quantity.&lt;ref name=Feynman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feynman|first1=Richard|title=The character of physical law|date=1994|publisher=Modern Library|location=New York|isbn=978-0-679-60127-2|edition=Modern Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|59}}
* Often expressions of existing homogeneities ([[symmetries]]) of [[space]] and time.&lt;ref name=Feynman/&gt;
* Typically theoretically reversible in time (if non-[[quantum mechanics|quantum]]), although [[arrow of time|time itself is irreversible]].&lt;ref name=Feynman/&gt;

== Examples ==
{{main|List of laws in science}}
{{See also|Scientific laws named after people}}

Some of the more famous laws of nature are found in [[Isaac Newton]]'s theories of (now) [[classical mechanics]], presented in his ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', and in [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]]. Other examples of laws of nature include [[Boyle's law]] of gases, [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation laws]], the four laws of [[thermodynamics]], etc.

==Laws as definitions==
Many scientific laws are couched in mathematical terms (e.g. [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Second law]] ''F'' = {{frac|dp|dt}}, or the [[uncertainty principle]], or the [[principle of least action]], or [[causality]]). While these scientific laws explain what our senses perceive, they are still empirical, and so are not "mathematical" laws. (Mathematical laws can be proved purely by mathematics and not by scientific experiment.)

== Laws being consequences of mathematical symmetries==
{{main article|Symmetry (physics)}}
Other laws reflect mathematical symmetries found in Nature (say, [[Pauli exclusion principle]] reflects identity of electrons, conservation laws reflect [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]] of [[space]], time, [[Lorentz transformations]] reflect rotational symmetry of [[spacetime]]). Laws are constantly being checked experimentally to higher and higher degrees of precision. This is one of the main goals of science. Just because laws have never been observed to be violated does not preclude testing them at increased accuracy or in new kinds of conditions to confirm whether they continue to hold, or whether they break, and what can be discovered in the process. It is always possible for laws to be invalidated or proven to have limitations, by repeatable experimental evidence, should any be observed.

Well-established laws have indeed been invalidated in some special cases, but the new formulations created to explain the discrepancies can be said to generalize upon, rather than overthrow, the originals. That is, the invalidated laws have been found to be only close approximations (see below), to which other terms or factors must be added to cover previously unaccounted-for conditions, e.g. very large or very small scales of time or space, enormous speeds or masses, etc. Thus, rather than unchanging knowledge, physical laws are better viewed as a series of improving and more precise generalizations.

Many fundamental physical laws are mathematical consequences of various [[symmetries]] of space, time, or other aspects of nature. Specifically, [[Noether's theorem]] connects some conservation laws to certain symmetries. For example, conservation of energy is a consequence of the shift symmetry of time (no moment of time is different from any other), while conservation of momentum is a consequence of the symmetry (homogeneity) of space (no place in space is special, or different than any other). The indistinguishability of all particles of each fundamental type (say, electrons, or photons) results in the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics|Dirac]] and [[Bose–Einstein statistics|Bose]] quantum statistics which in turn result in the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] for [[fermion]]s and in [[Bose–Einstein condensation]] for [[boson]]s. The rotational symmetry between time and [[space]] coordinate axes (when one is taken as imaginary, another as real) results in [[Lorentz transformations]] which in turn result in [[special relativity]] theory. Symmetry between [[inertial]] and gravitational [[mass]] results in [[general relativity]].

The [[inverse square law]] of interactions mediated by massless bosons is the mathematical consequence of the 3-dimensionality of [[space]].

One strategy in the search for the most fundamental laws of nature is to search for the most general mathematical symmetry group that can be applied to the fundamental interactions.

== Laws as approximations ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Physical law]] --&gt;
Some laws are only approximations of other more general laws, and are good approximations with a restricted domain of applicability. For example, Newtonian dynamics (which is based on Galilean transformations) is the low-speed limit of special relativity (since the Galilean transformation is the low-speed approximation to the Lorentz transformation). Similarly, the Newtonian [[gravitation]] law is a low-mass approximation of general relativity, and Coulomb's law is an approximation to Quantum Electrodynamics at large distances (compared to the range of weak interactions). In such cases it is common to use the simpler, approximate versions of the laws, instead of the more accurate general laws.

== History ==
According to a positivist view, when compared to [[pre-industrial society|pre-modern]] accounts of [[causality]], laws of nature fill the role played by [[causality#Religion and theology|divine causality]] on the one hand, and accounts such as [[Plato]]'s [[theory of forms]] on the other.

The observation that there are underlying regularities in nature dates from [[prehistoric]] times, since the recognition of cause-and-effect relationships is an implicit recognition that there are laws of nature. The recognition of such regularities as independent scientific laws ''[[Per se (phrase)|per se]]'', though, was limited by their entanglement in [[animism]], and by the attribution of many effects that do not have readily obvious causes—such as [[meteorological]], [[astronomical]] and [[biological]] phenomena—to the actions of various [[deity|gods]], [[spirit]]s, [[supernatural being]]s, etc. Observation and speculation about nature were intimately bound up with metaphysics and morality.

In Europe, systematic theorizing about nature (''[[physis]]'') began with the early [[History of science in classical antiquity|Greek philosophers and scientists]] and continued into the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial]] periods, during which times the intellectual influence of Roman law increasingly became paramount.&lt;blockquote&gt;The formula "law of nature" first appears as "a live metaphor" favored by Latin poets [[Lucretius]], [[Virgil]], [[Ovid]], [[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]], in time gaining a firm theoretical presence in the prose treatises of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]. Why this Roman origin? According to [historian and classicist Daryn] Lehoux's persuasive narrative,&lt;ref&gt;in Daryn Lehoux, ''What Did the Romans Know? An Inquiry into Science and Worldmaking'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2012), reviewed by David Sedley, "When Nature Got its Laws", ''Times Literary Supplement'' (12 October 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; the idea was made possible by the pivotal role of codified law and forensic argument in Roman life and culture.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the Romans . . . the place par excellence where ethics, law, nature, religion and politics overlap is the law court. When we read Seneca's [[Naturales quaestiones|''Natural Questions'']], and watch again and again just how he applies standards of evidence, witness evaluation, argument and proof, we can recognize that we are reading one of the great Roman rhetoricians of the age, thoroughly immersed in forensic method. And not Seneca alone. Legal models of scientific judgment turn up all over the place, and for example prove equally integral to [[Ptolemy]]'s approach to verification, where the mind is assigned the role of magistrate, the senses that of disclosure of evidence, and dialectical reason that of the law itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sedley, "When Nature Got Its Laws", ''Times Literary Supplement'' (12 October 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The precise formulation of what are now recognized as modern and valid statements of the laws of nature dates from  the 17th century in Europe, with the beginning of accurate experimentation and development of advanced forms of mathematics.  During this period, [[Natural philosophy|natural philosophers]] such as [[Isaac Newton]] were influenced by a religious view which held that God had instituted absolute, universal and immutable physical laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/24/opinion/24davies.html|title=Taking Science on Faith|last=Davies|first=Paul|date=2007-11-24|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2012/05/08/3498202.htm|title=Christianity and the rise of western science|last=Harrison|first=Peter|date=8 May 2012|website=ABC|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In chapter 7 of ''[[The World (Descartes)|The World]]'', [[René Descartes]] described "nature" as matter itself, unchanging as created by God, thus changes in parts "are to be attributed to nature. The rules according to which these changes take place I call the 'laws of nature'."&lt;ref name="bertie.ccsu.edu7"&gt;{{cite web | title=Cosmological Revolution V: Descartes and Newton | website=bertie.ccsu.edu | url=http://bertie.ccsu.edu/naturesci/Cosmology/Cosmo5Newton.html | accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The modern [[scientific method]] which took shape at this time (with [[Francis Bacon]] and [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]) aimed at total separation of science from theology, with minimal speculation about [[metaphysics]] and ethics. [[Natural law]] in the political sense, conceived as universal (i.e., divorced from sectarian religion and accidents of place), was also elaborated in this period (by [[Grotius]], [[Spinoza]], and [[Hobbes]], to name a few).

== Other fields ==
Some [[Mathematics|mathematical]] [[theorem]]s and [[axiom]]s are referred to as laws because they provide logical foundation to empirical laws.

Examples of other observed phenomena sometimes described as laws include the [[Titius–Bode law]] of planetary positions, [[Zipf's law]] of linguistics, [[Moore's law]] of technological growth. Many of these laws fall within the scope of [[uncomfortable science]]. Other laws are pragmatic and observational, such as the [[law of unintended consequences]]. By analogy, principles in other fields of study are sometimes loosely referred to as "laws". These include [[Occam's razor]] as a principle of philosophy and the [[Pareto principle]] of economics.

'''Many-body theory''' (or '''many-body physics''') is an area of [[physics]] which provides the framework for understanding the collective behavior of large numbers of interacting particles, often on the order of [[Avogadro's number]]. In general terms, many-body theory deals with effects that manifest themselves only in systems containing large numbers of constituents. While the underlying physical laws that govern the motion of each individual particle may (or may not) be simple, the study of the collection of particles can be extremely complex. In some cases [[emergent phenomena]] may arise which bear little resemblance to the underlying elementary laws.

Many-body theory plays a central role in [[condensed matter physics]].

[[File:Airplanstb8.svg|thumb|right|Parallel vertical forces acting on an airplane in straight and level flight.  Lift from the main wing (Pz) is balanced by the weight of the airplane (mg) and the down-force on the horizontal stabilizer (Pzh).]]
In [[mechanical engineering]], a '''parallel force system''' is a situation in which two [[force]]s of equal magnitude act in the same direction [[Coplanarity|within the same plane]], with the counter force in the middle.  An example of this is a [[see saw]].  The children are applying the two forces at the ends, and the [[Lever|fulcrum]] in the middle gives the counter force to maintain the see saw in neutral position.  Another example are the major vertical forces on an [[airplane]] in flight (see image at right).

'''Infinite derivative gravity''' is a [[theory of gravity]] which attempts to remove cosmological and black hole singularities by adding extra terms to the [[Einstein–Hilbert action]], which weaken gravity at short distances.

==History==
In 1987, Krasnikov considered an infinite set of higher derivative terms acting on the curvature terms and showed that by choosing the coefficients wisely, the propagator would be ghost-free and exponentially suppressed in the ultraviolet regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Krasnikov |first1=N. V. |title=Nonlocal gauge theories |journal=Theoretical and Mathematical Physics |date=November 1987 |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=1184–1190 |doi=10.1007/BF01017588|bibcode=1987TMP....73.1184K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tomboulis (1997) later extended this work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=hep-th/9702146 |title=Superrenormalizable gauge and gravitational theories |last1=Tomboulis |first1=E. T |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; By looking at an equivalent scalar-tensor theory, Biswas, [[Anupam Mazumdar|Mazumdar]] and [[Warren Siegel|Siegel]] (2005) looked at bouncing FRW solutions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Bouncing Universes in String-inspired Gravity |journal=Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics |volume=2006 |issue=3 |pages=009 |arxiv=hep-th/0508194 |bibcode=2006JCAP...03..009B |doi=10.1088/1475-7516/2006/03/009 |year=2006 |last1=Biswas |first1=Tirthabir |last2=Mazumdar |first2=Anupam |last3=Siegel |first3=Warren|citeseerx=10.1.1.266.743 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Biswas, Gerwick, Koivisto and Mazumdar demonstrated that the most general infinite derivative action in 4 dimensions, around constant curvature backgrounds, parity invariant and torsion free, can be expressed by:&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv=1110.5249 |title=Towards singularity and ghost free theories of gravity |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=108 |issue=3 |pages=031101 |last1=Biswas |first1=Tirthabir |last2=Gerwick |first2=Erik |last3=Koivisto |first3=Tomi |last4=Mazumdar |first4=Anupam |year=2012 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.031101 |pmid=22400725 |bibcode=2012PhRvL.108c1101B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt; F_i (\Box)=\sum^\infty_{n=0} f_{i_n} \Box/M^2&lt;/math&gt; are functions of the [[D'Alembert operator]] &lt;math&gt;\Box=g^{\mu\nu} \nabla_\mu \nabla_\nu&lt;/math&gt; and a mass scale &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the Ricci scalar, &lt;math&gt;R_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is the Ricci tensor and &lt;math&gt;C_{\mu\nu\lambda\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; is the Weyl tensor.&lt;ref name=Ghostfree&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1308.2319 |title=Generalized ghost-free quadratic curvature gravity |journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=015022 |last1=Biswas |first1=Tirthabir |last2=Conroy |first2=Aindriú |last3=Koshelev |first3=Alexey S. |last4=Mazumdar |first4=Anupam |year=2013 |doi=10.1088/0264-9381/31/1/015022 |bibcode=2014CQGra..31a5022B }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avoid ghosts, the propagator (which is a combination of the &lt;math&gt; F_i (\Box)&lt;/math&gt;s) must be the exponential of an entire function.

===Avoidance of singularities===
This action can produce a bouncing cosmology, by taking a flat [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|FRW metric]] with a scale factor &lt;math&gt;a(t) = \cosh(\sigma t)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;a(t) = e^{\lambda t^2}&lt;/math&gt;, thus avoiding the cosmological singularity problem.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=On bouncing solutions in non-local gravity |first1=A.

A '''camelback potential''' is [[potential energy]] curve that looks like a [[normal distribution]] with a distinct dip where the peak would be, so named because it resembles the humps on a camel's back.  The term was applied to a configuration of a [[superconducting quantum interference device]] in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hoskinson |first=E.|last2=Lecocq|first2=F. |last3=Didier|first3=N.|last4=Fay|first4=A.|last5=Hekking |first5=F.

The latter system consists of two parallel diametric cylindrical magnets, that is, magnets that are magnetized perpendicular to their axis, with the north and south poles located on the curved surface as opposed to either end. When a [[Diamagnetism|diamagnetic]] rod (usually [[graphite]]) is placed between the magnets, it will remain in place and move back and forth in [[simple harmonic motion|harmonic motion]] when disturbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gunawan|first=Oki|last2=Virgus|first2=Yudistira|last3=Tai|first3=Kong Fai|date=2015-02-09|title=A parallel dipole line system |journal=Applied Physics Letters|volume=106|issue=6|pages=062407|doi=10.1063/1.4907931|issn=0003-6951|arxiv=1405.5220|bibcode=2015ApPhL.106f2407G}}&lt;/ref&gt; This arrangement, also known as a "PDL trap" for "parallel dipole line", was the subject of the 2017 International Physics Olympiad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A New Effect in Electromagnetism Discovered – 150 years later |url=https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2017/10/new-effect-electromagnetism/ |website=IBM |date=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the magnetic system, the camelback potential effect only occurs when the length of the diamagnetic rod is between two critical lengths. Below the minimum length, the magnet is hypothesized to align with magnetic field lines, hence not maintaining its orientation and touching the magnet. The maximum length is limited by the distance between the peaks of the camelback humps; thus, a rod longer than that will be unstable and fall out of the trap. Both the radius and the length of the rod determine the damping of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gunawan|first=Oki|last2=Virgus|first2=Yudistira|date=2017-04-04|title=The one-dimensional camelback potential in the parallel dipole line trap: Stability conditions and finite size effect|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=121|issue=13|pages=133902|doi=10.1063/1.4978876|issn=0021-8979|bibcode=2017JAP...121m3902G}}&lt;/ref&gt; The damping is primarily due to [[Stokes' law|Stokes drag]], as damping is non-observable under vacuum.

Possible practical uses of the concept include being a platform for custom-designed 1D potentials, a highly sensitive force-distance transducer or a trap for semiconductor nanowires.

The '''Elitzur–Vaidman bomb-tester''' is a [[quantum mechanics]] [[thought experiment]] that uses [[interaction-free measurement]]s to verify that a bomb is functional without having to detonate it.  It was conceived in 1993 by [[Avshalom Elitzur]] and [[Lev Vaidman]]. Since their publication, real-world experiments have confirmed that their theoretical method works as predicted.&lt;ref name="kwiat1994"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.univie.ac.at/qfp/publications3/pdffiles/1994-08.pdf|

title=Experimental realization of "interaction-free" measurements|
format=pdf|
accessdate=2012-05-07|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bomb tester takes advantage of two characteristics of [[elementary particle]]s, such as [[photon]]s or [[electron]]s: [[Quantum nonlocality|nonlocality]] and [[wave-particle duality]].{{sfn|Elitzur Vaidman|1993|p=988}}  By placing the particle in a [[quantum superposition]], the experiment can verify that the bomb works without ever triggering its detonation, although there is a 50% chance that the bomb will explode in the effort.

==Background==
The bomb test is an [[interaction-free measurement]].  The idea of getting information about an object without interacting with it is not a new one.  For example, there are two boxes, one of which contains something, the other of which contains nothing.  If you open one box and see nothing, you know that the other contains something, without ever opening it.{{Sfn|Elitzur Vaidman|1993|p=988}}

This experiment has its roots in the [[double-slit experiment]] and other, more complex concepts it inspired, including [[Schrodinger's cat]], and [[Wheeler's delayed choice experiment]].{{sfn|Elitzur Vaidman|1993|p=991}}  The behavior of elementary particles is very different from what we experience in our macroscopic world.  They can behave like a [[wave]] or like a [[particle]] (see [[wave–particle duality]]).  When they are in a wave state, they are in what is called a "[[Superposition principle|superposition]]".  In this state, some properties of the particle, for example, its location, are not definite.  While in a superposition, [[Wave theory|any and all possibilities]] are equally real.  So, if it can exist in more than one location, it ''does'' exist in them all{{clarify|reason="it can exist in more than one location" does not necessarily imply "it ''does'' exist in them all".|date=March 2018}}.  The particle's wave can later be "[[Wave function collapse|collapsed]]" by observing it, at which time its location once again becomes definite. Information can then be gleaned not only about the actual state of the particle, but also other states, or locations in which it existed before the collapse.  This is possible even though the particle was never factually in those states or locations.

Consider a collection of light-sensitive [[bomb]]s, of which some are [[dud]]s.  When their triggers detect any light, even a single [[photon]], the light is absorbed and the bomb explodes.  The triggers on the dud bombs have no sensor, so the photon can't be absorbed.&lt;ref name="bowden"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the dud bomb will not detect the photon and will not detonate. Is it possible to determine which bombs are functional and which are duds without detonating all of the live ones?

===Components===
* A light-sensitive bomb: it's not known whether it's live or a dud.
* A photon emitter: it produces a single photon for the purposes of the experiment.
* A photon: after being emitted, it travels through the box below.
* A "box" which contains:
** An initial half-silvered mirror: the photon enters the box when it encounters this "[[beam splitter]]".  The photon will either pass through the mirror and travel along the "lower path" inside the box, or be reflected at a 90-degree angle and travel along the box's "upper path".
** The bomb in question: it's placed inside the box beforehand on the "lower path". If it's live and comes into contact with a photon, it will detonate and destroy itself and the photon.  If, however, the bomb is a dud, the photon passes it by and continues on its way along the lower path.
** A pair of ordinary mirrors: they're located on each path.  They are positioned to redirect the photon so that the two paths intersect one another at the same position as the second beam splitter.
** A second beam splitter identical to the initial one: it's positioned opposite the initial one, at the intersection between the lower path and upper path (after they have been redirected by the ordinary mirrors), at the exit of the box.
* A pair of photon detectors: they're located outside the box, aligned with the second beam-splitter.  The photon can be detected at either or neither, but never both.

===Part 1: The Superposition===
[[File:Test_Illustration_3.png|thumb|right|Figure 3: Once the photon encounters the beam splitter it enters a superposition wherein it both passes through and reflects off the half-silvered mirror]]
A superposition in the bomb tester is created with an angled [[Beam splitter|half-silvered mirror]], which allows a photon to either pass through it, or be reflected off it at a 90-degree angle (see figure 3). There is equal probability it will do either.  The photon enters a superposition, in which it does both.  The single particle both passes through, and is reflected off the half-silvered mirror.  From that moment on, the single photon exists in two different locations.

Along both the upper and lower path, the particle will encounter an ordinary mirror, positioned to redirect the two routes toward one another.  They then intersect at a second half-silvered mirror.  On the other side, a pair of detectors are placed such that the photon can be detected by either detector, but never by both.  It is also possible that it will not be detected by either.  Based on this outcome, with a live bomb, there is a 50% chance it will explode, a 25% chance it will be identified as good without exploding and a 25% chance there will be no result.

===Part 2: The Bomb===
{{see|Cat state}}
[[File:Test_illustration_of_the_bomb.png|thumb|right|Figure 4: If the bomb is live, it will absorb the photon and detonate.  If its a dud, the photon is unaffected and continues along the lower path.]]
[[File:Test_illustration_of_the_bomb2.png|thumb|right|Figure 5 As in Figure 4, the photon travels the lower path toward the bomb, but in a superposition, where it also travels the upper path.]]
A light-sensitive bomb is placed along the lower path.  If the bomb is good, when a photon arrives, it will explode and both will be destroyed.  If it's a dud, the photon will pass by unaffected (see figure 4).  To understand how this experiment works, it is important to know that the bomb is a kind of observer and that this encounter is a kind of observation.  It can therefore collapse the photon's superposition, in which the photon is travelling along both the upper and lower paths.  When it reaches the live bomb, or the detectors, however, it can only have been on one or the other.  But, like the radioactive material in the box with Schrödinger's famous cat, upon its encounter with the half-silvered mirror at the beginning of the experiment, the photon, paradoxically does and does not interact with the bomb.  According to the authors, the bomb both explodes and doesn't explode.{{Sfn|Elitzur Vaidman|1993|p=992}} This is only in the case of a live bomb, however.  In any event, once observed by the detectors, it will have only traveled one of the paths.

===Part 3: The second half-silvered mirror===
[[File:Test_illustration_of_the_interference.png|thumb|right|Figure 6: The second half-silvered mirror and the two detectors are positioned so that the photon will only arrive at Detector C if there is wave interference.  This is only possible if the bomb is a dud.]]
When two [[wave]]s collide, the process by which they affect each other is called [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]].  They can either strengthen each other by "constructive interference", or weaken each other by "destructive interference".&lt;ref name="Feynman"&gt;{{cite book |last= Feynman |first= Richard P. |author2=Robert B. Leighton |author3= Matthew Sands |title= The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol. 3
 |publisher= Addison-Wesley |year= 1965 |location= US |pages= 1.5 |isbn= 978-0201021189}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is true whether the wave is in water, or a single photon in a superposition.  So even though there is only one photon in the experiment, because of its encounter with the half-silvered mirror, it acts like two.  When "it" or "they" are reflected off the ordinary mirrors, it will interfere with itself as if it were two different photons.  ''But that's only true if the bomb is a dud.''  A live bomb will absorb the photon when it explodes and there will be no opportunity for the photon to interfere with itself.

When it reaches the second half-silvered mirror, if the photon in the experiment is behaving like a particle (in other words, if it is not in a superposition), then it has a fifty-fifty chance it will pass through or be reflected and be detected by one or the other detector.  ''But that's only possible if the bomb is live.''  If the bomb "observed" the photon, it detonated and destroyed the photon on the lower path, therefore only the photon that takes the upper path will be detected, either at Detector C or Detector D.

===Part 4: Detector C and Detector D===
[[File:Live_bomb_for_bomb_tester_article_rewrite2.png|thumb|right|Figure 7: If the bomb is live, and the photon took the upper path, there is no chance of interference at the second half-silvered mirror, and so, just as was the case at the first, it has an equal chance of reflecting off it or passing through it and arriving at either detector C or D.  This is the only way it can arrive at D, signifying a live (unexploded) bomb.]]
Detector D is the key to confirming that the bomb is live.

The two detectors and the second half-silvered mirror are precisely aligned with one another.  Detector C is positioned to detect the particle if the bomb is a dud and the particle traveled both paths in its superposition and then constructively interfered with itself.  Detector D is positioned to detect the photon only in the event of destructive interference—an impossibility  (see figure 6).  In other words, if the photon is in a superposition at the time it arrives at the second half-silvered mirror, it will always arrive at detector C and never at detector D.

If the bomb is live, there is a 50/50 chance that the photon took upper path.  If it "factually" did so, then it "counter-factually" took the lower path (see figure 7).  That counter-factual event destroyed that photon and left only the photon on the upper to arrive at the second half-silvered mirror.  At which point it will, again, have a 50/50 chance of passing through it or being reflected off it, and, subsequently, it will be detected at either of the two detectors with the same probability.  This is what makes it possible for the experiment to verify the bomb is live without actually blowing it up.{{Sfn|Elitzur Vaidman|1993|p=990}}

===Results===
With a dud, the photon will always arrive at Detector C.&lt;br&gt;
With a live bomb, there can be three possible outcomes:

# No photon was detected (50% chance).
# The photon was detected at C (25% chance).
# The photon was detected at D (25% chance).

These correspond with the following conditions of the bomb being tested:

'''1. No photon was detected''': The bomb exploded and destroyed the photon before it could be detected.  This is because the photon in fact took the lower path and triggered the bomb, destroying itself in the process.  There is a 50% chance that this will be the outcome if the bomb is live.&lt;br&gt;
'''2. The photon was detected at C''': This will always be the outcome if a bomb is a dud, however, there is a 25% chance that this will be the outcome if the bomb is live.  If the bomb is a dud, this is because the photon remained in its superposition until it reached the second half-silvered mirror and constructively interfered with itself.  If the bomb is live, this is because the photon in fact took the upper path and reflected off the second half-silvered mirror.&lt;br&gt;
'''3. The photon was detected at D''': The bomb is live but unexploded.  That's because the photon in fact took the upper path and passed through the second half-silvered mirror, something possible only because there was no photon from the lower path with which it could interfere.  ''This is the only way that a photon can ever be detected at D.''  If this is the outcome, the experiment has successfully verified that the bomb is live despite the fact that the photon never "factually" encountered the bomb itself.  There is a 25% chance that this will be the outcome if the bomb is live.{{Sfn|Elitzur Vaidman|1993|p=990}}

(Note: The diagram and explanation in Figure 7 unfortunately reverses the positions of detectors C &amp; D with respect to the diagram at the top of the page. The explanation in this section refers to the initial diagram at the top of this page.)

If the result is 2, the experiment is repeated.  If the photon continues to be observed at C and the bomb doesn't explode, it can eventually be concluded that the bomb is a dud.{{Sfn|Elitzur Vaidman|1993|p=994}}

With this process 25% of live bombs can be identified without being detonated, 50% will be detonated and 25% remain uncertain.{{Sfn|Elitzur Vaidman|1993|p=994}} By repeating the process with the uncertain ones, the ratio of identified non-detonated live bombs approaches 33% of the initial population of bombs. See the "[[#Experiments|Experiments]]" section below for a modified experiment that can identify the live bombs with a yield rate approaching 100%.

==Many-worlds interpretation==
The authors point out that the ability to obtain information about the bomb's functionality without ever "touching" it, appears to be a paradox.  That, they claim, is based on the assumption that there is only a single "real" result.{{Sfn|Elitzur Vaidman|1993|p=991}}  But according to the [[many-worlds interpretation]], each possible state of a particle's superposition is real.  Therefore, the particle does actually interact with the bomb and it does explode, just not in our "world".{{Sfn|Elitzur Vaidman|1993|p=992}}

==Experiments==
In 1994, [[Anton Zeilinger]], [[Paul Kwiat]], [[Harald Weinfurter]], and Thomas Herzog actually performed an equivalent of the above experiment, proving interaction-free measurements are indeed possible.{{sfn|Kwiat, et al.|1995|pp=4763-4766}}

In 1996, Kwiat ''et al.'' devised a method, using a sequence of polarising devices, that efficiently increases the yield rate to a level arbitrarily close to one. The key idea is to split a fraction of the photon beam into a large number of beams of very small amplitude and reflect all of them off the mirror, recombining them with the original beam afterwards.{{sfn|Kwiat, et al.|1995|pp=4763-4766}}&lt;ref name=nature&gt;{{cite journal

It can also be argued that this revised construction is simply equivalent to a [[resonant cavity]] and the result looks much less shocking in this language, see Watanabe and Inoue (2000).

In their experiment they perform the “bomb test” with a single atom trapped in a polarization-synthesized optical lattice. This optical lattice enables interaction-free measurements by [[quantum entanglement|entangling]] the [[quantum spin|spin]] and position of atoms.

'''Diffeomorphometry''' is the metric study of imagery, shape and form in the discipline of [[computational anatomy]] (CA) in [[medical imaging]]. The study of images in [[computational anatomy]] rely on high-dimensional [[diffeomorphism]] [[Group (mathematics)|groups]] &lt;math&gt; \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt; which generate orbits of the form  &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{I} \doteq

\{ \varphi \cdot I \mid \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V \} &lt;/math&gt;, in which images &lt;math&gt; I \in \mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt; can be dense scalar [[Magnetic resonance imaging|magnetic resonance]] or [[computed axial tomography]] images. For [[Deformable bodies|deformable shapes]] these are the collection of [[manifold]]s &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M} \doteq

\{ \varphi \cdot M \mid \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V \} &lt;/math&gt;,  points, [[Differential geometry of curves|curves]] and [[Surface (mathematics)|surface]]s. The diffeomorphisms move the images and shapes through the orbit according to &lt;math&gt;(\varphi,I)\mapsto \varphi \cdot I&lt;/math&gt; which are defined as the [[Group actions in computational anatomy|group actions of computational anatomy]].

The orbit of shapes and forms  is made into a metric space by inducing a metric on the group of diffeomorphisms.  &lt;nowiki/&gt;The study of metrics on groups of diffeomorphisms and the study of metrics between manifolds and surfaces has been an area of significant investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=M.

Informally, the [[Metric space|metric]]  is constructed by defining a flow of diffemorphisms &lt;math&gt;\dot \phi_t , t \in [0,1], \phi_t \in \operatorname{Diff}_V&lt;/math&gt; which connect the group elements from one to another, so for &lt;math&gt; \varphi,\psi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\phi_0 = \varphi , \phi_1=\psi&lt;/math&gt;.  The metric between two coordinate systems or diffeomorphisms is then the shortest length or [[Geodesic|geodesic flow]] connecting them. The metric on the space associated to the geodesics is given by&lt;math&gt;\rho(\varphi,\psi) = \inf_{\phi: \phi_0=\varphi,\phi_1 = \psi} \int_0^1 \| \dot \phi_t \|_{\phi_t} \, dt&lt;/math&gt;. The metrics on the orbits &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I},\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;  are inherited from the metric induced on the diffeomorphism group.&lt;nowiki/&gt;

The group &lt;math&gt; \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt; is thusly made into a smooth [[Riemannian manifold]] with Riemannian metric &lt;math&gt; \| \cdot \|_\varphi  &lt;/math&gt;  associated to the tangent spaces at all &lt;math&gt; \varphi \in\operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt;. The  &lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Riemannian metric]] satisfies at every point of the manifold &lt;math&gt; \phi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt; there is an  [[Inner product space|inner product]] inducing the norm  on the [[tangent space]] &lt;math&gt; \| \dot \phi_t  \|_{\phi_t} &lt;/math&gt;  that varies smoothly across &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt;.

Oftentimes, the familiar [[Euclidean distance|Euclidean metric]] is not directly applicable because the patterns of shapes and images don't form a [[vector space]]. In the [[Riemannian Metric and Lie-Bracket Interpretation of the Euler Equation on Geodesics|Riemannian orbit model of Computational anatomy]], diffeomorphisms acting on the forms &lt;math&gt;\varphi \cdot I \in \mathcal {I}, \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V, M \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; don't act linearly. There are many ways to define metrics, and for the sets associated to shapes the [[Hausdorff metric]] is another. The method used to induce the [[Riemannian metric]] is to induce the metric on the orbit of shapes by defining it in terms of the metric length between diffeomorphic coordinate system transformations of the flows. Measuring the lengths of the geodesic flow between coordinates systems in the orbit of shapes is called '''diffeomorphometry'''.

== The diffeomorphisms group generated as Lagrangian and Eulerian flows ==

The diffeomorphisms in [[computational anatomy]] are generated to satisfy the [[Computational anatomy#Lagrangian and Eulerian flows for generating diffeomorphisms|Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow fields]], &lt;math&gt; \varphi_t,  t \in [0,1] &lt;/math&gt;, generated via the ordinary differential equation{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;

\frac{d}{dt} \varphi_t = v_t \circ \varphi_t , \ \varphi_0 = \operatorname{id}; &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Lagrangian flow}}}}

with the Eulerian vector fields &lt;math&gt; v \doteq (v_1,v_2,v_3) &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;  {\mathbb R}^3   &lt;/math&gt;  for &lt;math&gt;v_t = \dot \varphi_t \circ \varphi_t^{-1}, t \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;. The inverse for the flow is given by
&lt;math&gt;
 \frac{d}{dt} \varphi_t^{-1} = -(D \varphi_t^{-1}) v_t, \ \varphi_0^{-1} = \operatorname{id}, &lt;/math&gt;
and the &lt;math&gt;3 \times 3&lt;/math&gt; Jacobian matrix for flows in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;  given as &lt;math&gt; \ D\varphi \doteq \left(\frac{\partial \varphi_i}{\partial x_j}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

To ensure smooth flows of diffeomorphisms with inverse,  the vector fields &lt;math&gt;  {\mathbb R}^3   &lt;/math&gt; must be at least 1-time continuously differentiable in space&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;P.

&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Diffeomorphism Group}}}}

==The Riemannian orbit model==

Shapes in [[Computational anatomy|Computational Anatomy (CA)]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;are studied via the use of diffeomorphic mapping for establishing correspondences between anatomical coordinate systems. In this setting, 3-dimensional medical images are modelled as diffemorphic transformations of some exemplar, termed the template &lt;math&gt; I_{temp} &lt;/math&gt;, resulting in the observed images to be elements of the random [[Computational anatomy#The deformable template orbit model of CA|orbit model of CA]]. For images these are defined as &lt;math&gt; I \in \mathcal {I}

\doteq \{ I = I_{temp} \circ \varphi, \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V \} &lt;/math&gt;, with for charts representing sub-manifolds denoted as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} \doteq \{ \varphi \cdot M_{temp} : \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V \}&lt;/math&gt;.

===The Riemannian metric===

The orbit of shapes and forms in Computational Anatomy  are generated by the group action &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \doteq \{ \varphi \cdot I : \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V \}&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} \doteq \{ \varphi \cdot M : \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V \}&lt;/math&gt;.   These are made into a Riemannian orbits by introducing a metric associated to each point and associated tangent space. For this a metric is defined on the group which induces the metric on the orbit. Take as the metric for [[Computational anatomy]] at each element of the tangent space &lt;math&gt;\varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V&lt;/math&gt; in the group of diffeomorphisms

:&lt;math&gt; \| \dot \varphi \|_\varphi \doteq \| \dot \varphi \circ \varphi^{-1} \|_V=\| v \|_V, &lt;/math&gt;

with the vector fields modelled to be in a Hilbert space with the norm in the [[Hilbert space]] &lt;math&gt;(V, \| \cdot \|_V )&lt;/math&gt;. We model &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; as a [[Reproducing kernel Hilbert space|reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS)]] defined by a 1-1, differential operator &lt;math&gt; A: V \rightarrow V^*  &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; V^*  &lt;/math&gt; is the dual-space. In general,   &lt;math&gt; \sigma \doteq Av \in V^* &lt;/math&gt; is a generalized function or distribution, the linear form  associated to the inner-product and norm for generalized functions are interpreted by integration by parts according to for &lt;math&gt;v,w \in V&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \langle v , w \rangle_V \doteq \int_X A v \cdot w \, dx, \ \| v\|_V^2 \doteq \int_X A v \cdot v \, dx, \ v,w \in V \ .
&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt; Av \doteq \mu \,dx &lt;/math&gt;, a vector density, &lt;math&gt;\int Av \cdot v \,dx \doteq \int \mu \cdot v \, dx = \sum_{i=1}^3 \mu_i v_i \, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

The differential operator is selected so that the [[Green's function|Green's kernel]] associated to the inverse is sufficiently smooth so that the [[Computational anatomy#The Smoothness Condition on Vector fields as Modelled in a Reproducing kernel Hilbert space|vector fields support 1-continuous derivative]]. The [[Sobolev embedding]] theorem arguments were made in demonstrating that 1-continuous derivative is required for smooth flows. The [[Green's function for the three-variable Laplace equation|Green's]] operator generated from the [[Green's function]](scalar case) associated to the differential operator smooths.

For proper choice of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; (V,\| \cdot \|_V) &lt;/math&gt; is an RKHS with the operator &lt;math&gt; K = A^{-1}: V^* \rightarrow V &lt;/math&gt;.  The Green's kernels associated to the differential operator smooths since for controlling enough derivatives in the square-integral sense the kernel  &lt;math&gt; k(\cdot,\cdot)

&lt;/math&gt; is continuously differentiable in both variables implying

:&lt;math&gt; K Av (x)_i \doteq \sum_j \int_{{\mathbb R}^3}  k_{ij}(x,y) Av_j(y) \,dy \in V \ .
&lt;/math&gt;

== The diffeomorphometry of the space of shapes and forms ==

===The right-invariant metric on diffeomorphisms===

The metric on the group of diffeomorphisms is defined by the distance as defined on pairs of elements in the group of diffeomorphisms according to

For calculating the metric, the geodesics are a dynamical system, the flow of coordinates &lt;math&gt; t \mapsto \phi_t \in \operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt; and the control the vector field &lt;math&gt; t \mapsto v_t \in V&lt;/math&gt; related via &lt;math&gt; \dot \phi_t = v_t \cdot \phi_t,\phi_0=\operatorname{id}. &lt;/math&gt;  The Hamiltonian view

===Landmark or pointset geodesics===

For '''landmarks''', &lt;math&gt; x_i, i=1,\dots,n&lt;/math&gt;, the Hamiltonian momentum

: &lt;math&gt; p(i), i=1,\dots,n&lt;/math&gt;
with Hamiltonian  dynamics taking the form

: &lt;math&gt; H(\phi_t,p_t) =\frac{1}{2}\textstyle \sum_j \sum_i \displaystyle  p_t(i)\cdot K(\phi_t (x_i),\phi_t (x_j)) p_t(j) &lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
v_t =  \textstyle \sum_i \displaystyle  K(\cdot, \phi_t (x_i)) p_t(i)  , \ \\
\dot p_t (i) = - (Dv_t)^T_{|_{\phi_t(x_i)}} p_t(i), i=1,2,\dots, n
\\
\end{cases}  &lt;/math&gt;
The metric between landmarks &lt;math&gt; 
d^2 =\textstyle \sum_i p_0(i)\cdot \sum_j \displaystyle K(x_i,x_j) p_0(j). &lt;/math&gt;

The dynamics associated to these geodesics is shown in the accompanying figure.

The [[vaporizing]] [[droplet]] (droplet vaporization) problem is a challenging issue in [[fluid dynamics]]. It is part of many engineering situations involving the transport and computation of sprays: [[fuel injection]], [[spray painting]], [[aerosol spray]], flashing releases… In most of these engineering situations there is a relative motion between the droplet and the surrounding gas. The gas flow over the droplet has many features of the gas flow over a rigid sphere: [[pressure gradient]], viscous [[boundary layer]], [[wake]]. In addition to these common flow features one can also mention the internal liquid circulation phenomenon driven by surface-[[Shearing (physics)|shear]] forces and the [[boundary layer]] blowing effect.

One of the key parameter which characterizes the gas flow over the droplet is the droplet [[Reynolds number]] based on the relative velocity, droplet diameter and gas phase properties. The features of the gas flow have a critical impact on the exchanges of mass, momentum and energy between the gas and the liquid phases and thus, they have to be properly accounted for in any vaporizing droplet model.

As a first step it is worth investigating the simple case where there is no relative motion between the droplet and the surrounding gas. It will provide some useful insights on the physics involved in the vaporizing droplet problem. In a second step models used in engineering situations where a relative motion between the droplet and the surrounding exists are presented.

==Single spherically symmetric droplet  ==
In this section we assume that there is no relative motion between the droplet and the gas, &lt;math&gt;Re_d=0&lt;/math&gt;, and that the temperature inside the droplet is uniform (models that account for the non-uniformity of the droplet temperature are presented in the next section). The time evolution of the droplet radius, &lt;math&gt;r_d&lt;/math&gt;, and droplet temperature, &lt;math&gt;T_d&lt;/math&gt;, can be computed by solving the following set of ordinary differential equations.::&lt;ref name="Crowe"&gt;Crowe, C., Sommerfeld, M., Tsuji, Y. (1998). ''Multiphase flows with droplets and particles'', CRC Press LLC, {{ISBN|0-8493-9469-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; 4 \pi r^{2}_d \rho_L \frac{\mathrm{d} r_d}{\mathrm{d} t}= - \dot{m}_F.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}_d \rho_L C_{pL} \frac{\mathrm{d} T_d}{\mathrm{d} t}= Q_L.&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;\rho_L&lt;/math&gt; is the liquid density (kg.m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;)
* &lt;math&gt;\dot{m}_F&lt;/math&gt; is the vaporization rate of the droplet (kg.s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)
* &lt;math&gt;C_{pL}&lt;/math&gt; is the liquid specific heat at constant pressure (J.kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)
* &lt;math&gt;Q_L&lt;/math&gt; is the heat flux entering the droplet (J.s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)

The heat flux entering the droplet can be expressed as:&lt;ref name="Crowe"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Q_L = Q_g - \dot{m}_F L_{vap}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;Q_g&lt;/math&gt; is the heat flux from the gas to the droplet surface (J.s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)
* &lt;math&gt;L_{vap}&lt;/math&gt; is the latent heat of evaporation of the specie considered (J.kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)

Analytical expressions for the droplet vaporization rate, &lt;math&gt;\dot{m}_F&lt;/math&gt;, and for the heat flux &lt;math&gt;Q_g&lt;/math&gt; are now derived. A single, pure, component droplet is considered and the gas phase is assumed to behave as an ideal gas. A spherically symmetric field exists for the gas field surrounding the droplet. Analytical expressions for &lt;math&gt;\dot{m}_F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q_g&lt;/math&gt; are found by considering heat and mass transfer processes in the gas film surrounding the droplet.&lt;ref name="Abramzon1988"&gt;Abramzon, B., Sirignano, W. A. (1989). Droplet vaporization model for spray combustion calculations, ''Int. J. Heat Mass Transfer'', Vol. '''32''', No. 9, pp. 1605-1618.&lt;/ref&gt; The droplet vaporizes and creates a radial flow field in the gas film. The vapor from the droplet convects and diffuses away from the droplet surface. Heat conducts radially against the convection toward the droplet interface. This process is called Stefan convection or [[Stefan flow]].&lt;ref name="SirignanoBook"&gt;Sirignano, W. A. (2010).

The gas phase conservation equations for mass, fuel-vapor mass fraction and energy are written in a spherical coordinate system:&lt;ref name="SirignanoBook"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial{r}} \left(\rho_g r^2 u\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial{r}} \left(\rho_g r^2 u Y_F\right) - \frac{\partial}{\partial{r}} \left(\rho_g \mathcal{D} r^2 \frac{\partial{Y_F}}{\partial{r}}\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial{r}} \left(\rho_g r^2 u h_g\right) - \frac{\partial}{\partial{r}} \left(\lambda_g r^2 \frac{\partial{T_g}}{\partial{r}}\right) - \frac{\partial}{\partial{r}} \left(\sum_{i=1}^{N} \rho_g \mathcal{D} h_i r^2  \frac{\partial{Y_i}}{\partial{r}} \right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;\rho_g&lt;/math&gt; density of the gas phase (kg.m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;)
* &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; radial position (m)
* &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; Stefan velocity (m.s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)
* &lt;math&gt;Y_F&lt;/math&gt; Fuel mass fraction in the gas film (-)
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; Mass diffusivity (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)
* &lt;math&gt;h_g&lt;/math&gt; Enthalpy of the gas (J.kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)
* &lt;math&gt;T_g&lt;/math&gt; Gas film temperature (K)
* &lt;math&gt;\lambda_g&lt;/math&gt; Thermal conductivity of the gas (W.m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)
* &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; Number of species inside the gas phase, i.e. air + fuel (-)

It is assumed that the gas phase heat and mass transfer processes are quasi-steady and that the thermo-physical properties might be considered as constant. The assumption of quasi-steadiness of the gas phase finds its limitation in situations in which the gas film surrounding the droplet is in a near-critical state or in a situation in which the gas field is submitted to an acoustic field. The assumption of constant thermo-physical properties is found to be satisfying provided that the properties are evaluated at some reference conditions &lt;ref name="Hubbard"&gt;Hubbard, G. L., Denny, V. E., Mills, A. F. (1975). Droplet vaporization: effects of transients and variable properties, ''Int. J. Heat Mass Transfer'', Vol. '''18''', pp. 1003-1008.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;T_r = T_s + A_r \left( T_{\infty} - T_s \right) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Y_r = Y_{F,s} + A_r \left( Y_{F,\infty} - Y_{F,s} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;T_r&lt;/math&gt; is the reference temperature (K)
* &lt;math&gt;T_s&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature at the droplet surface (K)
* &lt;math&gt;T_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature of the gas far away from the droplet surface (K)
* &lt;math&gt;Y_r&lt;/math&gt; is the reference fuel mass fraction (-)
* &lt;math&gt;Y_{F,s}&lt;/math&gt; is the fuel mass fraction at the droplet surface (-)
* &lt;math&gt;Y_{F,\infty}&lt;/math&gt; is the fuel mass fraction far away from the droplet surface (-)
The ''1/3'' averaging rule, &lt;math&gt;A_r=\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;, is often recommended in the literature&lt;ref name="Hubbard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="YuenChen"&gt;Yuen, M. C., Chen, L. W. (1976). On drag of evaporating liquid droplets, ''Combust. Sci. Technol.'', Vol. '''14''', pp. 147-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservation equation of mass simplifies to:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_g r^2 u = cte = \left( \rho_g r^2 u\right)_s = \frac{\dot{m}_F}{4\pi}&lt;/math&gt;

Combining the conservation equations for mass and fuel vapor mass fraction the following differential equation for the fuel vapor mass fraction &lt;math&gt;Y_F(r)&lt;/math&gt; is obtained:

:&lt;math&gt;4 \pi r^2 \rho_g \mathcal{D} \frac{\mathrm{d}Y_F(r)}{\mathrm{d}r} = \dot{m}_F  \left( Y_F(r)-1\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating this equation between &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and the ambient gas phase region &lt;math&gt;r = \infty&lt;/math&gt; and applying the boundary condition at &lt;math&gt;r=r_d&lt;/math&gt; gives the expression for the droplet vaporization rate:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{m}_F = 4 \pi \rho_g \mathcal{D} r_d \ln \left(1+ B_M \right)&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;B_M=\frac{Y_{F,\infty}-Y_{F,s}}{Y_{F,s}-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;B_M&lt;/math&gt; is the Spalding mass transfer number

Phase equilibrium is assumed at the droplet surface and the mole fraction of fuel vapor at the droplet surface is obtained via the use of the [[Clapeyron's equation]].

An analytical expression for the heat flux &lt;math&gt;Q_g&lt;/math&gt; is now derived. After some manipulations the conservation equation of energy writes:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial{r}} \left( \dot{m}_F h_F - \lambda_g r^2 \frac{\partial{T_g}}{\partial{r}} \right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;h_F&lt;/math&gt; is the enthalpy of the fuel vapor (J.kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)

Applying the boundary condition at the droplet surface and using the relation &lt;math&gt;h=C_p \mathrm{d}T&lt;/math&gt; we have:

:&lt;math&gt;4 \pi \lambda_g r^2 \frac{\mathrm{d}T_g}{\mathrm{d}r} = \dot{m}_F C_{p,F} \left( T_g - T_d + \frac{Q_g}{\dot{m}_F C_{p,F}}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;C_{p,F}&lt;/math&gt; is the specific heat at constant pressure of the fuel vapor (J.Kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)

Integrating this equation from &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; to the ambient gas phase conditions (&lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;) gives the variation of the gas film temperature (&lt;math&gt;T_g&lt;/math&gt;) as a function of the radial distance:

:&lt;math&gt; \ln \left( \frac{T_{\infty}-T_d + \frac{Q_g}{\dot{m}_F C_{p,F}}}{T_g-T_d+\frac{Q_g}{\dot{m}_F C_{p,F}}}\right) = \frac{1}{r}\frac{\dot{m}_F C_{p,F}}{4 \pi \lambda_g}&lt;/math&gt;

The above equation provides a second expression for the droplet vaporization rate:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{m}_F=4 \pi r_d \frac{\lambda_g}{C_{p,F}} \ln \left( 1 + B_T\right)&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;B_T=\frac{\dot{m}_F C_{p,F}}{Q_g} \left( T_{\infty} - T_d\right) &lt;/math&gt;

where:
*&lt;math&gt;B_T&lt;/math&gt; is the Spalding heat transfer number

Finally combining the new expression for the droplet vaporization rate and the expression for the variation of the gas film temperature the following equation is obtained for &lt;math&gt;Q_g&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;Q_g = 4 \pi r_d \lambda_g \frac{\ln \left( 1 + B_T\right)}{B_T} \left( T_{\infty} - T_d\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Two different expressions for the droplet vaporization rate &lt;math&gt;\dot{m}_F&lt;/math&gt; have been derived. Hence, a relation exists between the Spalding mass transfer number and the Spalding heat transfer number and writes:

:&lt;math&gt;B_T=\left( 1+B_M\right)^{\frac{1}{Le}\frac{C_{p,F}}{C_{p,g}}}-1&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;Le&lt;/math&gt; is the gas film [[Lewis number]] (-)
* &lt;math&gt;C_{p,g}&lt;/math&gt; is the gas film specific heat at constant pressure (J.Kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)

The droplet vaporization rate can be expressed as a function of the Sherwood number. The Sherwood number describes the non-dimensional mass transfer rate to the droplet and is defined as:&lt;ref name="SirignanoBook"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Sh = \frac{-2 r_d}{Y_s-Y_{\infty}} \left(\frac{\partial{Y_F}}{\partial{r}}\right)_s = 2 \frac{\ln \left( 1+B_M\right)}{B_M}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the expression for the droplet vaporization rate can be re-written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{m}_F=2 \pi r_d \mathcal{D} \rho_g B_M Sh &lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the conductive heat transfer from the gas to the droplet can be expressed as a function of the Nusselt number. The Nusselt number describes a non-dimensional heat transfer rate to the droplet and is defined as:&lt;ref name="SirignanoBook"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Nu=\frac{2 r_d}{T_{\infty}-T_d}\left(\frac{\partial{T_g}}{\partial{r}}\right)_s = 2 \frac{\ln \left( 1+B_T\right)}{B_T}&lt;/math&gt;

and then:

:&lt;math&gt;Q_g=2 \pi r_d \lambda_g Nu \left(T_{\infty}-T_d\right)&lt;/math&gt;

In the limit where &lt;math&gt;B_T \to 0&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;Nu \to 2&lt;/math&gt; which corresponds to the classical heated sphere result.&lt;ref name="SirignanoBook"/&gt;

== Single convective droplet  ==

The relative motion between a droplet and the gas results in an increase of the heat and mass transfer rates in the gas film surrounding the droplet. A convective boundary layer and a wake can surround the droplet. Furthermore, the shear force on the liquid surface causes an internal circulation that enhances the heating of the liquid. As a consequence, the vaporization rate increases with the droplet Reynolds number. Many different models exist for the single convective droplet vaporization case. Vaporizing droplet models can be seen to belong to six different classes:&lt;ref name="SirignanoBook"/&gt;

# Constant droplet temperature model (d2-law)
# Infinite liquid conductivity model
# Spherically symmetric transient droplet heating model
# Effective conductivity model
# Vortex model of droplet heating
# Navier-Stokes solution

The main difference between all these models is the treatment of the heating of the liquid phase which is usually the rate controlling phenomenon in droplet vaporization.&lt;ref name="SirignanoBook"/&gt; The first three models do not consider internal liquid circulation. The effective conductivity model (4) and the vortex model of droplet heating (5) account for internal circulation and internal convective heating. The direct resolution of the Navier-Stokes equations provide, in principle, exact solutions both for the gas phase and the liquid phase.

Model (1) is a simplification of model (2) which is in turn a simplification of model (3). The spherically symmetric transient droplet heating model (3) solves the equation for heat diffusion through the liquid phase. A droplet heating time τ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; can be defined as the time required for a thermal diffusion wave to penetrate from the droplet surface to its center. The droplet heating time is compared to the droplet lifetime, τ&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;. If the droplet heating time is short compared to the droplet lifetime we can assume that the temperature field inside the droplet is uniform and model (2) is obtained. In the infinite liquid conductivity model (2) the temperature of the droplet is uniform but varies with time. It is possible to go one step further and find the conditions for which we can neglect the temporal variation of the droplet temperature. The liquid temperature varies in time until the [[wet-bulb temperature]] is reached. If the [[wet-bulb temperature]] is reached in a time of the same order of magnitude than the droplet heating time then the liquid temperature can be considered to be constant with regards to time. Model (1), the d2-law, is obtained.

The infinite liquid conductivity model is widely used in industrial spray calculations:&lt;ref name="Aggarwal2"&gt;Aggarwal, S. K., Peng, F. (1995). A review of droplet dynamics and vaporization modeling for engineering calculations, ''Journal of Engineering for gas turbines and power'', Vol. '''117''', p. 453.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aggarwal1"&gt;Aggarwal, S. K., Tong, A. Y., Sirignano, W. A. (1984). A comparison of vaporization models in spray calculations, ''AIAA Journal'', Vol. '''22''',No 10, p. 1448.&lt;/ref&gt; for its balance between computational costs and accuracy. To account for the convective effects which enhanced the heat and mass transfer rates around the droplet, a correction is applied to the spherically symmetric expressions of the Sherwood and Nusselt numbers &lt;ref name="Abramzon1988"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{m}_F = 4 \pi \rho_g \mathcal{D} r_d Sh^* \ln \left(1+ B_M \right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Q_g = 2 \pi r_d \lambda_g Nu^* \frac{\ln \left( 1 + B_T\right)}{B_T} \left( T_{\infty} - T_d\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Abramzon and Sirignano &lt;ref name="Abramzon1988"/&gt; suggest the following formulation for the modified Sherwood and Nusselt numbers:

:&lt;math&gt;Sh^*=2+ \frac{\left(Sh_0-2\right)}{F_M}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Nu^*=2+ \frac{\left(Nu_0-2\right)}{F_T}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

* &lt;math&gt;F_M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_T&lt;/math&gt; account for surface blowing which results in a thickening of the boundary layer surrounding the droplet.

and the well known Frossling correlations (or Ranz-Marshall correlations &lt;ref name="Crowe"/&gt;) can be used to express ''Nu&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''Sh&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt;Sh_0=2 + 0.552 Re^{\frac{1}{2}} Sc^{\frac{1}{3}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Nu_0=2 + 0.552 Re^{\frac{1}{2}} Pr^{\frac{1}{3}}&lt;/math&gt;

where

* &lt;math&gt;Sc&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Schmidt number]]
* &lt;math&gt;Pr&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Prandtl number]]

The expressions above show that the heat and mass transfer rates increase with increasing Reynolds number.

Other critical aspects for controlling the microenvironment include: cell seeding density, reduction of air bubbles as they can rupture cell membranes, evaporation of media due to an insufficiently humid environment, and cell culture maintenance (i.e. regular, timely media changes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meyvantsson I, Beebe DJ | title = Cell culture models in microfluidic systems | journal = Annual Review of Analytical Chemistry | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 423–49 | date = 2008-06-13 | pmid = 20636085 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.anchem.1.031207.113042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu H, Alexander CM, Beebe DJ | title = Understanding microchannel culture: parameters involved in soluble factor signaling | journal = Lab on a Chip | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = 726–30 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17538714 | doi = 10.1039/b618793e  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==

Some of the major advantages of microfluidic cell culture include reduced sample volumes (especially important when using primary cells, which are often limited) and the flexibility to customize and study multiple microenvironments within the same device.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mehling M, Tay S | title = Microfluidic cell culture | journal = Current Opinion in Biotechnology | volume = 25 | pages = 95–102 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24484886 | doi = 10.1016/j.copbio.2013.10.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A reduced cell population can also be used in a microscale system (e.g., a few hundred cells) in comparison to macroscale culture systems (which often require 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; – 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; cells); this can make studying certain cell-cell interactions more accessible.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Halldorsson S, Lucumi E, Gómez-Sjöberg R, Fleming RM | title = Advantages and challenges of microfluidic cell culture in polydimethylsiloxane devices | journal = Biosensors &amp; Bioelectronics | volume = 63 | pages = 218–231 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25105943 | doi = 10.1016/j.bios.2014.07.029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These reduced cell numbers make studying non-dividing or slow dividing cells (e.g., [[stem cell]]s) easier than traditional culture methods (e.g., flasks, petri dishes, or well plates) due to the smaller sample volumes.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gómez-Sjöberg R, Leyrat AA, Pirone DM, Chen CS, Quake SR | title = Versatile, fully automated, microfluidic cell culture system | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 79 | issue = 22 | pages = 8557–63 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17953452 | doi = 10.1021/ac071311w }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the small dimensions in microfluidics, [[laminar flow]] can be achieved, allowing manipulations with the culture system to be done easily without affecting other culture chambers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Laminar flow is also useful as is it mimics ''in vivo'' fluid dynamics more accurately, often making microscale culture more relevant than traditional culture methods.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cimetta E, Vunjak-Novakovic G | title = Microscale technologies for regulating human stem cell differentiation | journal = Experimental Biology and Medicine | volume = 239 | issue = 9 | pages = 1255–63 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 24737735 | pmc = 4476254 | doi = 10.1177/1535370214530369 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture Platforms ==

=== Two-dimensional culture ===

Two-dimensional (2D) cell culture is cell culture that takes place on a flat surface, e.g. the bottom of a well-plate, and is known as the conventional method.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhatia SN, Ingber DE | title = Microfluidic organs-on-chips | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 32 | issue = 8 | pages = 760–72 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 25093883 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2989 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While these platforms are useful for growing and passaging cells to be used in subsequent experiments, they are not ideal environments to monitor cell responses to stimuli as cells cannot freely move or perform functions as observed ''in vivo'' that are dependent on cell-extracellular matrix material interactions.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Three-dimensional culture ===

[[3D cell culture|Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture]] is cell culture that takes place in a biologically relevant matrix, usually this involves cells being embedded in a [[hydrogel]] containing extracellular molecules (e.g., [[collagen]]).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; By adding an additional dimension, more advanced cell architectures can be achieved, and cell behavior is more representative of ''in vivo'' dynamics; cells can engage in enhanced communication with neighboring cells and cell-extracellular matrix interactions can be modeled.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pampaloni F, Reynaud EG, Stelzer EH | title = The third dimension bridges the gap between cell culture and live tissue | journal = Nature Reviews.

Some of the challenges include: imaging of the cells, control of gradients in static models (i.e., without a perfusion system), and difficulty recreating [[vasculature]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Despite these challenges, 3D models are still used as tools for studying and testing drug responses in [[Pharmacology|pharmacological]] studies.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In recent years, there are microfluidic devices reproducing the complex ''in vivo'' microvascular network.

==General concepts of physics ==

===Basic principles of physics===
Physics &amp;ndash; branch of science that studies [[matter]]&lt;!--
   --&gt;&lt;ref name="feynmanleightonsands1963-atomic"&gt;At the start of ''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]'', [[Richard Feynman]] offers the [[Atomic theory|atomic hypothesis]] as the single most prolific scientific concept: "If, in some cataclysm, all [] scientific knowledge were to be destroyed [save] one sentence&amp;nbsp;[...] what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is&amp;nbsp;[...] that ''all things are made up of atoms&amp;nbsp;– little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another''&amp;nbsp;..." {{harv|Feynman|Leighton|Sands|1963|p=I-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--
           --&gt;and its [[Motion (physics)|motion]] through [[Spacetime|space and time]], along with related concepts such as [[energy]] and [[force]].&lt;!--
   --&gt;&lt;ref name="maxwell1878-physicalscience"&gt;"Physical science is that department of knowledge which relates to the order of nature, or, in other words, to the regular succession of events." {{harv|Maxwell|1878|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--
           --&gt;  Physics is one of the "[[fundamental science]]s" because the other natural sciences (like biology, geology  etc.) deal with systems that seem to obey the laws of physics. According to physics, the physical laws of matter, energy and the fundamental forces of nature govern the interactions between particles and physical entities (such as planets, molecules, atoms or the subatomic particles). Some of the basic pursuits of physics, which include some of the most prominent developments in modern science in the last millennium, include:

'''Nonlinear frictiophoresis''' is the unidirectional drift of a particle in a medium caused by periodic driving force with zero mean. The effect is possible due to nonlinear dependence of the friction-drag force on the particle's velocity. It was discovered theoretically.,&lt;ref name="AlexanderVidybida1985"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
At first glance, a periodic driving force with zero mean is able to entrain a particle into an oscillating movement without unidirectional drift, because integral momentum provided to the particle by the force is zero. The possibility of unidirectional drift can be recognized if one takes into account that the particle itself loses momentum through transferring it further to the medium it moves in/at. If the friction is nonlinear, then it may so happen that the momentum loss during movement in one direction does not equal to that in the opposite direction and this causes unidirectional drift. For this to happen, the driving force time-dependence must be more complicated than it is in a single sinusoidal harmonic.

==A simple example - Bingham plastic==
===Nonlinear friction===

The simplest case of friction-velocity dependence law is the
[[Stokes's law|Stokes's]] one:
: &lt;math&gt;(1) \qquad F_{dr}(v)=\lambda v,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; F_{dr}(v) &lt;/math&gt; is the friction/drag force applied to a particle moving with velocity &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; in a medium. The friction-velocity law (1) is observed for a slowly moving spherical particle in a [[Newtonian fluid]].[[File:Linear friction-1.svg|thumb|300px|Fig. 1 Linear friction]] It is linear, see Fig. 1, and is not suitable for nonlinear frictiophoresis to take place. The characteristic property of the law (1) is that any, even a very small driving force is able to get particle moving. This is not the case for such media as [[Bingham plastic]]. For those media, it is necessary to apply some threshold force, &lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt;, to get the particle moving. This kind of friction-velocity (dry friction) law has a jump discontinuity at &lt;math&gt;v=0&lt;/math&gt;:
:  &lt;math&gt;(2) \qquad F_{dr}(v)=\lambda v + d\cdot \mathrm{sign}(v).&lt;/math&gt;
[[File:Dry friction-1.svg|thumb|300px|Fig. 2 Nonlinear friction example]]
It is nonlinear, see Fig. 2, and is used in this example.

===Periodic driving force===
Let &lt;math&gt;T&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; denote the period of driving force. Chose a time
value &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt;
such that &lt;math&gt;0&lt;t_1&lt;T&lt;/math&gt;
and two force values, &lt;math&gt;F^+&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;F^-&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;
such that the following relations are
satisfied:
:&lt;math&gt;
 \qquad  \qquad  F^+&gt;d,\quad |F^-|&lt;d,
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
 (3) \qquad  F^+ t_1 + F^-(T-t_1)=0.
&lt;/math&gt;
The periodic driving force &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt;
used in this example is as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
 (4) \qquad  f(t)=\begin{cases}
F^+, \text{ if }0&lt;t\le t_1,
\\
F^-,  \text{ if } t_1&lt;t\le T,\quad f(t+T)=f(t).
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
It is clear that, due to (3), &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; has zero mean:
:&lt;math&gt;
 \int\limits_0^T f(t)dt=F^+ t_1 + F^-(T-t_1)=0.
&lt;/math&gt;
[[File:Driving force example-1.svg|thumb|300px|Fig. 3 Zero mean driving force example]]
See also Fig. 3.

===Unidirectional drift===

For the sake of simplicity, we consider here the physical situation when inertia may be neglected. The latter can be achieved if
particle's mass is small, velocity is low and friction is high. This conditions have to ensure that &lt;math&gt;\tau\ll t_1&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the relaxation time. In this situation, the particle driven with force (4) immediately starts moving with constant velocity 
&lt;math&gt;v^+=\frac{1}{\lambda}(F^+-d)&lt;/math&gt; during interval
&lt;math&gt;0&lt;t\le t_1&lt;/math&gt;
and will immediately
stop moving during interval &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;t\le T&lt;/math&gt;, see Fig. 4.
[[File:Velocity example-1.svg|thumb|300px|Fig. 4 Velocity with nonzero mean]]
This results in the
positive mean velocity of unidirectional drift:
:&lt;math&gt;
 \qquad  \qquad 
\overline{v(t)}=\frac{1}{T}\int\limits_0^T v(t)dt =
\frac{t_1}{\lambda T}(F^+-d)&gt;0.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Mathematical analysis==

Analysis of possibility to get a nonzero drift by periodic force with
zero integral has been made in
.&lt;ref name="AlexanderVidybida1985"/&gt;
The dimensionless
equation of motion for a particle driven by periodic force
&lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(t+1)=f(t)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\int_0^1f(t)dt=0&lt;/math&gt;
is as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
(5)\qquad  \dot{v}+\lambda v -\epsilon g(v) = f(t),
&lt;/math&gt;
where the friction/drag force
&lt;math&gt;F_{dr}(v)=\lambda v -\epsilon g(v)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies
the following:
:&lt;math&gt;
\qquad\qquad F_{dr}(-v)=-F_{dr}(v),\quad \frac{d}{dv}F_{dr}(v)\ge 0.
&lt;/math&gt;
It is proven in &lt;ref name="AlexanderVidybida1985"/&gt;
that any solution to (5)
settles down onto periodic regime
&lt;math&gt;v^*(t)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v^*(t+1)=v^*(t)&lt;/math&gt;, which has nonzero mean:
:&lt;math&gt;
\qquad\qquad \overline{v^*(t)}=\int\limits_0^1v^*(t)dt\ne 0,
&lt;/math&gt;
almost certainly, provided &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt;
is not antiperiodic.&lt;ref&gt;Function  &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; is antiperiodic   if for some &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; the following relation  &lt;math&gt;f(t+A)=-f(t)&lt;/math&gt; holds for all &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Individual harmonics, like &lt;math&gt;\sin(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;, are antiperiodic.&lt;/ref&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;g(v)=v^3&lt;/math&gt;, two cases of &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; have been considered explicitly:

1. Saw-shaped driving force, see Fig. 5:
[[File:Saw force-1.svg|thumb|300px|Fig. 5 Saw-shaped driving force]]
:&lt;math&gt;
\qquad\qquad f(t)=at,\quad t\in[-1/2;1/2],\quad f(t+1)=f(t),\quad t\in ]-\infty;\infty[.
&lt;/math&gt;
In this case, found in &lt;ref name="AlexanderVidybida1985"/&gt;
first order in  &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; approximation to &lt;math&gt;v^*(t)&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;v_1^*(t)&lt;/math&gt;, has the following mean value:
:&lt;math&gt;
\qquad\qquad     \Big|\overline{v^*_1(t)}\Big|
 \equiv\Big|\int\limits_0^1v_1^*(t)dt\Big|\ge\frac{2}{3}\epsilon a^3/\lambda^5.
&lt;/math&gt;
This estimate is made expecting &lt;math&gt;\lambda\gg 1&lt;/math&gt;.

2. Two harmonics driving force,
:&lt;math&gt;
\qquad\qquad f(t)=a\cos(2\pi t) + b\cos(4\pi t+\psi).
&lt;/math&gt;
In this case, the first order in &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; approximation
has the following mean value:
:&lt;math&gt;
\qquad\qquad \Big|\overline{v^*_1(t)}\Big|=\Big|\int\limits_0^1v_1^*(t)dt\Big|
\ge\frac{2}{27}\frac{\epsilon}{\lambda}\left(\frac{M}{\lambda}\right)^3
\frac{1}
     {(1+\frac{4\pi^2}{\lambda^2})(1+\frac{16\pi^2}{\lambda^2})^{1/2}}.
&lt;/math&gt;
This value is maximized in &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a,b&lt;/math&gt;, keeping &lt;math&gt;a+b=M&lt;/math&gt; constant. Interesting that the drift value depends on &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; and changes its direction twice as &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; spans over the interval &lt;math&gt;[0;2\pi]&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;/ref&gt; based on symmetry breaking suggests as well that a zero mean driving force is able to generate a directed drift.

==Applications==
[[File:Fdrag.png|thumb|300px|Fig.6 (a): solid line -- the drag force per charge on single b.p. vs velocity, dotted line -- linear approximation for comparison. (b): same as (a), but in fine scale]] In applications, the nature of force &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; in (5), is usually electric, similar to forces acting during standard [[electrophoresis]]. The only differences are that the force is periodic and without constant component.
For the effect to show up, the dependence of friction/drag force on velocity must be nonlinear. This is the case for numerous substances known as [[non-Newtonian fluid]]s. Among these are [[gel]]s, and [[Dilatant|dilatant fluids]], [[Shear thinning|pseudoplastic fluids]], [[liquid crystal]]s.

Dedicated experiments&lt;ref name="AlexanderVidybida2000"/&gt;
have determined &lt;math&gt;F_{dr}(v)&lt;/math&gt; for a standard DNA ladder up to 1500 bp long in 1.5% agarose gel. The dependence found, see Fig. 6, supports the possibility of nonlinear frictiophoresis in such a system. Based on data in  Fig. 6, an optimal time course for driving electric field with zero mean, &lt;math&gt;E(t)&lt;/math&gt;, has been found in,&lt;ref name="AlexanderVidybida2000"/&gt; which ensures maximal drift for 1500 b.p. long fragment,
see Fig. 7.
[[File:Velocity.png|thumb|300px| Fig. 7 Time courses of optimal electric field, &lt;math&gt;E(t)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E(t\pm 1s)=E(t)&lt;/math&gt;, steady-state velocity, &lt;math&gt;v^*(t)&lt;/math&gt;, and displacement, &lt;math&gt;X(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The drift value &lt;math&gt;\overline{v^*(t)}=0.31 \mu&lt;/math&gt;m/s.]]

The effect of unidirectional drift caused by periodic force with zero integral value has a peculiar dependence on the time course of the force applied.  See the previous section for examples. This offers a new dimension to a set of separation problems.

===DNA separation with respect to length===
In the DNA fragments separation,
zero mean periodic electric field is used in zero-integrated-field electrophoresis (ZIFE),&lt;ref name="Noolandi1995"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
where the field time dependence similar to that shown in Fig. 3 is used.
This allows to separate long fragments in agarose gel,
nonseparable by standard constant field electrophoresis.
The long DNA geometry and its manner of movement in a gel,
known as [[reptation]]
do not allow to apply directly the consideration based on Eq. (5), above.

===Separation with respect to specific mass===
It was observed,
&lt;ref name="VidybidaUnp"&gt;
{{cite journal
|last1=Vidybida|first1=A.
|title=Unpublished observation
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
that under certain physical conditions
the mechanism described in Mathematical analysis section, above,
can be used for separation with respect to specific mass,
like particles made of isotopes of the same material.

==Extensions==
The idea of organizing directed drift with zero mean periodic drive
have obtained further development for other configurations
and other physical mechanism of nonlinearity.

===Rotation by means of circular wave===
An [[Dipole|electric dipole]]
rotating freely around &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis
in a medium with nonlinear friction can be manipulated by
applying electromagnetic wave polarized circularly along &lt;math&gt;\pm z&lt;/math&gt;
and composed of two harmonics. The equation of motion
for this system is as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
\qquad \qquad \dot{\omega}+\lambda \omega -\epsilon g(\omega) = f(t,\theta(t)),\quad \dot{\theta}=\omega,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;f(t,\theta(t))&lt;/math&gt; is the torque acting on the dipole due to
circular wave: 
:&lt;math&gt;
 (6)\qquad f(t,\theta(t))\sim
  |p|(A_1\cos(\omega t\pm\theta)+A_2\cos(2\omega t\pm\theta+\psi)),
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the dipole moment component orthogonal
to &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis
and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; defines the dipole direction in the &lt;math&gt;XY&lt;/math&gt; plane. By choosing proper
phase shift &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; in (6) it is possible to
orient the dipole in any desired direction, &lt;math&gt;\theta_0&lt;/math&gt;.
The direction &lt;math&gt;\theta_0&lt;/math&gt; is
attained due to angular directed drift, which becomes zero when
&lt;math&gt;\theta=\theta_0&lt;/math&gt;.

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
A small detuning between the first and second harmonic in (6) results in continuous rotational drift.&lt;ref name="DT" /&gt;

===Modification of potential function===
[[File:Ini modi-1.png|thumb|300px|Fig. 8 Example of modification of potential function &lt;math&gt;U(x)&lt;/math&gt; due to nonlinear frictiophoresis. (a) initial &lt;math&gt;U(x)&lt;/math&gt;, (b) modified &lt;math&gt;U(x)&lt;/math&gt;.]]
If a particle undergoes a directed drift while moving freely in accordance
with Eq. (5), then it drifts similarly if a shallow enough
potential field &lt;math&gt;U(x)&lt;/math&gt; is imposed. Equation of motion in that case is:
:&lt;math&gt;
\qquad\qquad \dot{v}+\lambda v -\epsilon g(v) = f(t) - \phi(x),\quad \dot{x}=v,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the force due to potential field. The drift continues until a steep enough region in the course of &lt;math&gt;U(x)&lt;/math&gt; is met, which is able to stop the drift. This kind of behavior, as rigorous mathematical analysis shows,

&lt;/ref&gt;
results in modification of &lt;math&gt;U(x)&lt;/math&gt; by adding a linear in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; term. This may  change the &lt;math&gt;U(x)&lt;/math&gt; qualitatively, by, e.g. changing the number of equilibrium points, see Fig. 8. The effect may be essential during high frequency
electric field acting on biopolymers.

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Another nonlinearity===
For [[electrophoresis]] of colloid particles under a small strength electric field, the force &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt;
in the right-hand side of Eq. (5) is linearly proportional to the
strength &lt;math&gt;E(t)&lt;/math&gt; of the electric field applied. For a high strength,
the linearity is broken due to nonlinear polarization.
As a result, the force may depend nonlinearly on the applied field:
:&lt;math&gt;
\qquad\qquad f(t)\sim E(t)+\alpha (E(t))^3.
&lt;/math&gt;
In the last expression, even if
the applied field, &lt;math&gt;E(t)&lt;/math&gt; has zero mean, the applied force &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; may happen to have a constant component that can cause a directed drift.

&lt;/ref&gt;
As above, for this to happen, &lt;math&gt;E(t)&lt;/math&gt; must have more than a single sinusoidal harmonic.
This same effect for a liquid in a tube may serve in
[[electroosmotic pump]]
driven with zero mean electric field.&lt;ref name="DukhinPat"&gt;

'''Landolt–Börnstein''' is the largest collection of critically evaluated property data in [[materials science]] and the closely related fields of [[chemistry]], [[physics]] and [[engineering]] published by [[SpringerNature|Springer Nature]].
[[File:LB-image.gif|thumb]]

==History==
On July 28, 1882, Dr. [[Hans Heinrich Landolt]] and Dr. [[Richard Börnstein]], both professors at the "[[Agricultural University of Berlin|Landwirtschaftliche Hochschule]]" (Agricultural College) at Berlin, signed a contract with the publisher Ferdinand Springer on the publication of a collection of tables with physical-chemical data. The title of this book "Physikalisch-chemische Tabellen" (Physical-Chemical Tables) published in 1883 was soon forgotten. Owing to its success the data collection has been known for more than a hundred years by each scientist only as "The Landolt-Börnstein".

1250 copies of the 1st Edition were printed and sold. In 1894, the 2nd Edition was published, in 1905 the 3rd Edition, in 1912 the 4th Edition, and finally in 1923 the 5th Edition. Supplementary volumes of the latter were printed until as late as 1936. New Editions saw changes in large expansion of volumes, number of authors, updated structure, additional tables and coverage of new areas of physics and chemistry.

The 5th Edition was eventually published in 1923, consisting of two volumes and comprising a total of 1,695 pages. Sixty three authors had contributed to it. The growth that had already been noticed in previous editions, continued. It was clear, that "another edition in approximately 10 years" was no solution. A complete conceptual change of the Landolt-Börnstein had thus become necessary. For the meantime supplementary volumes in two-year intervals should be provided to fill in the blanks and add the latest data. The first supplementary volume of the 5th Edition was published in 1927, the second in 1931 and the third in 1935/36. The latter consisted of three sub-volumes with a total of 3,039 pages and contributions from 82 authors.

The 6th Edition (1950) was published in line with the revised general frame. The basic idea was to have four volumes instead of one, each of which was to cover different fields of the Landolt-Börnstein under different editors. Each volume was given a detailed table of contents. Two major restrictions were also imposed. The author of a contribution was asked to choose a "Bestwert" (optimum value) from the mass of statements of an experimental value in the publications of different authors, or derive a "wahrscheinlichster Wert” (most possible value). The other change of importance was that not only diagrams became as important as tables, but that text also became necessary to explain the presented data.

== The New Series ==
The new concept of the 6th Edition – splitting of the edition in four volumes with a yet unknown number of sub-volumes – was a slight progress, but eventually, it has not proven to be of much use. Instead of publishing new editions of the data collection one after the other, the "New Series" concept was intended to publish independent volumes that were each to cover a certain closed theme. It was flexible enough to follow the changes in the scientific interest and abandon the previous structuring of physics and chemistry in favor of new themes. Thus, new subjects such as solid-state physics could easily be comprised in groups of volumes. This concept has been adhered to up to now.

The New Series represents over 520 books published between 1961 and 2018 and includes more than 220,000 pages covering [[Mechanical properties|mechanical]], [[Optical properties|optical]], [[Acoustics|acoustical]], [[thermal]], [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic]], [[Electricity|electrical]] and [[Magnetism|magnetic]] properties among others. The New Series offers critically evaluated data by over 1,000 expert authors and editors in materials science. 

== Landolt-Börnstein Online ==
Landolt–Börnstein books have gone through various digitization initiatives, from CD-ROM to FTP and PDF formats. Landolt–Börnstein books content is now available on SpringerMaterials, a comprehensive database for identifying material properties which covers data from materials science, physics, physical and inorganic chemistry, engineering and other related fields. SpringerMaterials offers advanced materials science-specific search functionality that allows easy retrieval of accurate results. Recently introduced [https://materials.springer.com/about-springer-materials-interactive SpringerMaterials Interactive] is a set of advanced functionalities for visualizing and analyzing materials property data. Examples of these functionalities include interactive graphs, dynamic data tables, and side-by- side comparisons of materials/properties.

While WIMPs would be [[elementary particles]] described by the [[Standard Model|standard model]] that can in principle be studied by experimentalists in laboratories such as [[CERN]], the proposed particles called GIMPs would follow the [[Vacuum solution (general relativity)|Vacuum Solutions]] of Einstein's equation. They are just singular structures of [[spacetime]] in a geometry whose average forms the [[dark energy]] that Einstein expressed in his [[cosmological constant]]. The identification of "dark matter" with GIMPs proposed&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/934197277|title=Particles and Quantum Fields|last=Kleinert|first=Hagen|publisher=World Scientific|year=2017|isbn=978-9814740890|location=Singapore|pages=1545–1553|oclc=934197277|author-link=Hagen Kleinert}}
&lt;/ref&gt; makes dark matter a form of dark energy filled with singularities, i.e., an entangled dark energy. This would roughly confirm Einstein's hope in 1919&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; that all particles in the universe would follow the traceless version of his equation. If we identify all matter as the sum of dark energy plus dark matter in the form of GIMPs, his expectation would turn out to have been ''almost'' right. Matter would play a similar role as the point charges in the [[Maxwell's equations|homogeneous Maxwell equation]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\nabla^2 E = 0&lt;/math&gt; in which delta functions are ignored. The sum of dark matter plus dark energy makes up 76% of all matter, which is sufficient to allow computer simulations to produce a good impression of the behavior of all matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnMlSbELUh4|title=Hydrodynamical Simulations of Galaxy Formation: Progress, pitfalls, and promises|last=Springel|first=Volker|authorlink=Volker Springel|date=2016-09-27|website=YouTube|series=Joint IAS/PU Astrophysics Colloquium|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Statistical mechanics}}
'''Stochastic thermodynamics''' is an emergent field of research in [[statistical mechanics]] that uses [[stochastic process|stochastic variables]] to better understand the [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics|non-equilibrium dynamics]] present in microscopic systems such as [[Colloid|colloidal particles]], [[biopolymer]]s (e.g. [[DNA]], [[RNA]], and [[protein]]s), [[enzymes]], [[molecular motors]] and many other types of systems.{{efn|See {{harvp|Seifert|2008}},{{sfnm|1a1=Campisi et al.|1y=2011|1p=3|2a1=Jarzynski|2y=2011|2p=347}} {{harvp|Seifert|2012}}{{sfnm|1a1=Bertini et al.|1y=2015|1p=4|2a1=Bechinger et al.|2y=2016|2p=45}} and {{harvp|Jarzynski|2011}}{{sfnm|1a1=Campisi et al.|1y=2011|1p=3|2a1=Seifert|2y=2012|2p=10|3a1=Bechinger et al.|3y=2016|3p=45}} for academic review articles of stochastic thermodynamics.}}{{sfn|Seifert|2012|p=7}}

==Overview==
When a microscopic machine (e.g. a [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEM]]) performs [[useful work]] it generates [[heat]] and [[entropy]] as a byproduct of the process, however it is also predicted that this machine will operate in "reverse" or "backwards" over appreciable short periods. That is, heat energy from the surroundings will be converted into useful work. For larger engines, this would be described as a violation of the [[second law of thermodynamics]], as entropy is consumed rather than generated. [[Loschmidt's paradox]]{{sfn|Loschmidt|1876}} states that in a time reversible system, for every trajectory there exists a time-reversed anti-trajectory. As the entropy production of a trajectory and its equal anti-trajectory are of identical magnitude but opposite sign, then, so the argument goes, one cannot prove that entropy production is positive.{{sfn|Wang et al.|2002|p=050601-1}}

For a long time, exact results in thermodynamics were only possible in linear systems capable of reaching equilibrium, leaving other questions like the Loschmidt paradox unsolved. During the last few decades fresh approaches have revealed general laws applicable to non-equilibrium system which are described by nonlinear equations, pushing the range of exact thermodynamic statements beyond the realm of traditional linear solutions. These exact results are particularly relevant for small systems where appreciable (typically non-Gaussian) fluctuations occur. Thanks to stochastic thermodynamics it is now possible to accurately predict distribution functions of thermodynamic quantities relating to exchanged heat, applied work or entropy production for these systems.{{sfn|Seifert|2012|p=6}}

===Fluctuation theorem===
{{main|Fluctuation theorem}}
The mathematical resolution to Loschmidt's paradox is called the (steady state) fluctuation theorem (FT), which is a generalisation of the second law of thermodynamics. The FT shows that as a system gets larger or the trajectory duration becomes longer, entropy-consuming trajectories become more unlikely, and the expected second law behaviour is recovered. The FT was first put forward by {{harvp|Evans et al.|1993}}{{sfnm|1a1=Gerstner|1y=2002|2a1=Wang et al.|2y=2002|2p=1|3a1=Seifert|3y=2008|3p=1|4a1=Seifert|4y=2012|4p=6|5a1=Jarzynski|5y=2011|5p=331|6a1=Campisi et al.|6y=2011|6p=3}} and much of the work done in developing and extending the theorem was accomplished by theoreticians and mathematicians interested in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics.{{efn|Evan's original numerical analysis was shown heuristically and related to a thermostatted shear-driven fluid in contact with a heat bath. It was later mathematically proven for a large class of systems using concepts from [[Chaos theory|chaotic dynamics]] by {{harvp|Gallavotti|Cohen|1995}}, for driven [[Langevin dynamics]] by {{harvp|Kurchan|1998}} and for driven [[Diffusion|diffusive dynamic]]s by {{harvp|Lebowitz|Spohn|1999}}. A variant, a transient fluctuation theorem valid for relaxation towards the steady state was later found by {{harvp|Evans|Searles|1994}}.{{sfn|Seifert|2012|p=6}} }}{{sfn|Wang et al.|2002|p=050601-1}}

The first observation and experimental proof of Evan's fluctuation theorem (FT) was performed by {{harvp|Wang et al.|2002}}{{sfnm|2a1=Gerstner|2y=2002|1a1=Chalmers|1y=2002|3a1=Whitehouse|3y=2002}}

===Jarzynski equality===
{{main|Jarzynski equality}}
A recent review states that {{harvs|txt|last1=Jarzynski|year1=1997a|year2=1997b}} "proved a remarkable relation which allows to express the free energy difference between two equilibrium systems by a nonlinear average over the work required to drive the system in a non-equilibrium process from one state to the other. By comparing probability distributions for the work spent in the original process with the time-reversed one, Crooks found a “refinement” of the Jarzynski relation (JR), now called the Crooks fluctuation theorem. Both, this relation and another refinement of the JR, the Hummer-Szabo relation became particularly useful for determining free energy differences and landscapes of biomolecules. These relations are the most prominent ones within a class of exact results (some of which found even earlier and then rediscovered) valid for non-equilibrium systems driven by time-dependent forces. A close analogy to the JR, which relates different equilibrium states, is the Hatano-Sasa relation that applies to transitions between two different non-equilibrium steady states". {{sfn|Seifert|2012|p=2}}

This is shown to be a special case of a more general relation.

===Stochastic energetics===

==History==
Classical thermodynamics, at its heart, deals with general laws governing the transformations of a system, in particular, those involving the exchange of heat, work and matter with an environment. As a central result, total entropy production is identified that in any such process can never decrease, leading, inter alia, to fundamental limits on the efficiency of heat engines and refrigerators.{{sfn|Seifert|2012|p=6}}

The thermodynamic characterisation of systems in equilibrium got its microscopic justification from equilibrium statistical mechanics which states that for a system in contact with a heat bath the probability to find it in any specific microstate is given by the Boltzmann factor. For small deviations from equilibrium, linear response theory allows to express transport properties caused by small external fields through equilibrium correlation functions. On a more phenomenological level, linear irreversible thermodynamics provides a relation between such transport coefficients and entropy production in terms of forces and fluxes. Beyond this linear response regime, for a long time, no universal exact results were available.{{sfn|Seifert|2012|p=6}}

During the last 20 years fresh approaches have revealed general laws applicable to non-equilibrium system thus pushing the range of validity of exact thermodynamic statements beyond the realm of linear response deep into the genuine non-equilibrium region. These exact results, which become particularly relevant for small systems with appreciable (typically non-Gaussian) fluctuations, generically refer to distribution functions of thermodynamic quantities like exchanged heat, applied work or entropy production.{{sfn|Seifert|2012|p=6}}

Stochastic thermodynamics combines the stochastic energetics introduced by {{harvp|Sekimoto|1998}}{{sfn|Seifert|2008|p=1}} with the idea that entropy can consistently be assigned to a single fluctuating trajectory.{{sfn|Seifert|2008|p=1}}

==Open research==
===Quantum stochastic thermodynamics===
{{main|Quantum thermodynamics}}
&lt;!--[[File:Microreversibility for non autonomous quantum systems.png|thumb|right|286x286px|Using the mathematical definitions of non-equilibrium quantum mechanical work it is possible describe work fluctuation relations in certain quantum systems. The principle of micro-reversibility holds for quantum systems in much the same way for the classical case: but not only must the momenta be inverted (applying Θ - the quantum mechanical time reversal operator) but also the temporal sequence of Hamiltonian values.{{sfn|Campisi et al.|2011|p=10}}]]--&gt;
Stochastic thermodynamics can be applied to driven (i.e. open) [[open quantum system|quantum systems]] whenever the effects of [[quantum coherence]] can be ignored. The dynamics of an open quantum system is then equivalent to a classical stochastic one.  However, this is sometimes at the cost of requiring unrealistic measurements at the beginning and end of a process.{{efn|name=quantum|See {{harvp|Esposito et al.|2009}} and {{harvp|Campisi et al.|2011}} for academic review articles on non-equilibrium quantum fluctuations{{sfn|Seifert|2012|p=9}} }}{{sfn|Seifert|2012|p=9}}

Understanding non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics more broadly is an important and active area of research. The efficiency of some computing and information theory tasks can be greatly enhanced when using [[Quantum correlation|quantum correlated]] states; quantum correlations can be used not as a valuable resource in quantum computation, but also in the realm of quantum thermodynamics.{{sfn|Dillenschneider|Lutz|2009|p=6}} New types of quantum devices in non-equilibrium states function very differently to their classical counterparts.  For example, it has been theoretically shown that non-equilibrium quantum ratchet systems function far more efficiently then that predicted by classical thermodynamics.{{efn|See for example {{harvp|Yukawa et al.|1997}}, {{harvp|Reimann et al.|1997}}, {{harvp|Tatara et al.|1998}}{{sfn|Yukawa|2000|p=1}} }}{{sfn|Yukawa|2000|p=1}}  It has also been shown that [[quantum coherence]] can be used to enhance the efficiency of systems beyond the classical [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot limit]]. This is because it could be possible to extract work, in the form of photons, from a single heat bath. Quantum coherence can be used in effect to play the role of [[Maxwell's demon]]{{sfn|Maruyama et al.|2009|p=20}} though it should be emphasized that the broader information theory based interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics is not violated.{{efn|See for example {{harvp|Scully|2001}},{{sfnm|1a1=Horodecki et al.|1y=2009|1p=80|2a1=Maruyama et al.|2y=2009|2p=20}}
{{harvp|Scully et al.|2003}},{{sfn|Maruyama et al.|2009|p=20}} {{harvp|Dillenschneider|Lutz|2009}},{{sfn|Modi et al.|2012|p=43}} {{harvp|Roßnagel et al.|2014}},{{Sfnm|1a1=Johannes Gutenberg Universitaet Mainz|1y=2014|2a1=Zyga|2y=2014}} and {{harvp|Roßnagel et al.|2016}}{{sfn|Cartlidge|2015}} }}{{sfn|Dillenschneider|Lutz|2009|pp=5-6}}

Quantum versions of stochastic thermodynamics have been studied for some time{{efn|See for example {{harvp|Yukawa|2000}}{{sfnm|1a1=Esposito et al.|1y=2009|1p=2|2a1=Jarzynski|2y=2011|2p=348|3a1=Campisi et al.|3y=2011|3p=8}}  and {{harvp|Mukamel|2003}}{{sfnm|1a1=Esposito et al.|1y=2009|1p=2, 8|2a1=Jarzynski|2y=2011|2p=348|3a1=Campisi et al.|3y=2011|3p=13}} }} and the past few years have seen a surge of interest in this topic.{{efn|name=quantum}} Quantum mechanics involves profound issues around the interpretation of reality (e.g. the [[Copenhagen interpretation]], [[many-worlds]], [[de Broglie-Bohm theory]] etc are all competing interpretations that try to explain the unintuitive results of quantum theory) . It is hoped that by trying to specify the quantum-mechanical definition of work, dealing with open quantum systems, analyzing exactly solvable models, or proposing and performing experiments to test non-equilibrium predictions,{{efn| See for example {{harvp|Huber et al.|2008}}{{sfnm|1a1=Campisi et al.|1y=2011|1p=16|2a1=Jarzynski|2y=2011|2p=348}} and {{harvp|An et al.|2014}}{{sfn|Roßnagel et al.|2016|p=1}} }} important insights into the interpretation of quantum mechanics and the true nature of reality will be gained.{{sfn|Jarzynski|2011|p=348}}

Applications of non-equilibrium work relations, like the Jarzynski equality, have recently been proposed for the purposes of detectiing [[quantum entanglement]] {{harv|Hide|Vedral|2010}} and to improving optimization problems (minimize or maximize a function of multivariables called the [[Loss function|cost function]]) via [[quantum annealing]] {{harv|Ohzeki|Nishimori|2011}}.{{sfn|Jarzynski|2011|p=348}}

===Active baths===
&lt;!--[[File:Active particles herd the passive particles favouring the formation of metastable clusters.png|thumb|286x286px|left|An experiment by {{harvp|Kümmel et al.|2015}} demonstrating that the dynamics and properties of passive particles are strongly influenced by adding a very small number of active particles. Active particle herd around passive particles favouring the formation of metastable clusters.{{sfn|Bechinger et al.|2016|p=26}}]]--&gt;
Until recently thermodynamics has only considered systems coupled to a thermal bath and, therefore, satisfying [[Boltzmann statistics]]. However, systems satisfying these conditions do not include many systems that are far from equilibrium such as living matter, for which fluctuations are expected to be [[Gaussian function|non-Gaussian]].{{sfn|Bechinger et al.|2016|p=45}}

Active particle systems are able to take energy from their environment and drive themselves far from equilibrium. An important example of active matter is constituted by objects capable of self propulsion. Thanks to this property, they feature a series of novel behaviours that are not attainable by matter at thermal equilibrium, including, for example, swarming and the emergence of other collective properties.{{sfn|Bechinger et al.|2016|p=2}} A passive particle is considered in an active bath when it is in an environment where a wealth of active particles are present. These particles will exert nonthermal forces on the passive object so that it will experience non-thermal fluctuations and will behave widely different from a passive Brownian particle in a thermal bath. The presence of an active bath can significantly influence the microscopic thermodynamics of a particle. Experiments have suggested that the Jarzynski equality does not hold in some cases due to the presence of non-Boltzmann statistics in active baths.{{efn|See for example {{harvp|Argun et al.|2016}}{{sfn|Bechinger et al.|2016|p=12, 26, 45}} }} This observation points towards a new direction in the study of non-equilibrium statistical physics and stochastic thermodynamics, where also the environment itself is far from equilibrium.{{sfn|Bechinger et al.|2016|p=26}}

Active baths are a question of particular importance in biochemistry. For example, biomolecules within cells are coupled with an active bath due to the presence of molecular motors within the cytoplasm, which leads to striking and largely not yet understood phenomena such as the emergence of anomalous diffusion (Barkai et al., 2012). Also, protein folding might be facilitated by the presence of active fluctuations (Harder et al., 2014b) and active matter dynamics could play a central role in several biological functions (Mallory et al., 2015; Shin et al., 2015; Suzuki et al., 2015). It is an open question to what degree stochastic thermodynamics can be applied to systems coupled to active baths.{{sfn|Bechinger et al.|2016|p=45}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33198">The '''pseudo Jahn–Teller effect''' (PJTE), occasionally also known as '''second-order JTE''', is a direct extension of the [[Jahn–Teller effect]] (JTE) where [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] in polyatomic systems ([[molecules]] and [[solids]]) occurs even in [[Degenerate energy levels|nondegenerate electronic states]] under the influence of sufficiently low-lying excited states of appropriate symmetry.
"The pseudo Jahn–Teller effect is the only source of instability and distortions of high-symmetry configurations of polyatomic systems in nondegenerate states, and it contributes  significantly to the instability in degenerate states".&lt;ref name="Bersuker13"&gt;I. B. Bersuker, The Pseudo Jahn–Teller Effect – a Two-State Paradigm in Formation, Deformation, and Transformation of Molecular Systems and Solids, Chem. Rev., 113, 1351-1390 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In the first publication in 1957 on the (what is now called) pseudo Jahn–Teller effect (PJTE), Öpik and Pryce&lt;ref name="Öpik"&gt;U. Öpik, and M. H. L. Pryce, "Studies of the Jahn Teller Effect.1. A Survey of the Static Problem". Proc. R. Soc. A. 238 (1215): 425–447 (1957). doi:10.1098/rspa.1957.0010&lt;/ref&gt; showed that a small splitting of the degenerate electronic term does not necessarily remove the instability and distortion of the polyatomic system induced by the [[Jahn–Teller effect]] (JTE), provided the splitting is sufficiently small (the two split states remain “pseudodegenerate”), and the vibronic coupling between them is strong enough. From another perspective, the idea of vibronic admixture of different electronic terms by low-symmetry vibrations was introduced in 1933 by Herzberg and Teller&lt;ref&gt;G. Herzberg, and E. Teller, "Vibrational structure of electronic transitions for polyatomic molecules", Z. Phys. Chem. B, 21, 410 (1933).&lt;/ref&gt; to explore forbidden electronic transitions, and extended in the late 1950s by Murrell and Pople&lt;ref&gt;J. N. Murrell, and J. A. Pople, "The intensities of the symmetry-forbidden electronic bands of benzene", Proc. Phys. Soc. London, Ser. A, 69, 245 (1956).&lt;/ref&gt; and by Liehr.&lt;ref&gt;A. D. Liehr, "Interaction of the vibrational and electronic motion in some simple conjugated hydrocarbons. I. Exact calculation of the intensity of the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;1g&lt;/sub&gt; → &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;B1u, 1B2u, vibronic transitions of benzene", Z. Naturforsch. a 13, 311 (1958).&lt;/ref&gt;  The role of excited states in softening the ground state with respect to distortions in benzene was demonstrated qualitatively by Longuet-Higgins and Salem&lt;ref&gt;H. C. Longuet-Higgins, L. Salem, Proc. R. Soc. London, A 251, 172 (1959).&lt;/ref&gt; by analyzing the [[pi bond|π electron levels]] in the [[Hückel method|Hückel approximation]], while a general second-order perturbation formula for such vibronic softening was derived by Bader in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;R. F. W. Bader, Mol. Phys. 3, 137 (1960).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 Fulton and Gouterman&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Fulton and M. Gouterman, J. Chem. Phys. 35, 1059 (1961).&lt;/ref&gt; presented a symmetry analysis of the two-level case in [[dimer (chemistry)|dimer]]s and introduced the term "pseudo Jahn–Teller effect". The first application of the PJTE to solving a major solid-state structural problem with regard to the origin of [[ferroelectricity]] was published in 1966 by Bersuker,&lt;ref name="Bersuker66"&gt;I. B. Bersuker, "On the origin of ferroelectricity in perovskite-type crystals", Phys. Lett. 20, 589 (1966).&lt;/ref&gt; and the first book on the JTE covering the PJTE was published in 1972 by Englman.&lt;ref name="Englman72"&gt;R. Englman "The Jahn–Teller Effect in Molecules and Crystals", Wiley-Interscience, (1972). {{ISBN|9780471241683}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second-order perturbation approach was employed by Pearson in 1975 to predict instabilities and distortions in molecular systems;&lt;ref name="Pearson76"&gt;G. Pearson, "Symmetry Rules for Chemical Reactions. Orbital Topology for Elementary Processes", Wiley: New York, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; he called it "second-order JTE" (SOJTE). The first explanation of PJT origin of puckering distortion as due to the vibronic coupling to the excited state was given for the N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; radical by Borden, Davidson, and Feller in 1980&lt;ref&gt;W. T. Borden, E. R. Davidson, and D. Feller, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 102, 5302 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; (they called it "piramidalization"). Methods of numerical calculation of the PJT vibronic coupling effect with applications to spectroscopic problems were developed in the early 1980s&lt;ref&gt;H. Köppel, W. Domcke, and L. S.  Cederbaum, Adv. Chem. Phys. 57, 59 (1984); Adv. Chem. Phys.  67, 59 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;
	A significant step forward in this field was achieved in 1984 when it was shown by numerical calculations&lt;ref&gt;I. B. Bersuker, N. N. Gorinchoy, and V. Z. Polinger, "On the origin of dynamic instability of molecular systems", Theor. Chim. Acta, 66, 161 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; that the energy gap to the active excited state may not be the ultimate limiting factor in the PJTE, as there are two other compensating parameters in the condition of instability. It was also shown that, in extension of the initial definition,&lt;ref name="Öpik"/&gt; the PJT interacting electronic states are not necessarily components emerging from the same symmetry type (as in the split degenerate term). As a result, the applicability of the PJTE became ''a priory'' unlimited. Moreover, it was shown by Bersuker that the PJTE is the only source of instability of high-symmetry configurations of polyatomic systems in nondegenerate states (works cited in Refs.&lt;ref name="Bersuker13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BP89"&gt;I. B. Bersuker and V. Z. Polinger, "Vibronic Interactions in Molecules and Crystals", Springer-Verlag, Berlin-Heidelberg-New York, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bersuker06"&gt;I. B. Bersuker, "The Jahn–Teller effect", Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;), and degeneracy and pseudodegeneracy are the only source of [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] in matter in all its forms.&lt;ref name="Bersuker16"&gt;I. B. Bersuker, "Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Matter Induced by Degeneracy and Pseudodegeneracy", in Advances in Chemical Physics, Vol. 160, S. Rice and R. Dinner, eds., Wiley, New York, 2016, pp159-208.&lt;/ref&gt; The many applications of the PJTE to the study of a variety of properties of molecular systems and solids are reflected in a number of reviews and books &lt;ref name="Bersuker13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Englman72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson76"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BP89"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bersuker06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bersuker16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burdett80"&gt;J. K. Burdett, "Molecular Shapes. Theoretical Models of Inorganic Stereochemistry", Wiley: New York, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoffmann88"&gt;R. Hoffmann, "Solids and Surfaces: A Chemist’s View of Bonding in Extended Structures", VCH: New York, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;), as well as in proceedings of conferences on the JTE.

==Theoretical background==

===General theory===

The equilibrium geometry of any polyatomic system in nondegenerate states is defined as corresponding to the point of the minimum of the [[potential energy surface|adiabatic potential energy surface]] (APES), where its first derivatives are zero and the second derivatives are positive. Denote the energy of the system as a function of normal displacements Q&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; by E(Q&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;). At the point of minimum (Q&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;=0) of the APES the curvature K of E(Q&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;) in the Q direction,
 
	K = (d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;E/dQ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;                                         (1)

is positive, K &gt; 0. Very often the geometry of the system at this point of equilibrium on the APES does not coincide with the highest possible (or even with any high) symmetry expected from general symmetry considerations. For instance, linear molecules are bent at equilibrium, planar molecules are puckered, octahedral complexes are elongated, or compressed, or tilted, cubic crystals are tetragonally polarized (or have several structural phases), etc. The PJTE is the general driving force of all these distortions if they occur in the nondegenerate electronic states of the high-symmetry (reference) geometry.
	If at the reference configuration the system is structurally unstable with respect to some nuclear displacements Q&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;, than K &lt; 0 in this direction. The general formula for the energy is E = &lt;ψ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|H|ψ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;, where H is the Hamiltonian and ψ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the wavefunction of the nondegenerate ground state. Substituting E in Eq.(1), we get (omitting the α index for simplicity)&lt;ref name="Bersuker13"/&gt;

	K=K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;	         								                                                (2)

K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=&lt;ψ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|(d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H/dQ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|ψ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;         		                         (3)

K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;=-Σ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;|&lt;ψ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|(dH/dQ)&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/[E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;-E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]			                                                   (4)
 		 		 		 		 		
where ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are the wavefunctions of the excited states, and the K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; expression, obtained as a second order perturbation correction, is always negative, K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;0. Therefore, if K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;0, the K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; contribution is the only source of instability. The matrix elements in Eq. (4) are off-diagonal [[vibronic coupling]] constants,&lt;ref name="Englman72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BP89"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bersuker06"/&gt;

	 F&lt;sub&gt;0n&lt;/sub&gt;= &lt;ψ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|(dH/dQ)&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;	         	            	  (5)

They measure the mixing of the ground and excited states under the nuclear displacements Q, and therefore K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; is termed the vibronic contribution. Together with the K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; value and the energy gap 2∆&lt;sub&gt;0n&lt;/sub&gt;=E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;-E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; between the mixing states, F&lt;sub&gt;0n&lt;/sub&gt; are the main parameters of the PJTE (see below). 
In a series of papers beginning in 1980 (see references in &lt;ref name="Bersuker13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BP89"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bersuker06"/&gt;) it was proved that for any polyatomic system in the high-symmetry configuration

K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;0,	        			  (6)

and hence the vibronic contribution is the only source of instability of any polyatomic system in nondegenerate states.
If K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;0 for the high-symmetry configuration of any polyatomic system, then a negative curvature, K =(K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt; 0, can be achieved only due to the negative vibronic coupling component K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;, and only if |K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;|&gt; K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. It follows that any distortion of the high-symmetry configuration is due to, and only to the mixing of its ground state with excited electronic states by the distortive nuclear displacements realized via the [[vibronic coupling]] in Eq. (5). The latter softens the system with respect to certain nuclear displacements (K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;0), and if this softening is larger than the original (nonvibronic) hardness K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in this direction, the system becomes unstable with respect to the distortions under consideration, leading to its equilibrium geometry of lower symmetry, or to dissociation. 
There are many cases when neither the ground state is degenerate, nor is there a significant vibronic coupling to the lowest excited states to realize PJTE instability of the high-symmetry configuration of the system, and still there is a ground state equilibrium configuration with lower symmetry. In such cases the symmetry breaking is produced by a hidden PJTE (similar to a hidden JTE); it takes place due to a strong PJTE mixing of two excited states, one of which crosses the ground state to create a new (lower) minimum of the APES with a distorted configuration.&lt;ref name="Bersuker13"/&gt;

===The two-level problem===

The use of the second order perturbation correction, Eq. (4), for the calculation of the K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; value in the case of PJTE instability is incorrect because in this case |K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;|&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, meaning the first perturbation correction is larger than the main term, and hence the criterion of applicability of the [[perturbation theory]] in its simplest form does not hold. In this case, we should consider the contribution of the lowest excited states (that make the total curvature negative) in a pseudodegenerate problem of perturbation theory. For the simplest case when only one excited state creates the main instability of the ground state, we can treat the problem via a pseudodegenerate two-level problem, including the contribution of the higher, weaker-influencing states as a second order correction.&lt;ref name="Bersuker13"/&gt;
In the PJTE two-level problem we have two electronic states of the high-symmetry configuration, ground β and excited γ, separated by an energy interval of 2Δ, that become mixed under nuclear displacements of certain symmetry Q=Q&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;; the denotations α, β, and γ indicate, respectively, the irreducible representations to which the symmetry coordinate and the two states belong. In essence, this is the original formulation of the PJTE. Assuming that the excited state is sufficiently close to the ground one, the [[vibronic coupling]] between them should be treated as a perturbation problem for two near-degenerate states. With both interacting states non-degenerate the vibronic coupling constant F in Eq.(5) (omitting indices)is non-zero for only one coordinate Q=Q&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; with α=β×γ. This gives us directly the symmetry of the direction of softening and possible distortion of the ground state. Assuming that the primary force constants K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in the two states are the same (for different K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; see [1]), we get a 2×2 secular equation with the following solution for the energies ε&lt;sub&gt;±&lt;/sub&gt; of the two states interacting under the linear vibronic coupling (the energy is read off the middle of the 2Δ interval between the initial levels):

ε&lt;sub&gt;±&lt;/sub&gt;= (1/2)Q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;±[Δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+F&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;(1/2)&lt;/sup&gt;     (7)

It is seen from this expressions that, on taking into account the vibronic coupling, F≠0, the two APES curves change in different ways: in the upper sheet the curvature (the coefficient at Q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the expansion on Q) increases, whereas in the lower one it decreases.  But until (F&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;Δ the minima of both states correspond to the point Q = 0, as in the absence of vibronic mixing. However, if

(F&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)&gt;Δ								(8)

the curvature of the lower curve of the APES becomes negative, and the system is unstable with respect to the Q displacements (Fig. 1). The minima points on the APES in this case are given by

±Q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=[F&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-Δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/F&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;  (9)

From these expressions and Fig. 1 it is seen that while the ground state is softened (destabilized) by the PJTE, the excited state is hardened (stabilized), and this effect is the larger, the smaller Δ and the larger F. It takes place in any polyatomic system and influences many molecular properties, including the existence of stable excited states of molecular systems that are unstable in the ground state (e.g., excited states of intermediates of chemical reactions); in general, even in the absence of instability the PJTE softens the ground state and increases the vibrational frequencies in the excited state.

===Comparison with the JTE. Added covalency is driving PJTE distortions===

[[File:Jahn-Teller and pseudo Jahn-Teller effects.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Fig. 1. Energy profiles in a two-level PJTE (lower - b) versus the JTE (upper - a) in a single distortion coordinate Q.]]
The two branches of the APES for the case of strong PJTE resulting in the instability of the ground state (when the condition of instability (11) holds) are illustrated in Fig. 1b in comparison with the case when the two states have the same energy (Fig. 1a), i. e. when they are degenerate and the Jahn–Teller effect (JTE) takes place. We see that the two cases, degenerate and nondegenerate but close-in-energy (pseudodegenerate) are similar in generating two minima with distorted configurations, but there are important differences: while in the JTE there is a crossing of the two terms at the point of degeneracy (leading to conical intersections in more complicated cases), in the nondegenerate case with strong vibronic coupling there is an “avoided crossing” or “pseudo crossing”. Even a more important difference between the two vibronic coupling effects emerges from the fact that the two interacting states in the JTE are components of the same symmetry type, whereas in the PJTE each of the two states may have any symmetry. For this reason the possible kinds of distortion is very limited in the JTE, and unlimited in the PJTE. It is also noticeable that while the systems with JTE are limited by the condition of electron degeneracy, the applicability of the PJTE has no a priori limitations, as it includes also the cases of degeneracy. Even when the PJT coupling is weak and the inequality (11) does not hold, the PJTE is still significant in softening (lowering the corresponding vibrational frequency) of the ground state and increasing it in the excited state.&lt;ref name="Bersuker13"/&gt; When considering the PJTE in an excited state, all the higher in energy states destabilize it, while the lower ones stabilize it.

[[File:Fig. 2 Illustration to the origin of the PJTE as due to added covalence bonding by distortion.tif|thumb|Fig. 2. Illustration to the origin of the PJTE as due to added covalence bonding by distortion: (a) when the Fe atom in metalloporphyrins is in the porphyrin-ring in-plane position, the net overlap of its d&lt;sub&gt;z2&lt;/sub&gt; orbital with the near-neighbor nitrogen p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals is zero by symmetry, and these orbitals do not contribute to the bonding; (b) the out-of-plane displacement of Fe results in their non-zero overlap producing a covalence contribution to the bonding]]
For a better understanding it is important to follow up on how the PJTE is related to intramolecular interactions. In other words, what is the physical driving force of the PJTE distortions (transformations) in terms of well-known electronic structure and bonding? The driving force of the PJTE is added (improved) covalence: the PJTE distortion takes place when it results in energy gain due to better covalence bonding between the atoms in the distorted configuration.&lt;ref name="Bersuker13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bersuker06"/&gt; Indeed, in the starting high-symmetry configuration the wavefunctions of the electronic states, ground and excited, are orthogonal by definition. By distortion their orthogonality is violated, and a nonzero overlap between them occurs. If for two near-neighbor atoms the ground state wavefunction pertains (mainly) to one of them, while the excited state wavefunction belongs (mainly) to the other one, the overlap by distortion adds covalency to the bonding between them, facilitating the distortion (Fig. 2).

==Applications==
Applications of the PJTE to solving chemical, physical, biological, and [[materials science]] problems are innumerable; as stated above, the PJTE is the only source of instability and distortions in high-symmetry configurations of molecular systems and solids with nondegenerate states, hence any problem steaming from such instability can be treated by the PJTE. Below are some illustrative examples.

=== Linear systems ===
'''PJTE versus [[Renner–Teller effect]] in bending distortions'''. Linear molecules are exceptions from the JTE, and for a long time it was assumed that their bending distortions in degenerate states (observed in many molecules) is produced by the Renner–Teller effect (RTE) (the splitting of the generate state by the quadratic terms of the vibronic coupling). However, recently it was proved (see in the review &lt;ref name="Bersuker13"/&gt;) that the RTE, by splitting the degenerate electronic state, just softens the lower branch of the APES, but this lowering of the energy is not enough to overcome the rigidity of the linear configuration and to produce bending distortions. It follows that the bending distortion of linear molecular systems is due to, and only to the PJTE that mixes the electronic state under consideration with higher in energy (excited) states. This statement is enhanced by the fact that many linear molecules in nondegenerate states (and hence with no RTE) are, too, bent in the equilibrium configuration. The physical reason for the difference between the PJTE and the RTE in influencing the degenerate term is that while in the former case the vibronic coupling with the excited state produces additional covalent bonding that makes the distorted configuration preferable (see above, section 2.3), the RTE has no such influence; the splitting of the degenerate term in the RTE takes place just because the charge distribution in the two states becomes nonequivalent under the bending distortion.

'''[[Peierls distortion]]s in linear chains'''. In linear molecules with three or more atoms there may be PJTE distortions that do not violate the linearity but change the interatomic distances. For instance, as a result of the PJTE a centrosymmetric linear system may become non-centrosymmetric in the equilibrium configurations, as, for example, in the BNB molecule (see in &lt;ref name="Bersuker13"/&gt;). An interesting extension of such distortions in sufficiently long (infinite) linear chains was first considered by Peierls.&lt;ref&gt;R. E. Peierls "Quantum theory of solids", Oxford, Clarendon, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case the electronic states, combinations of atomic states, are in fact band states, and it was shown that if the chain is composed by atoms with unpaired electrons, the valence band is only half filled, and the PJTE interaction between the occupied and unoccupied band states leads to the doubling of the period of the linear chain (see also in the books &lt;ref name="BP89"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bersuker06"/&gt;).
 
'''Broken cylindrical symmetry'''. It was shown also that the PJTE not only produces the bending instability of linear molecules, but if the mixing electronic states involve a Δ state (a state with a nonzero momentum with respect to the axis of the molecule, its projection quantum number being Λ=2), the APES, simultaneously with the bending, becomes warped along the coordinate of rotations around the molecular axis, thus violating both the linear and cylindrical symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;W. Hermoso, Y. Liu, and I. B. Bersuker, "A Novel Effect Induced by Pseudo Jahn–Teller Interactions: Broken Cylindrical Symmetry in Linear Molecules", J. Chem. Theory Comput., 10, 4377 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; It happens because the PJTE, by mixing the wavefunctions of the two interacting states, transfers the high momentum of the electrons from states with Λ=2 to states with lower momentum, and this may alter significantly their expected rovibronic spectra.

=== Nonlinear molecules and two-dimensional (2D) systems===
'''PJTE and combined PJTE plus JTE effects in molecular structures'''. There is a practically unlimited number of molecular systems for which the origin of their structural properties was revealed and/or rationalized based on the PJTE, or a combination of the PJTE and JTE. The latter stems from the fact that in any system with a JTE in the ground state the presence of a PJT active excited state is not excluded, and vice versa, the active excited state for the PJTE of the ground one may be degenerate, and hence JT active. Examples are shown, e.g., in Refs.,&lt;ref name="Bersuker13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Englman72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson76"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BP89"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bersuker16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burdett80"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoffmann88"/&gt; including molecular systems like Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (X= H, F, Cl, Br), CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (with R as large ligands), planar cyclic C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, all kind of coordination systems of transition metals, mixed-valence compounds, biological systems, origin of conformations, geometry of ligands’ coordination, etc., etc. In fact it is difficult to find a molecular system for which the PJTE implications are a priori excluded, which is understandable in view of the mentioned above unique role of the PJTE in such instabilities.

'''Hidden PJTE, [[spin crossover]], and [[magnetic-dielectric bistability]]'''. As mentioned above, there are molecular systems in which the ground state in the high-symmetry configuration is neither degenerate to trigger the JTE, nor does it interact with the low-lying excited states to produce the PJTE (e.g., because of their different spin multiplicity). In these situations the instability is produced by a strong PJTE in the excited states; this is termed “hidden PJTE” in the sense that its origin is not seen explicitly as a PJTE in the ground state. An interesting typical situation of hidden PJTE emerges in molecular and solid state systems with valence half-filed closed shells electronic configurations e&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and t&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. For instance, in the e&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; case the ground state in the high-symmetry equilibrium geometry is an orbital non-degenerate triplet &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;A, while the nearby low-lying two excited electronic states are close-in-energy singlets &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;E and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A; due to the strong PJT interaction between the latter, the lower component of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;E crosses the triplet state to produce a global minimum with lower symmetry. Fig. 3 illustrates the hidden PJTE in the CuF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; molecule, showing also the singlet-triplet spin crossover and the resulting two coexisting configurations of the molecule: high-symmetry (undistorted) spin-triplet state with a nonzero magnetic moment, and a lower in energy dipolar-distorted singlet state with zero magnetic moment. Such [[magnetic-dielectric bistability]] is inherent to a whole class of molecular systems and solids.&lt;ref name="GB12"&gt;P. Garcia-Fernandez and I. B. Bersuker, Class of molecular and solid state systems with correlated magnetic and dielectric bistabilities induced by the pseudo Jahn–Teller effect, Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 246406 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Puckering in planar molecules and graphene-like 2D and quasi 2D systems'''. Special attention has been paid recently to two-dimensional (2D) systems in view of a variety of their planar-surface-specific physical and chemical properties and possible graphene-like applications in electronics. Similar-to-[[graphene]] properties are sought for in silicene, phosphorene, boron nitride, zinc oxide, gallium nitride, as well as in other attractive subjects like 2D transition metal dichalcogenids and oxides, and there is a number of other organic and inorganic 2D and quasi-2D compounds with expected similar properties. One of the main important features of these systems is their planarity or quasi-planarity, but many of the quasi-2D compounds are subject to out-of-plane deviations known as puckering (buckling). It was shown, as expected, that the instability and distortions of the planar configuration (as in any other systems in nondegenerate state) is due to the PJTE.&lt;ref name="Bersuker13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BP89"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bersuker06"/&gt; Detailed exploration of the PJTE in such systems allows one to reveal the excited states that are responsible for the puckering, and suggest possible external influence that restores their planarity, including oxidation, reduction, substitutions, or coordination to other species.&lt;ref name="Bersuker06"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I. B. Bersuker, The Jahn–Teller and pseudo Jahn–Teller effect in materials science, in Proc. 23th International conference on the Jahn–Teller effect, J. Phys. Conf. Series, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solid state and materials science ===
'''Cooperative PJTE in [[BaTiO3|BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]-type crystals and [[ferroelectricity]]'''. In crystals with PJTE centers the interaction between the local distortions may lead to their ordering to produce a phase transition to a regular crystal phase with lower symmetry. Such cooperative PJTE is quite similar to the cooperative JTE; it was shown in one of the first applications of the PJTE to solid state systems &lt;ref name="Bersuker66"/&gt; that in case of ABO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crystals with perovskite structure the local dipolar PJTE distortions at the transition metal B center and their cooperative interactions leads to ferroelectric phase transitions. Provided the criterion of PJTE is obeyed, each [BO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] center has an APES with eight equivalent minima along the trigonal axes, six orthorhombic, and (higher) twelve tetragonal saddle-points between them. With temperature, the gradually reached transitions between the minima via the different kind of saddle-points explains the origin of all the four phases (three ferroelectric and one paraelectric) in perovskites of the type BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and their properties. The predicted by the theory trigonal displacement of the Ti ion in all four phases, the fully disordered PJTE distortions in the paraelectric phase, and their partially disordered state in two other phases was confirmed by a variety of experimental investigations (see in &lt;ref name="Bersuker13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bersuker66"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BP89"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bersuker06"/&gt;).

'''[[Multiferroicity]] and magnetic-ferroelectric crossover'''. The PJTE theory of [[ferroelectricity]] in ABO3 crystals was expanded to show that, dependent of the number of electrons in the d&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; shell of the transition metal ion B&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; and their low spin or high spin arrangement (which controls the symmetry and spin multiplicity of the ground and PJTE active excited states of the [BO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] center), their ferroelectricity may coexist with a magnetic moment ([[multiferroicity]]). Moreover, in combination with the temperature dependent spin crossover phenomenon (which changes the spin multiplicity), this kind of multiferroicity may lead to a novel effect of magnetic-ferroelectric crossover.&lt;ref&gt;I. B. Bersuker, Pseudo Jahn–Teller Origin of Perovskite Multiferroics, Magnetic-Ferroelectric Crossover, and Magnetoelectric Effects. The d&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;-d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; problem, Phys. Rev. Lett., 108, 137202 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Solid state magnetic-dielectric bistability'''. Similar to the mentioned above molecular bistability induced by the hidden PJTE, a magnetic-dielectric bistability due to two coexisting equilibrium configurations with corresponding properties may take place also in crystals with transition metal centers, subject to the electronic configuration with half-filled e&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or t&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; shells.&lt;ref name="GB12"/&gt; As in molecular systems, the latter produce a hidden PJTE and local bistability which, distinguished from the molecular case, are enhanced by the cooperative interactions, thus acquiring larger lifetimes. This crystal bistability was proved by calculations for LiCuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NaCuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; crystals, in which the Cu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ion has the electronic e&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(d&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;) configuration (similar to the CuF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; molecule).&lt;ref name="GB12"/&gt;
 
'''Giant enhancement of observable properties in interaction with external perturbations'''. In a recent development of the PJTE applications in materials science it was shown that in crystals with PJTE centers, in which the local distortion are not ordered (before the phase transition to the cooperative phases), the effect of interaction with external perturbations acquires an orientational contribution which enhances the observable properties by several orders of magnitude. This was demonstrated on the properties of crystals like paraelectric BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in interaction with electric fields (in [[permittivity]] and [[electrostriction]]), or under a strain gradient ([[flexoelectricity]]). These giant enhancement effects occur due to the dynamic nature of the PJTE local dipolar distortions (their tunneling between the equivalent minima); the independently rotating dipole moments on each center become oriented (frozen) along the external perturbation resulting in an orientational polarization which is not there in the absence of the PJTE&lt;ref&gt;I. B. Bersuker, Giant Permittivity and Electrostriction induced by Dynamic Jahn–Teller and Pseudo Jahn–Teller Effects, Appl. Phys. Lett. 107, 202904 (2015); Pseudo Jahn–Teller effect in the origin of enhanced flexoelectricity, Appl. Phys. Lett. 106, 022903 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7993">In [[classical mechanics]], '''action-angle coordinates''' are a set of [[canonical coordinates]] useful in solving many [[integrable system]]s. The method of action-angles is useful for obtaining the [[frequency|frequencies]] of oscillatory or rotational motion without solving the [[equations of motion]].  Action-angle coordinates are chiefly used when the [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]]s are completely separable.  (Hence, the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] does not depend explicitly on time, i.e., the [[conservation of energy|energy is conserved]].) Action-angle variables define an '''invariant torus''', so called because holding the action constant defines the surface of a [[torus]], while the angle variables parameterize the coordinates on the torus.

The [[Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization]] conditions, used to develop quantum mechanics before the advent of [[Schrödinger equation#Particles as waves|wave mechanics]], state that the action must be an integral multiple of [[Planck's constant]]; similarly, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s insight into [[Einstein–Brillouin–Keller method|EBK quantization]] and the difficulty of quantizing non-integrable systems was expressed in terms of the invariant tori of action-angle coordinates.

Action-angle coordinates are also useful in [[perturbation theory]] of [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], especially in determining [[adiabatic invariant]]s. One of the earliest results from [[chaos theory]], for the non-linear  perturbations of dynamical systems with a small number of degrees of freedom is the [[KAM theorem]], which states that the invariant tori are stable under small perturbations.

The use of action-angle variables was central to the solution of the [[Toda lattice]], and to the definition of [[Lax pairs]], or more generally, the idea of the [[isospectral]] evolution of  a system.

==Derivation==
Action angles result from a [[Canonical_transformation#Type_2_generating_function|type-2]] [[canonical transformation]] where the generating function is [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation|Hamilton's characteristic function]] &lt;math&gt;W(\mathbf{q})&lt;/math&gt; (''not'' Hamilton's principal function &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;).  Since the original Hamiltonian does not depend on time explicitly, the new Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;K(\mathbf{w}, \mathbf{J})&lt;/math&gt; is merely the old Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p})&lt;/math&gt; expressed in terms of the new [[canonical coordinates]], which we denote as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt; (the '''action angles''', which are the [[generalized coordinates]]) and their new generalized momenta &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}&lt;/math&gt;.  We will not need to solve here for the generating function &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; itself; instead, we will use it merely as a vehicle for relating the new and old [[canonical coordinates]].

Rather than defining the action angles &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt; directly, we define instead their generalized momenta, which resemble the [[action (physics)|classical action]] for each original [[generalized coordinate]]

:&lt;math&gt;
J_{k} \equiv \oint p_k \, \mathrm{d}q_k
&lt;/math&gt;

where the integration path is implicitly given by the constant energy function &lt;math&gt;E=E(q_k,p_k)&lt;/math&gt;.  Since the actual motion is not involved in this integration, these generalized momenta &lt;math&gt;J_k&lt;/math&gt; are constants of the motion, implying that the transformed Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on the conjugate [[generalized coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;w_k&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} J_{k} = 0 = \frac{\partial K}{\partial w_k}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;w_k&lt;/math&gt; are given by the typical equation for a type-2 [[canonical transformation]]

:&lt;math&gt;
w_k \equiv \frac{\partial W}{\partial J_k}
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, the new Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;K=K(\mathbf{J})&lt;/math&gt; depends only on the new generalized momenta &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}&lt;/math&gt;.

The dynamics of the action angles is given by [[Hamilton's equations]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} w_k = \frac{\partial K}{\partial J_k} \equiv \nu_k(\mathbf{J})
&lt;/math&gt;

The right-hand side is a constant of the motion (since all the &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;'s are).  Hence, the solution is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
w_k = \nu_k(\mathbf{J}) t + \beta_k
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\beta_k&lt;/math&gt; is a constant of integration.  In particular, if the original [[generalized coordinate]] undergoes an oscillation or rotation of period &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, the corresponding action angle &lt;math&gt;w_k&lt;/math&gt; changes by &lt;math&gt;\Delta w_k = \nu_k (\mathbf{J}) T&lt;/math&gt;.

These &lt;math&gt;\nu_k(\mathbf{J})&lt;/math&gt; are the frequencies of oscillation/rotation for the original [[generalized coordinate]]s &lt;math&gt;q_k&lt;/math&gt;.  To show this, we integrate the net change in the action angle &lt;math&gt;w_k&lt;/math&gt; over exactly one complete variation (i.e., oscillation or rotation) of its [[generalized coordinate]]s &lt;math&gt;q_k&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta w_k \equiv \oint \frac{\partial w_k}{\partial q_k} \, \mathrm{d}q_k = 
\oint \frac{\partial^2 W}{\partial J_k \, \partial q_k} \, \mathrm{d}q_k = 
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}J_k} \oint \frac{\partial W}{\partial q_k} \, \mathrm{d}q_k = 
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}J_k} \oint p_k \, \mathrm{d}q_k = \frac{\mathrm{d}J_k}{\mathrm{d}J_k} = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

Setting the two expressions for &lt;math&gt;\Delta w_{k}&lt;/math&gt; equal, we obtain the desired equation

:&lt;math&gt; 
\nu_k(\mathbf{J}) = \frac{1}{T}
&lt;/math&gt;

The action angles &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt; are an independent set of [[generalized coordinates]].  Thus, in the general case, each original generalized coordinate &lt;math&gt;q_{k}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as a [[Fourier series]] in ''all'' the action angles

:&lt;math&gt;
q_k = \sum_{s_1=-\infty}^\infty \sum_{s_2 = -\infty}^\infty \cdots \sum_{s_N = -\infty}^\infty A^k_{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_N} e^{i2\pi s_1 w_1} e^{i2\pi s_2 w_2} \cdots e^{i2\pi s_N w_N}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A^k_{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_N}&lt;/math&gt; is the Fourier series coefficient.  In most practical cases, however, an original generalized coordinate &lt;math&gt;q_k&lt;/math&gt; will be expressible as a [[Fourier series]] in only its own action angles &lt;math&gt;w_k&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
q_k = \sum_{s_k=-\infty}^\infty A^k_{s_k} e^{i2\pi s_k w_k}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Summary of basic protocol==

The general procedure has three steps:

# Calculate the new generalized momenta &lt;math&gt;J_{k}&lt;/math&gt; 
# Express the original Hamiltonian entirely in terms of these variables.
# Take the derivatives of the Hamiltonian with respect to these momenta to obtain the frequencies &lt;math&gt;\nu_k&lt;/math&gt;

==Degeneracy==

In some cases, the frequencies of two different [[generalized coordinate]]s are identical, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\nu_k = \nu_l&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k \neq l&lt;/math&gt;.  In such cases, the motion is called '''degenerate'''.

Degenerate motion signals that there are additional general conserved quantities; for example, the frequencies of the [[Kepler problem]] are degenerate, corresponding to the conservation of the [[Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector]].

Degenerate motion also signals that the [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]]s are completely separable in more than one coordinate system; for example, the Kepler problem is completely separable in both [[spherical coordinates]] and [[parabolic coordinates]].

{{Multiple issues|{{copy edit|date=November 2018}}{{sections|date=November 2018}}}}This branch of [[spectroscopy]] deals with radiation related to [[atom]]s that are stripped of several electrons (multiply ionized atoms (MIA), multiply charged ions, highly charged [[ion]]s). These are observed in very [[Plasma (physics)|hot plasmas]] (laboratory or astrophysical) or in [[Accelerator physics|accelerator]] experiments ([[Particle accelerator|beam-foil]], [[electron beam ion trap]] (EBIT)). The lowest exited electron shells of such ions decay into stable ground states producing photons in [[Ultraviolet|VUV]], [[Extreme ultraviolet|EUV]] and soft [[X-ray]] spectral regions (so-called resonance transitions).

Later [[Robert Bunsen|Bunsen]] and [[Gustav Kirchhoff|Kirchhoff]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bunsen|first=R.|last2=Kirchhoff|first2=G.|date=1861|title=Untersuchungen über das Sonnenspektrum und die Spektren der Chemischen Elemente|url=|journal=Abhandl.

Berlin|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that [[Fraunhofer lines]] correspond to emission spectral lines observed in laboratory light sources, and so they laid way for [[Spectrochemical Analysis|spectrochemical analysis]] in laboratory and astrophysics.

In the 19th century new developments such as the discovery of photography, [[Henry Augustus Rowland|Rowland's]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/14786448208627217 | title=LXI.

In 1913 [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bohr|first=N.|date=1913|title=Abhandlungen ueber Atombau|url=|journal=Phil.

Between 1920 and 1930 fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics were developed by [[Wolfgang Pauli|Pauli]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pauli|first=W.|date=1925|title=Über den Zusammenhang des Abschlusses der Elektronengruppen im Atom mit der Komplexstruktur der Spektren|url=|journal=Zeitschrift für Physik|volume=31|pages=765–783|doi=10.1007/BF02980631|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heisenberg|first=W.|date=1925|title=Über quantentheoretische Umdeutung kinematischer und mechanischer Beziehungen|url=|journal=Zeitschrift für Physik|volume=33|pages=879–893|doi=10.1007/BF01328377|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schrödinger|first=E.|date=1926|title=An Undulatory Theory of the Mechanics of Atoms and Molecules|url=|journal=Phys.

Further progress in studies of atomic structure was in tight connection with the advance to shorter [[wavelength]] in EUV region.

In the same period [[Manne Siegbahn]] constructed a very sophisticated grazing incidence spectrograph that enabled Ericson and [[Bengt Edlén|Edlén]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ericson|first=A.|last2=Edlén|first2=B.|date=1930|title=Serienspektren der leichtesten Elemente im extremen Ultraviolett|url=|journal=Z. Phys.|volume=59|pages=656–679|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to obtain spectra of vacuum spark with high quality and to reliably identify lines of multiply ionized atoms up to O VI, with five stripped electrons. [[Walter Grotrian|Grotrian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Graphische Darstellung der Spektren von Atomen und Ionen mit ein, zwei und drei Valenzelektronen|last=Grotrian|first=W.|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1928|isbn=|editor-last=Born|editor-first=M.|location=Berlin|pages=|editor-last2=Franck|editor-first2=J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed his graphic presentation of energy structure of the atoms. [[Henry Norris Russell|Russel]] and Saunders&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Russel|first=H.N.|last2=Saunders|first2=F.A.|date=1925|title=New Regularities in the Spectra of the Alkaline Earths|url=|journal=Astrophys. J.|volume=61|pages=38|doi=10.1086/142872|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed their [[Angular momentum coupling|coupling]] scheme for the spin-orbit interaction and their generally recognized notation for [[Term symbol|spectral terms]].

Theoretical quantum-mechanical calculations become rather accurate to describe the energy structure of some simple electronic configurations. The results of theoretical developments were summarized by [[Edward Condon|Condon]] and Shortley&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Theory of Atomic Spectra|last=Condon|first=E.U.|last2=Shortley|first2=G.H.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1935|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1935.

[[Bengt Edlén|Edlén]] thoroughly analyzed spectra of MIA for many chemical elements and derived regularities in energy structures of MIA for many isoelectronic sequences (ions with the same number of electrons, but different nuclear charges). Spectra of rather high ionization stages (e.g. Cu XIX) were observed.

The most exciting event was in 1942, when [[Bengt Edlén|Edlén]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edlén|first=B.|date=1942|title=Die Deutung der Emissionslinien im Spectrum der Sonnenkorona|url=|journal=Z. Astrophys.|volume=20|pages=30|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; proved the identification of some solar coronal lines on the basis of his precise analyses of spectra of MIA. This implied that the [[Corona|solar corona]] has a temperature of a million degrees, and strongly advanced understanding of solar and stellar physics.

After the [[World War II|WW II]] experiments on balloons and rockets were started to observe the VUV radiation of the Sun. (See [[X-ray astronomy]]). More intense research continued since 1960 including [[spectrometer]]s on satellites.

In the same period the laboratory spectroscopy of MIA becomes relevant as a diagnostic tool for hot plasmas of thermonuclear devices (see [[Nuclear fusion]]) which begun with building [[Stellarator]] in 1951 by Spitzer, and continued with [[tokamak]]s, z-pinches and the laser produced plasmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martinson|first=I.|last2=Jupén|first2=C.|date=2003|title=Atomic Structure Studies Using Fusion Plasmas|url=|journal=Phys.

Simultaneously theoretical and computational approaches provided data necessary for identification of new spectra and interpretation of observed line intensities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Judd|first=B.R.|date=1988|editor-last=Gschneidner, Jr|editor-first=K.A.|editor2-last=Eyring|editor2-first=L.|title=Atomic Theory and Optical Spectroscopy|url=|journal=Handbook on the Physics and Chemistry of Rare Earths|volume=11|pages=81–195|doi=10.1016/S0168-1273(88)11006-4|via=|isbn=9780444870803}}&lt;/ref&gt; New laboratory and theoretical data become very useful for spectral observation in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doschek|first=G.A.|last2=Feldman|first2=U.|date=2010|title=The Solar UV-X-ray Spectrum from 1.5 to 2000 Å|url=|journal=J.

A new page in the spectroscopy of MIA may be dated as 1986 with development of [[Electron beam ion trap|EBIT]] (Levine and Marrs, [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|LLNL]]) due to a favorable composition of modern high technologies such as [[cryogenics]], [[ultra-high vacuum]], [[superconducting magnet]]s, powerful [[Electron-beam technology|electron beams]] and [[semiconductor detector]]s. Very quickly EBIT sources were created in many countries (see [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] summary&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/pml/quantum-measurement/atomic-spectroscopy/electron-beam-ion-trap-ebit|title=Electron Beam Ion Trap (EBIT)|last=|first=|date=2009-10-06|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for many details as well as reviews&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beiersdorfer|first=P.|date=2009|title=Spectroscopy with trapped highly charged ions|url=https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/357087.pdf|journal=Phys.

A wide field of spectroscopic research with EBIT is enabled including achievement of highest grades of ionization (U&lt;sup&gt;92+&lt;/sup&gt;), wavelength measurement, [[hyperfine structure]] of energy levels, [[Quantum electrodynamics|quantum electrodynamic]] studies, ionization [[Cross section (physics)|cross-sections]] (CS) measurements, electron-impact excitation CS, X-ray [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]], relative line intensities, dielectronic [[Recombination (physics)|recombination]] CS, magnetic octupole decay, lifetimes of [[Forbidden mechanism|forbidden transitions]], charge-exchange recombination, etc.

'''''Vaiśeṣika Sūtra''''', (Sanskrit: वैशेषिक सूत्र), also called '''''Kanada sutra''''', is an ancient [[Sanskrit]] text at the foundation of the [[Vaisheshika]] school of [[Hindu philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constance Jones|author2=James D.

Fowler|2002|pp=98–99}} According to some scholars, he flourished before the advent of [[Buddhism]] because the ''Vaiśeṣika Sūtra'' makes no mention of Buddhism or Buddhist doctrines;&lt;ref&gt;Lal, Mohan. Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: Sasay to Zorgot, Volume 5. P. 3968. {{ISBN|9993154229}}.&lt;/ref&gt; however, the details of Kanada's life are uncertain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Emmie te Nijenhuis|title=Musicological literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HkUIAQAAIAAJ|year=1977|publisher=Harrassowitz|isbn=978-3-447-01831-9|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Vaiśeṣika Sūtra'' was likely compiled sometime between 6th and 2nd century BCE,{{Sfn|Jeaneane D. Fowler|2002|pp=98-99}}{{Sfn|H. Margenau|2012|p=xxx-xxxi}} and finalized in the currently existing version before the start of the common era.{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|p=54}}

A number of scholars have commented on it since the beginning of common era; the earliest commentary known is the ''Padartha Dharma Sangraha'' of [[Prashastapada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chandradhar Sharma|title=A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3gQVd5WogsC |year=2000|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0365-7|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|pp=62-63}} Another important secondary work on ''Vaiśeṣika Sūtra'' is Maticandra's ''Dasha padartha sastra'' which exists both in Sanskrit and its Chinese translation in 648&amp;nbsp;CE by Yuanzhuang.{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|p=63}}

The ''Vaiśeṣika Sūtra'' is written in aphoristic sutras style,{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|p=53}} and presents its theories on the creation and existence of the universe using naturalistic [[atomism]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/early-modern-india/ Analytic Philosophy in Early Modern India] J Ganeri, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (2014);&lt;br&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism-india/ Naturalism in Classical Indian Philosophy], A Chatterjee, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; applying logic and realism, and is one of the earliest known systematic realist [[ontology]] in human history.{{Sfn|Jeaneane D. Fowler|2002|p=98}} The text discusses motions of different kind and laws that govern it, the meaning of [[dharma]], a theory of [[epistemology]], the basis of [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (self, soul), and the nature of [[yoga]] and [[moksha]].{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|pp=56-59}}&lt;ref&gt;Translation of critical edition of ''Vaiśeṣika Sūtra'': John Wells (2009), [http://darshanapress.com/The%20Vaisheshika%20Darshana.pdf The Vaisheshika Darshana], Darshana Press; Discussion: {{cite book|author=Shyam Ranganathan|title=Ethics and the History of Indian Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x89I_zEGPhkC |year=2007|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-3193-3 |pages=344–348 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On yoga and moksha in Vaisesika Sutras: {{cite book|author=Johannes Bronkhorst|title=The Two Traditions of Meditation in Ancient India|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AZbZDP8MRJoC&amp;pg=PA64|year=1993|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1114-0|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The explicit mention of motion as the cause of all phenomena in the world and several propositions about it make it one of the earliest texts on physics.

==Etymology==
The name ''Vaiśeṣika Sūtra'' (Sanskrit: वैशेषिक सूत्र) is derived from ''viśeṣa'', विशेष, which means "particularity", that is to be contrasted  from "universality". &lt;ref name="Halbfass1992p272"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wilhelm Halbfass|title=On Being and What There Is: Classical Vaisesika and the History of Indian Ontology| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x7cLHPj1dj8C&amp;pg=PA272| year=1992| publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-0-7914-1178-0|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classes particularity and universality belong to different categories of experience.

==Manuscripts==
Till the 1950s, only one manuscript of ''Vaiseshika sutra'' was known and this manuscript was part of a [[bhasya]] by the 15th century Sankaramisra.{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|pp=55-56}} Scholars had doubted its authenticity, given the inconsistencies in this manuscript and the quotes in other Hindu, Jaina and Buddhist literature claiming to be from the ''Vaisheshika Sutra''. In the 1950s and early 1960s, new manuscripts of ''Vaiśeṣika Sūtra'' were discovered in distant parts of India, which were later identified as this Sutra.{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|pp=55-56}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wilhelm Halbfass|title=On Being and What There Is: Classical Vaisesika and the History of Indian Ontology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x7cLHPj1dj8C |year=1992|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-1178-0|pages=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; These newer manuscripts are quite different, more consistent with the historical literature, and suggests that, like other major texts and scriptures of Hinduism, ''Vaiśeṣika Sūtra'' too suffered interpolations, errors in transmission and distortion over time. A critical edition of the ''Vaiśeṣika Sūtra'' is now available.{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|pp=55-56}}

==Date==
The ''Vaisheshika Sutras'' mention the doctrines of competing schools of Indian philosophy such as Samkhya and Mimamsa,{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|p=54}} but make no mention of Buddhism, which has led scholars in more recent publications to posit estimates of 6th to 2nd century BCE.{{Sfn| Bart Labuschagne| Timo Slootweg|2012|p=60, Quote: "Kanada, a Hindu sage who lived either around the 6th or 2nd century BCE, and who founded the philosophical school of Vaisheshika.}}{{Sfn|Jeaneane D. Fowler|2002|pp=98-99}}{{Sfn|H. Margenau|2012|p=xxx-xxxi}}

The [[critical edition]] studies of ''Vaisheshika Sutras'' manuscripts discovered after 1950, suggest that the text attributed to Kanada existed in a finalized form sometime between 200 BCE and the start of the common era, with the possibility that its key doctrines are much older.{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|p=54}}{{Sfn|Jeaneane D. Fowler|2002|pp=98-99}} Multiple Hindu texts dated to the 1st and 2nd century CE, such as the ''Mahavibhasa'' and ''Jnanaprasthana'' from the [[Kushan Empire]], quote and comment on Kanada's doctrines.{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|p=55}} Although the ''Vaisheshika Sutras'' makes no mention of the doctrines of [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]], their ancient texts mention ''Vaisheshika Sutras'' doctrines and use its terminology,{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|p=55}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Bronkhorst|editor=Patrick Olivelle|title=Between the Empires: Society in India 300 BCE to 400 CE|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=efaOR_-YsIcC |year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-977507-1|pages=283–294}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly Buddhism's Sarvastivada tradition, as well as the works of [[Nagarjuna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Seyfort Ruegg|title=The Literature of the Madhyamaka School of Philosophy in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PSDDgB5ulIEC |year=1981|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-02204-0|pages=10, 50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physics and Philosophy==
Physics is central to Kaṇāda’s assertion that all that is knowable is based on motion. His ascribing centrality to physics in the understanding of the universe also follows from his invariance principles. For example, he says that the atom must be spherical since it should be the same in all dimensions. &lt;ref&gt;Kak, S. Kaṇāda, Great Physicist and Sage of Antiquity. https://medium.com/@subhashkak1/kaṇāda-the-great-physicist-and-sage-of-antiquity-5a2abd79b6f1]&lt;/ref&gt; He asserts that all substances are composed of atoms, two of which have mass and two are massless.

* There are nine constituents of realities: four classes of [[atoms]] (earth, water, light and air), space ([[akasha]]), time ([[Kāla (time)|kāla]]), direction (disha), infinity of souls ([[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]]), mind ([[Manas (early Buddhism)|manas]]).&lt;ref&gt;O'Flaherty, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Every object of creation is made of atoms (parmanu) which in turn connect with each other to form molecules (anu). Atoms are eternal, and their combinations constitute the empirical material world.
* Individual souls are eternal and pervade material body for a time.
* There are six categories ([[padārtha]]) of experience — substance, quality, activity, generality, particularity, and inherence.

Several traits of substances ([[dravya]]) are given as colour, taste, smell, touch, number, size, the separate, coupling and uncoupling, priority and posterity, comprehension, pleasure and pain, attraction and revulsion, and wishes.&lt;ref&gt;Vitsaxis, Vassilis.

The critical edition of the ''Vaisheshika Sutras'' are divided into ten chapters, each subdivided into two sections called āhnikas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M. Hiriyanna|title=The Essentials of Indian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QeRIP-TuKLAC |year=1995|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1330-4|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The later texts of the Vaisesika school expanded and revised some of these ideas, categories and theories, as did scholars of Jainism, Buddhism and other Hinduism schools.{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|pp=53-54}}}}
* In the first chapter, Kanada opens his Sutra with definitions of [[Dharma]], the importance of the [[Vedas]] and his goals. The text, states Matilal, then defines and describes three categories and their causal aspects: substance, quality and action.{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|p=56}} He explains their differences, similarities and relationships between these three. The second part of first chapter defines and explains a universal, a particular (''viśeṣa'',{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|p=53}}) and their hierarchical relationship. Kanada states that it is from combination of particulars that some universals emerge.{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|p=56}}
* The second chapter of the ''Vaisheshika Sutras'' presents five substances (earth, air, water, fire, space) each with a distinct quality. Kanada argues that all except "air and space" is verifiable by perception, while existence of invisible air is established by inference (air blows, and that there must be a substance that affects the touch sensation to the skin; space, he argues, is inferred from one's ability to move from one point to another unhindered - a point he revises in later part of the text by asserting that sound is perceived and proves space).{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|p=56}}
* In the third chapter, Kanada states his premises about [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (self, soul) and its validity. 
* In the fourth chapter discusses the body and its adjuncts.
[[File:The silver lining inside the forest.jpg|thumb|The Vaiśeṣika Sūtra mentions many empirical observations and natural phenomenon such as flow of fluids and motion of magnets, then attempts to explain them with naturalistic theories.{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|p=57}}]]
* In the fifth chapter action connected with the body and action connected with the mind are investigated. The text defines and discusses [[Yoga]] and [[Moksha]], asserting that self-knowledge (''atma-saksatkara'') is the means to spiritual liberation.{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|p=58}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/thevaiasesikasut00kanauoft#page/n11/mode/2up The Vaisesika Sutras of Kanada], page 3, Translated by Nandalal Sinha (note this translation is of the old disputed manuscript, not critical edition)&lt;/ref&gt; In this chapter, Kanada mentions various natural phenomena such as the falling of objects to ground, rising of fire upwards, the growth of grass upwards, the nature of rainfall and thunderstorms, the flow of liquids, the movement towards a magnet among many others; he then attempts to integrate his observations with his theories, and classifies phenomenon into two: those caused by volition, and those caused by subject-object conjunctions.{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|p=57}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/thevaiasesikasut00kanauoft#page/296/mode/2up The Vaisesika Sutras of Kanada], pagez 152-166, Translated by Nandalal Sinha (note this translation is of the old disputed manuscript, not critical edition)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Wells (2009), [http://darshanapress.com/The%20Vaisheshika%20Darshana.pdf The Vaisheshika Darshana], Darshana Press, Chapter 5 verses (main and appendix)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the sixth chapter puṇya (virtue) and pāpa (sin) are examined both as moral precepts and as discussed in the Vedas and Upanishads.{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|p=58}}
* In the seventh chapter discusses qualities such as color and taste as a function of heat, time, object and subject. Kanada dedicates a significant number of Sutras to his theory and importance of measurement.{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|p=58}}
* In the eighth chapter, Kanada dwells on nature of cognition and reality, arguing that cognition is a function of the object (substance) and subject. Some sutras are unclear, such as one on [[Artha]], which Kanada states is applicable only to "substance, quality and action" per his chapter one.{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|p=58}}
* In the ninth chapter, Kanada discusses [[epistemology]], particularly the nature of perception, inference and human reasoning process.{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|p=58}}
* In the final tenth chapter, the text focuses on soul, it attributes and threefold causes. Kanada asserts that human happiness and suffering is linked to ignorance, confusion and knowledge of the soul. He develops his theories of efficient cause, karma, body, mind, cognition and memory to present his thesis. He mentions meditation as a means of soul knowledge.{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|p=59}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/thevaiasesikasut00kanauoft#page/296/mode/2up The Vaisesika Sutras of Kanada], pagez 296-304, Translated by Nandalal Sinha (note this translation is of the old disputed manuscript, not critical edition)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Wells (2009), [http://darshanapress.com/The%20Vaisheshika%20Darshana.pdf The Vaisheshika Darshana], Darshana Press, pages 32-34&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1229">In [[many-body physics]], most commonly within [[condensed-matter physics]], a '''gapped Hamiltonian''' is a [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] for an infinitely large many-body system where there is a finite [[energy gap]] separating the (possibly degenerate) [[Ground state|ground space]] from the first [[Excited state|excited states]].  A Hamiltonian that is not gapped is called '''gapless'''.

The property of being gapped or gapless is formally defined through a sequence of Hamiltonians on finite [[Lattice model (physics)|lattices]] in the [[thermodynamic limit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/4930/what-does-it-mean-for-a-hamiltonian-or-system-to-be-gapped-or-gapless/29166|title=quantum mechanics - What does it mean for a Hamiltonian or system to be gapped or gapless?|website=Physics Stack Exchange|access-date=2019-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source|date=February 2019}}

An example is the [[BCS theory|BCS Hamiltonian]] in the theory of superconductivity.

In [[quantum field theory]], a continuum limit of many-body physics, a gapped Hamiltonian induces a [[mass gap]].
