<s> how are we doing </s> (s1)
<s> no no no by that i meant how are we homo sapiens we doing as a species </s> (s2)
<s> now the typical way to answer that question is this </s> (s3)
<s> you choose some measure of human physical well-being </s> (s4)
<s> average longevity average calories per day average income overall population that sort of thing </s> (s5)
<s> and draw a graph of its value over time </s> (s6)
<s> in almost every case you get the same result </s> (s7)
<s> the line skitters along at a low level for millennia then rockets up exponentially in the 19th and 20th century </s> (s8)
<s> or choose a measure of consumption </s> (s9)
<s> consumption of energy consumption of fresh water consumption of the world's photosynthesis </s> (s10)
<s> and draw a graph of its value over time </s> (s11)

<s> biologists have a word for this outbreak </s> (s2-1)
<s> an outbreak is when a population or species exceeds the bounds of natural selection </s> (s2-2)
<s> natural selection ordinarily keeps populations and species within roughly defined limits </s> (s2-3)
<s> pests parasites lack of resources prevent them from expanding too much </s> (s2-4)
<s> but every now and then a species escapes its bounds </s> (s2-5)
<s> crown-of-thorns starfish in the indian ocean zebra mussels in the great lakes spruce budworm here in canada </s> (s2-6)
<s> populations explode a hundredfold a thousandfold a millionfold </s> (s2-7)
<s> so here's a fundamental lesson from biology outbreaks in nature don't end well </s> (s2-8)
<s> put a couple of protozoa into a petri dish full of nutrient goo </s> (s21)
<s> in their natural habitat soil or water </s> (s22)
<s> their environment constrains them </s> (s23)
<s> in the petri dish they have an ocean of breakfast and no natural enemies </s> (s24)
<s> they eat and reproduce eat and reproduce eat and reproduce until bang </s> (s25)
<s> they hit the edge of the petri dish at which point they either drown in their own waste starve from lack of resources or both </s> (s26)
<s> the outbreak ends always badly </s> (s27)
<s> now from the viewpoint of biology you and i are not fundamentally different than the protozoa in the petri dish </s> (s28)
<s> we're not special </s> (s29)
<s> all the things that we in our vanity think make us different </s> (s30)
<s> art science technology and so forth </s> (s31)
<s> they don't matter </s> (s32)
<s> we're an outbreak species </s> (s33)
<s> we're going to hit the edge of the petri dish simple as that </s> (s34)
<s> well the obvious question is this actually true </s> (s35)
<s> are we in fact doomed to hit the edge of the petri dish </s> (s36)
<s> i'd like to set aside this question for a moment and ask you guys another one </s> (s37)
<s> if we are going to escape biology how are we going to do it </s> (s38)
<s> in the year 2050 there will be almost 10 billion people in the world and all of those people will want the things that you and i want </s> (s39)
<s> nice cars nice clothes nice homes the odd chunk of toblerone </s> (s40)
<s> i mean think of it toblerone for 10 billion people how are we going to do this </s> (s41)
<s> how are we going to feed everybody get water to everybody provide power to everybody avoid the worst impacts of climate change </s> (s42)
<s> i'm a science journalist and i've been asking these questions to researchers for years </s> (s43)
<s> and in my experience their answers fall into two broad categories which i call wizards and prophets </s> (s44)
<s> wizards techno whizzes believe that science and technology properly applied will let us produce our way out of our dilemmas </s> (s45)
<s> be smart make more they say that way everyone can win </s> (s46)
<s> prophets believe close to the opposite </s> (s47)
<s> they see the world as governed by fundamental ecological processes with limits that we transgress to our peril </s> (s48)
<s> use less conserve they say </s> (s49)
<s> otherwise everybody is going to lose </s> (s50)
