how are we doing 
no no no by that i meant how are we homo sapiens we doing as a species 
now the typical way to answer that question is this
you choose some measure of human physical well-being
average longevity average calories per day average income overall population that sort of thing
and draw a graph of its value over time
in almost every case you get the same result
the line skitters along at a low level for millennia then rockets up exponentially in the 19th and 20th century
or choose a measure of consumption
consumption of energy consumption of fresh water consumption of the world's photosynthesis
and draw a graph of its value over time
in the same way the line skitters along at a low level for millennia then rockets up exponentially in the 19th and 20th century
biologists have a word for this outbreak
an outbreak is when a population or species exceeds the bounds of natural selection
natural selection ordinarily keeps populations and species within roughly defined limits
pests parasites lack of resources prevent them from expanding too much
but every now and then a species escapes its bounds
crown-of-thorns starfish in the indian ocean zebra mussels in the great lakes spruce budworm here in canada 
populations explode a hundredfold a thousandfold a millionfold
so heres a fundamental lesson from biology outbreaks in nature don't end well
put a couple of protozoa into a petri dish full of nutrient goo
in their natural habitat soil or water
their environment constrains them 
in the petri dish they have an ocean of breakfast and no natural enemies
they eat and reproduce eat and reproduce eat and reproduce until bang
they hit the edge of the petri dish at which point they either drown in their own waste starve from lack of resources or both
the outbreak ends always badly
now from the viewpoint of biology you and i are not fundamentally different than the protozoa in the petri dish
we're not special
all the things that we in our vanity think make us different
art science technology and so forth
they don't matter 
we're an outbreak species
we're going to hit the edge of the petri dish simple as that
well the obvious question is this actually true
are we in fact doomed to hit the edge of the petri dish
i'd like to set aside this question for a moment and ask you guys another one
if we are going to escape biology how are we going to do it
in the year 2050 there will be almost 10 billion people in the world and all of those people will want the things that you and i want
nice cars nice clothes nice homes the odd chunk of toblerone
i mean think of it toblerone for 10 billion people how are we going to do this
how are we going to feed everybody get water to everybody provide power to everybody avoid the worst impacts of climate change
i'm a science journalist and i've been asking these questions to researchers for years
and in my experience their answers fall into two broad categories which i call wizards and prophets
wizards techno whizzes believe that science and technology properly applied will let us produce our way out of our dilemmas
be smart make more they say that way everyone can win
prophets believe close to the opposite
they see the world as governed by fundamental ecological processes with limits that we transgress to our peril
use less conserve they say
otherwise everybody is going to lose
