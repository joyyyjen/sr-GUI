<s> how are we doing </s> (s1)
<s> no no no by that i meant how are we homo sapiens we doing as a species </s> (s2)
<s> now the typical way to answer that question is this </s> (s3)
<s> you choose some measure of human physical well-being </s> (s4)
<s> average longevity average calories per day average income overall population that sort of thing </s> (s5)
<s> and draw a graph of its value over time </s> (s6)
<s> in almost every case you get the same result </s> (s7)
<s> the line skitters along at a low level for millennia then rockets up exponentially in the 19th and 20th century </s> (s8)
<s> or choose a measure of consumption </s> (s9)
<s> consumption of energy consumption of fresh water consumption of the world's photosynthesis </s> (s10)

<s> biologists have a word for this outbreak </s> (s2-1)
<s> an outbreak is when a population or species exceeds the bounds of natural selection </s> (s2-2)
<s> natural selection ordinarily keeps populations and species within roughly defined limits </s> (s2-3)
<s> pests parasites lack of resources prevent them from expanding too much </s> (s2-4)
<s> but every now and then a species escapes its bounds </s> (s2-5)
<s> crown-of-thorns starfish in the indian ocean zebra mussels in the great lakes spruce budworm here in canada </s> (s2-6)
<s> populations explode a hundredfold a thousandfold a millionfold </s> (s2-7)
<s> so here's a fundamental lesson from biology outbreaks in nature don't end well </s> (s2-8)
<s> put a couple of protozoa into a petri dish full of nutrient goo </s> (s21)
<s> in their natural habitat soil or water </s> (s22)
<s> their environment constrains them </s> (s23)
<s> in the petri dish they have an ocean of breakfast and no natural enemies </s> (s24)
<s> they eat and reproduce eat and reproduce eat and reproduce until bang </s> (s25)
<s> they hit the edge of the petri dish at which point they either drown in their own waste starve from lack of resources or both </s> (s26)
<s> the outbreak ends always badly </s> (s27)
<s> now from the viewpoint of biology you and i are not fundamentally different than the protozoa in the petri dish </s> (s28)
<s> we're not special </s> (s29)
<s> all the things that we in our vanity think make us different </s> (s30)
<s> art science technology and so forth </s> (s31)
<s> they don't matter </s> (s32)
<s> we're an outbreak species </s> (s33)
<s> we're going to hit the edge of the petri dish simple as that </s> (s34)
<s> well the obvious question is this actually true </s> (s35)
<s> are we in fact doomed to hit the edge of the petri dish </s> (s36)
<s> i'd like to set aside this question for a moment and ask you guys another one </s> (s37)
<s> if we are going to escape biology how are we going to do it </s> (s38)
<s> in the year 2050 there will be almost 10 billion people in the world and all of those people will want the things that you and i want </s> (s39)
<s> nice cars nice clothes nice homes the odd chunk of toblerone </s> (s40)
<s> i mean think of it toblerone for 10 billion people how are we going to do this </s> (s41)
<s> how are we going to feed everybody get water to everybody provide power to everybody avoid the worst impacts of climate change </s> (s42)
<s> i'm a science journalist and i've been asking these questions to researchers for years </s> (s43)
<s> and in my experience their answers fall into two broad categories which i call wizards and prophets </s> (s44)
<s> wizards techno whizzes believe that science and technology properly applied will let us produce our way out of our dilemmas </s> (s45)
<s> be smart make more they say that way everyone can win </s> (s46)
<s> prophets believe close to the opposite </s> (s47)
<s> they see the world as governed by fundamental ecological processes with limits that we transgress to our peril </s> (s48)
<s> use less conserve they say </s> (s49)
<s> otherwise everybody is going to lose </s> (s50)
<s> we are kicking off this evening a week-long celebration of a landmark event which is the golden anniversary of the allerton conference on communication control and computing </s> (1)
<s> for those of you who have been regular attendees at the allerton conference for many years and for some probably allerton is special place in your career having presented your first paper or second paper in your career at the allerton conference and i know that there are many of you out there </s> (2)
<s> for those of you for whom this is the very first allerton conference an-and for all conference attendees and for our guests this is a historic moment </s> (3)
<s> it's a celebration of a multi-disciplinary scientific meeting which was launched 50 years ago on november 15 1963 with vision and incredible foresight </s> (4)
<s> it was the brainchild of mac van valkenburg who together with joe cruz co-chaired the first conference 50 years ago </s> (5)
<s> bill perkins eh who is here ehht and eh he was also involved in the initial discussions and planning of the conference and i believe he is the only one in this room who has witnessed that historic event 50 years ago </s> (6)
<s> the creatives' vision was as articulated by mac and joe in the forward to the proceedings of that first conference </s> (7)
<s> that vision was to provide an opportunity for researchers to present their fresh new results in a dynamic growing field and to bring researchers in different disciplines together to cultivate cross-fertilization of ideas </s> (8)
<s> and this was right on target </s> (9)
<s> and this far-reaching vision of its founders is still the guiding light at allerton 50 years later </s> (10)
<s> it's-it's one of the longest running conferences at least that i'm aware of in the systems area and it's one of the most prestigious </s> (11)
<s> it's perhaps the only longest running conference that has never changed its venue </s> (12)
<s> from the very beginning it has been held at the allerton house in monticello illinois </s> (13)
<s> only a minor adjustment was made in going from the first to the second allerton conference in 1964 which was to move the date from the chilly mid november to late september which was september 28th through the 30th </s> (14)
<s> that's when the-the second allerton conference was held so that the attendees can enjoy the beautiful fall weather at the allerton grounds and it looks like at least some of the days we'll have that beautiful weather with us this year also </s> (15)
<s> i'm told eh i'm not sure to what extent that it is a fact but eh mac actually wanted to hold the first eh conference in october the first week in october because that coincided would have coincided with his birth date which was october 5th </s> (16)
<s> but the allerton house was not available at the time and i'm told that was the reason why it was pushed to november the 15th </s> (17)
<s> but then immediately the following year it was brought back to the first week or the last week in september and since then it has always been held either the last week in september or the first week in october </s> (18)
