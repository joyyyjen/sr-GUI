we are cutting off this the running and a week long celebration often landmark events that led to the golden anniversary of the ballot in conference on conditions on the london to
for those of you who have been regular attendees at ballot and conference for many years and for some probably alex and it is special place in your career hitting presented your first paper or second paper in your career at the ballot and confidence and i know that there are many of you out the there
for those of a formal notice of the very first alexander on for months and then fall conference attendees and far as this is a historic moment
it's a celebration of that lol the discipline and scientific meeting which was launched fifty years ago on november fifteen nineteen six thirty with vision an incredible force
it was the brainchild of madmen all embarked ought to get the job for us courts here at the first conference the fifty years ago
milk cartons that glorious here than it does it and that he was also involved in the initial discussions and letting go of the conference and i believe he is the lawn lawn in this room or as a witness that these are active and fifty years ago
that creates us vision loss is that the goliath of magma a mac and jaw in the fourth of the proceedings of that first conference the
that vision was a couple lived an opportunity for researchers to present their first beer results in a dynamic gnawing feel and to link researchers in different disciplines the kid there to cultivate cause for the position of our ideas
and this was right on target
and thus far reaching vision off its fonda is is the limit in black and salads and fifty years like that
it's it's one of the longest running conferences at least that i'm unaware of in this isn't an app and it's one of the most of these years but
it's perhaps the only the longest running conference that has never changed its venue
from the very beginning it it has been held at the allison house in monticello illinois
only a minor adjustment was a big been going from the first of the second ballot and confidence in ninety six of warp which cost of more than they are from that still live in november the late september or which was set them up front is a deserted
that's one that the second paladin conference will sell so that the attendees can enjoy the beautiful fall under the alex and arms and it looks lack the play some of the visible at that beautiful the wooden with us this year also
an assault that i'm not sure the locks the extent that says is that fact but the mac actually want to double the first day conference in all over the first week in october and because that was the book that coincided with is that it which was a little more than fifty
but the allison awful that available at the plant and that's all that was the reason why it was forced to november the city
but then immediately the following year it was brought back to the first week or the last week in september and since then it has always been held either the last week in september or the first week in october
