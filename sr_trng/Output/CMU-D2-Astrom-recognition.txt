we are taking off this they remained a week long celebration often landmark events which is the golden anniversary of the ballot in conference on communication controlling computing
for those of you who have being a regular attendees at balancing conference for many years and for some probably a pallet than this special place in new york area and then being presented your first date or or second bigger bigger barrier at balancing office and i know that there are many of you out there
for those of two phone this is the very first ballot in conference and then fall conference attendees and fog as this is a historic moment
it's a celebration of that malt the disciplinary a scientific meeting which was launched fifty years ago on november fifth a ninety six is a with vision an incredible force ah
it was the brainchild of mecca unwelcome work boat together with jokes those quotes share the first conference fifty years ago
bill parkinson's that glorious year mandate that and the new was also involved in the initial discussions and letting go of the golf pros and i believe he is though only won in this room who has witnessed that these are given fifty years ago
that creates as vision was bizarre to go like that meant my mac and join in the forward to the proceedings of that first conference
that's a vision was to vote like no fortunate to for researchers to present their first few results in a dynamic going to feel and fumbling we start trusting different disciplines together to cultivate coast fertilization of ideas
and this goes i don't target
and thus far reaching vision off its ponders is still the guiding light at the eller than fifty years like that
it's it's one of the longest one eight conferences that plays that kind of wear off in this isn't very out and it's one of the most is the idiots that
it's perhaps still only eight longest running conference that has never changed it's me and
from the very beginning it has been out alex and lost him on the cello illinois
only a minor adjustment was made it's been going from the first of the second ballot and confidence in ninety six civil war which was to motivate from that show where mid november so late september which was set them with ten days but the third year
that's one that the second ballot and how things worse now so that then then these can enjoy the beautiful full were there at the house and grounds and it looks like it's way some of the base will have that beautiful weather with us this year also
i'm salt bad i'm not sure so what's the extent that says is that fact but then mac actually want it to all the first day conference in all your route the first week in october because that coincided with that coincided with his birthday which little over the fifth
but that out an awful about the veil that that time and i'm told that was the reason why it was pushed the november than fifty
but then immediately the following year it was brought back to the first week for the last week in september and since then it has always been out either the last week and i'm both the first week in october
