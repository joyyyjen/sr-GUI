1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:06,005
We are kicking off this evening

2
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:10,210
a week-long celebration
of a landmark event,

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,878
which is the golden anniversary

4
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:15,815
of the Allerton Conference on Communication, Control,

5
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:17,784
and Computing.

6
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:21,187
For those of you who have
been regular attendees

7
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:24,124
at the Allerton Conference
for many years

8
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:29,162
and for some probably Allerton is special place

9
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:30,797
in your career,

10
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:33,032
having presented
your first paper

11
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:36,736
or second paper in your career at the Allerton Conference,

12
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:40,740
and I know that there are
many of you out there.

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,744
For those of you for whom this
is the very first

14
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:46,880
Allerton Conference,

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,151
an-and for all conference attendees and for our guests,

16
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,920
this is a historic moment.

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,988
It's a celebration

18
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:59,092
of a multi-disciplinary scientific meeting

19
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:06,065
which was launched 50 years ago on November 15, 1963

20
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:11,438
with vision and
incredible foresight.

21
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:15,341
It was the brainchild
of Mac Van Valkenburg

22
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:17,944
who, together with Joe Cruz,

23
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:23,183
co-chaired the first conference 50 years ago.

24
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:26,519
Bill Perkins, eh, who is here,

25
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:29,189
ehht, and, eh,

26
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,959
he was also involved
in the initial discussions

27
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,161
and planning of the conference,

28
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:39,432
and I believe he is the only one in this room

29
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:43,436
who has witnessed that historic event 50 years ago.

30
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:48,875
The creatives' vision was,

31
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:53,646
as articulated by Mac and Joe in the forward to the proceedings

32
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:56,483
of that first conference.

33
00:01:56,483 --> 00:02:01,521
That vision was to provide an
opportunity for researchers

34
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,556
to present their fresh new results

35
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:06,392
in a dynamic growing field

36
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:10,663
and to bring researchers in
different disciplines together

37
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:14,901
to cultivate cross-fertilization of ideas.

38
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:18,037
And this was right on target.

39
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:19,906
And this far-reaching vision

40
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:23,877
of its founders is still
the guiding light

41
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:27,814
at Allerton 50 years later.

42
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:32,519
It's-it's one of the longest running conferences

43
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:36,923
at least that I'm aware
of in the systems area,

44
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:39,125
and it's one
of the most prestigious.

45
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:44,197
It's perhaps the only longest
running conference

46
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,399
that has never changed
its venue.

47
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:52,405
From the very beginning, it has been held at the Allerton House

48
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,607
in Monticello, Illinois.

49
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:58,578
Only a minor adjustment was made

50
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:01,814
in going from the first to the second Allerton Conference

51
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,983
in 1964,

52
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:09,856
which was to move the date from the chilly mid November

53
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:14,627
to late September, which was September 28th through the 30th.

54
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:18,665
That's when the-the second Allerton Conference was held,

55
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:22,302
so that the attendees can enjoy the beautiful fall weather

56
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,604
at the Allerton grounds,

57
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,574
and it looks like,
at least some of the days

58
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:32,645
we'll have that beautiful weather with us this year also.

59
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:38,284
I'm told, eh, I'm not sure to what extent that it is a fact,

60
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:46,225
but, eh, Mac actually wanted to hold the first, eh, conference

61
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:49,629
in October,
the first week in October

62
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:52,899
because that coincided,
would have coincided

63
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:58,037
with his birth date,
which was October 5th.

64
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:01,374
But the Allerton House was not
available at the time,

65
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:03,443
and I'm told
that was the reason why

66
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,913
it was pushed to
November the 15th.

67
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,749
But then immediately
the following year,

68
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,986
it was brought back
to the first week

69
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,420
or the last week in September,

70
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,423
and since then
it has always been held

71
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,992
either the last week
in September

72
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,426
or the first week in October.

73
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:24,864
The conference has evolved
over the years

74
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:28,468
in parallel to the developments in the fields of communication,

75
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:29,769
control, and computing,

76
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:38,211
and in fact it has at times influenced, impacted, and shaped

77
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,580
the evolutions in those fields.

78
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,383
Some of the very early results,

79
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:46,486
which then became landmarks
in these fields,

80
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:49,856
were presented
at the Allerton Conference.

81
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:52,191
To share with you some numbers,

82
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:56,562
in 1963,
at the very first conference

83
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:59,699
there were
11 technical sessions,

84
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,436
3 general or what we now call plenary sessions,

85
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,438
they were not called
that way at the time,

86
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:13,312
with 62 individual presentations involving 84 authors.

87
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:16,249
The proceedings of that
inaugural meeting

88
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:23,122
was edited by Joe Cruz,
and it comprised 780 pages.

89
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:28,194
And here I have actually a copy of that very first proceedings

90
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:31,798
and it is in such good shape,
50 years later.

91
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:32,799
[laughing]

92
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,568
And the, and the proceedings in the intervening years

93
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,503
have always looked like this.

94
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,038
Nothing has changed.

95
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:45,344
And the, eh, today, as compared with those initial numbers,

96
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:47,513
49 years later,

97
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:51,617
we have in the program
this week, 65 sessions,

98
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:55,321
344 individual presentations,

99
00:05:55,321 --> 00:06:00,927
and have almost 500 authors, maybe even over 500 authors,

100
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:04,397
are involved in these papers which will be presented here.

101
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:07,300
So it's a, it's a major growth,

102
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,104
but we are limited by the size of the Allerton House,

103
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,873
so don't expect
those numbers to grow,

104
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:17,710
to double within the next even, uh, 10 years.

105
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:22,548
So talking about
the celebrations,

106
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,818
this, eh, golden anniversary of the Allerton Conference

107
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:30,990
is not the only important anniversary on our campus today.

108
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,128
Today is also the exact,
to the day,

109
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:38,998
first year anniversary of our chancellor, Phyllis Wise,

110
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:42,935
taking on the stewardship
of our campus.

111
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:47,273
We are delighted and honored
to have her here with us

112
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:51,144
this evening to share with us this important moment

113
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,346
and to officially open
this kick-off event

114
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,648
for the golden anniversary.

115
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:58,151
Chancellor Wise also holds
the position

116
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,386
of Vice President
of the University of Illinois,

117
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:03,422
and as CEO of our campus

118
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:06,592
she is responsible for all financial programs,

119
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:11,197
campus policies, and priorities with the mission of insuring

120
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:14,233
a transformative,
educational experience

121
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:17,837
for America's next generation
of leaders.

122
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:21,841
She has held, eh, faculty and
administrative appointments

123
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,910
at the University of Washington,

124
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,412
at the University
of California at Davis

125
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:31,017
and Kentucky, eh, prior to joining here, eh, Illinois.

126
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,519
Eh, her research career

127
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,756
has focused on issues
concerning women's health

128
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,224
and gender based biology.

129
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:41,093
She is a Fellow of AAAS

130
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:44,197
and a member of the
National Academy of Sciences

131
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,065
Institute of Medicine.

132
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:48,100
Please join me in welcoming

133
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,269
Vice President and Chancellor, Phyllis Wise,

134
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:56,275
to the podium, to open
this golden anniversary.

135
00:07:56,275 --> 00:08:02,949
[applause]

136
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,217
(Phyllis Wise)
Somebody took good care

137
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:07,353
of these proceedings
from 50 years ago.

138
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:10,923
It's a real honor to be here
in this overflowing room.

139
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:13,292
I wonder whether
we're in fire code,

140
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:14,427
but that's, that's okay.

141
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,429
I won't say anything,
if you don't.

142
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:19,632
Um, it is truly an honor
to be here

143
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:24,637
to, uh, welcome you to
the 50th anniversary celebration

144
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:27,306
of this wonderful conference with such a long

145
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:28,975
and strong history.

146
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,377
Y'know, um,
when I got this position

147
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:34,647
I tried really hard to, uh,
do a lot of homework

148
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:35,815
on the University of Illinois

149
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:38,317
to learn about
my new academic home,

150
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:41,320
and I must admit I did not come across the Allerton Conference

151
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,824
so I must not have done
homework enough to realize

152
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:48,995
what a rich tradition was really started 50 years ago.

153
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:52,164
Um, this conference
really is an illustration of,

154
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,967
uh, what can happen
at a great university

155
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,670
with a 145 year history.

156
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:02,608
Uh, the-the story that you just told, Professor Baser-Basar,

157
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:06,279
and, uh, what I'm learning tonight about all of this,

158
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,147
is truly amazing.

159
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,750
I think it's wonderful that it
started out at Allerton

160
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,752
and it continues
to be at Allerton.

161
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,086
I think it's wonderful to know

162
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,822
that sometimes traditions
should be carried on

163
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:20,126
because they hav-are part of
the richness of the experience.

164
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:25,264
Um, you know, I-I just want to add tonight that, uh,

165
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:29,101
I'm sure that this is the beginning of the next 50 years

166
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,102
of this conference,

167
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:33,606
and though it won't get larger in terms of number,

168
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,608
that that is actually
a good thing

169
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:38,711
because sometimes the intimacy that you gather from having

170
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,279
only a few hundred people

171
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,748
cannot be replicated
when you let it grow

172
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,384
into thousands and thousands
of people at the same time.

173
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,954
So I wish you the very
best in this conference.

174
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,623
I am honored to be here to
welcome you to it

175
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:54,026
and I wish you the richest of ca-discussions

176
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:58,431
and, and, um, new discoveries being discussed here.

177
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,566
Thank you very
much for having me.

178
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:09,208
[clapping]

179
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:18,184
(male)
Now that we have

180
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:22,254
the official opening of the confernece, Allerton Conference

181
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:25,725
we can, uh, eh,
continue with the program,

182
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:32,164
and, eh, and we have a very distinguished, eh, eh, speaker,

183
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:38,637
eh, to, uh, eh, for this, eh, kick-off evening,

184
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:41,007
and-and this is
something special.

185
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,141
Allerton Conference,

186
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,944
for those of you who have attended in the past,

187
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,946
has always been for three days

188
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:50,516
and all events were held
out in Monticello,

189
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:53,252
and because of this
50th anniversary

190
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:59,058
we decided to, eh, have
a kick-off event here on campus

191
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:03,262
and so that we can attract, uh, people who maybe normally

192
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,931
would not have
gone out to Allerton.

193
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:10,836
And, eh, and, and we wanted to pick someone, uh,

194
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:16,909
who is, uh, who will talk to the importance of this occasion.

195
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:23,582
And, eh, I'm very pleased, eh, eh, to, eh, have, eh,

196
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:27,787
Karl Astrom from
Lund University of Sweden,

197
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,122
eh, to be the keynote speaker

198
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:33,793
or the Jubilee Lecturer
this evening.

199
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:38,531
Eh, he is a world renown control
scientist and engineer

200
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,266
and educator,

201
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,668
and I can take
a full hour, actually,

202
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,937
to talk about his accomplishments,

203
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:46,672
his impact on the field,

204
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:50,109
not only on the control field but-but-but across the board

205
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:55,047
and, eh, eh, communications, eh, and-and computing,

206
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,717
those that-that are really
the topics

207
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,853
and areas that are covered Aller-at

208
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,521
the Allerton Conference.

209
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:07,426
So let me say just a-a few brief, eh, words on, uh,

210
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:10,529
Karl's background and-and
some of his achievements.

211
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:13,265
As I said, I won't be
able to cover everything.

212
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:14,834
He was educated at

213
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:18,170
the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.

214
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:21,607
During his studies, he worked on
inertial navigation

215
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:25,377
for Research Institute
of National Defense.

216
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:28,848
After working for IBM research
for five years,

217
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:33,285
he was appointed Professor of the Chair of Automatic Control

218
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:37,590
at Lund Institute of Technology, or Lund University,

219
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,658
where he established
a new department.

220
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:44,130
From 2000 'til 2010
he was a professor

221
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,566
at the University of California in Santa Barbara,

222
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:50,569
and he is currently back at
Lund University

223
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:52,705
as a, as a senior professor.

224
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:56,509
Uh, he has broad interest in control including,

225
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:00,179
stochastic control, modeling, system identification,

226
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,181
adaptive control,
computer control,

227
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,650
and computer-aided
control engineering.

228
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:09,889
He is listed in the ISI,
ISA Highly Cited

229
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,858
and-and he has
the Adarsh number three.

230
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:16,228
For those of you who don't
know what that means,

231
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:20,166
ask your neighbor,
but after the lecture.

232
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,768
And, uh, two,
he has seven books,

233
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:24,737
and two of these books

234
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:28,674
have received the prestigious Harold Chestnut Textbook Prize

235
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:32,178
from the International Federation of Automatic Control.

236
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:36,382
And one of his papers on
self-tuning control,

237
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:39,585
which is very well known,
very well cited,

238
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:42,254
which was co-authored
with Wittenmark,

239
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,690
eh, again from Lund University,

240
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:49,195
was selected for the IEEE book on control theory.

241
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:52,865
This was the millennium, eh, book on Control Theory,

242
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,201
25 Seminal Papers,

243
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:59,338
eh, covering the period
1932 and 1981.

244
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:06,145
There were only 25 papers that
were picked, eh, er-eh, out of,

245
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:08,314
from a pool of thousands
of papers,

246
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,482
and-and this was one of those.

247
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:12,318
Eh, he has several patents,

248
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:15,654
and one of them for automatic tuning of PID controllers,

249
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:19,325
which he holds jointly
with-with Hagglund,

250
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,826
eh, and that has led

251
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:24,129
to substantial
industrial production.

252
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:26,765
Eh, Karl is a member

276
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,518
and, uh, please join me
in welcoming Karl

277
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,620
to deliver the Jubilee Lecture.

278
00:15:54,620 --> 00:16:03,095
[applause]

279
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:11,403
(Karl)
Thank you very much, Tamer.

280
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:14,306
I should also tell the students,
sitting there in the back,

281
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,974
there are a couple
of seats up front.

282
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:19,244
Don't be shy, but step forward
and use these seats, please.

283
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:22,681
Um, it's certainly a great honor for me to speak

284
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,683
on this fantastic location

285
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,719
of the celebration
of the Allerton Conference.

286
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,721
So, I would like to
thank you very much

287
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,856
for inviting me to do this.

288
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:35,194
And, em, Tamer asked me to give a broad picture of control,

289
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,663
and I was brave enough
to take this picture.

290
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,865
There should actually be
a sub-line here saying,

291
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,500
"a personal reflection."

292
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,470
So remember what I'm saying here are my personal views.

293
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,572
They're certainly
not universal truth.

294
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:52,845
So, eh, control has been around for a long time,

295
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:57,082
but it really started to grow in connection with the development

296
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,083
of the industries.

297
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,653
Eh, it was sometimes
an enabling technology,

298
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:05,824
but one didn't recognize that there were lots of similarities

299
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:08,927
between for example, process control, telecommunications,

300
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:10,896
flight control, etc.

301
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:14,466
And it became an engineering discipline in the 1940s,

302
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:18,570
eh, and it has been developing very, very rapidly.

303
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:22,674
And today we have lots
and lots of applications

304
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:25,010
and also some
very interesting challenges.

305
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:30,482
Eh, there have recently been a
couple of studies

306
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:31,884
of broad pictures of control.

307
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,920
For example, the IEEE
Control Systems Society

308
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,956
has published a book called The Impact of Control Technology,

309
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,691
which is available on the web,

310
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:42,895
and in connection with
the year eh-two, eh-2000

311
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,897
there were a couple
of books presented

312
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,699
that gave a perspective of engineering and control,

313
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:49,334
uh, in this century,

314
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,170
and I listed a few of them there

315
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,337
and we'll come back
to them later.

316
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:55,474
One thing,

317
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:58,410
that has been a hallmark
of the control community

318
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,446
is a solid foundation.

319
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:03,749
And I've always been wanting to
have an illustration of this

320
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:07,920
and by accident I found this
in Montreal this summer.

321
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,888
This beautiful building here

322
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:12,591
happens to be an insurance building in Montreal.

323
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,193
And you look at this beaut,

324
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:17,529
it was one of the most beautiful buildings in Montreal.

325
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:20,799
But this tower fell down

326
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,902
because the foundations
were not so good.

327
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:26,271
They had put in wooden pillars
in the ground

328
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,273
and then they started to rot.

329
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,343
So, what I'm saying here, even
if you have a beautiful house,

330
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:34,279
unless the foundations
are solid,

331
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,314
eh, it's gonna tumble down.

332
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,115
So I'm very proud to say

333
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:39,117
that this has been
a hallmark of control

334
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:41,887
and you will see this logo popping up here and there.

335
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:46,825
I've called control
the hidden technology.

336
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,994
Eh, it's widely used,

337
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:50,195
it's very successful,

338
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:51,330
it's seldom talked about

339
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,332
except when there's a disaster, you know.

340
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:56,835
When a reactor blows up,
when the airplane crashes.

341
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,837
And I've often
been wondering why.

342
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:02,608
And I think it's much easier to
talk about devices than ideas.

343
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:05,711
It's much easier to say,
will a computer fix that

344
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:08,547
than the ideas
that are behind it.

345
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:09,548
And also I think

346
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,884
we have something to blame ourselves for.

347
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,419
We have been very bad at
telling what control is

348
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,288
to our fellow scientists

349
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:21,460
and also, em, to our colleagues and to the general public.

350
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,630
Eh, so therefore,
I have advised our students,

351
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,965
this is something
that we have done badly

352
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:29,801
and you in the next generation now have to do it.

353
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,837
So I think Intel
did it very well

354
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,805
with this sort of Intel inside, y'know.

355
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:35,974
So we should have something
like Control inside.

356
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:37,476
So that would be one symbol.

357
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,144
And then we should remember, y'know,

358
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:41,480
to keep the foundations okay.

359
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,316
And if we do this, things would
be very well here in the future.

360
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:46,885
So what will I do now?

361
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,420
Well I have a very
simple outline.

362
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,322
I-its exactly follows the title.

363
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,858
The past, the present,
the future,

364
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,860
and then I will do
a little summary.

365
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,061
So now let's do the past.

366
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,164
Eh, control is a young field.

367
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:02,768
Ehm, it's a little bit older than the Allerton Conference.

368
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:08,473
Eh, and-em, eh, so it's useful
to think about this.

369
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:09,641
We are not matured, y'know.

370
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:14,012
We're a little bit more
than teenagers but barely.

371
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,648
Eh, there's been e-early use
of control in many fields.

372
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:19,351
In governors for machines,
in process controls,

373
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,653
in vehicle control,
and communication.

374
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:24,556
As I said before, people didn't
realize it was the same thing

375
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:30,162
until we got the Servomechanism
Theory around, say, 1940, 1950.

376
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,631
And this had
tremendous consequences.

377
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,967
Education on control spread
like wildfire

378
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,536
in all engineering education

379
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:40,505
and I think everybody would have been proud a-uh, about this.

380
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:42,741
But around 1960, y'know,

381
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,977
about the time the Allerton Conference started,

382
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,512
there was a paradigm shift.

383
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:50,082
And we got to tackle
the second phase in control

384
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,883
that I will talk a lot about.

385
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:53,885
And I think what we're
experience now

386
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:55,053
is the third phase.

387
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:56,555
And I'm not so sure about this

388
00:20:56,555 --> 00:21:00,359
so that's why I put
a question mark over there.

389
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,493
So let's now do something.

390
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,562
Let's look at power generation.

391
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,931
Y'know, you start to
generate electric power

392
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,733
and if you were using AC

393
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,702
you wanted to generate it
with constant frequency.

394
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:11,703
The solution to this

395
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:13,705
was that you introduced a turbine controller

396
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:17,075
which is a classic watt
governor that was, eh,

397
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:19,077
y'know, these two wheels
start spinning around.

398
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:21,413
If they go-go, eh, if go fast,

399
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:24,116
you-you, eh, reduce
the amount of water

400
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,685
that's coming in, etc.

401
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:31,490
The side effect of this is that whenever you use feedback,

402
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,358
you run the risk of instability.

403
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,861
And that happened when people
started to experiment with this,

404
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:37,696
so you need it to have
stability theory.

405
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:39,031
And there were
a number of people,

406
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,600
that you can see
in the bottom of the slide

407
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,601
who contributed to this.

408
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:45,504
There you see from-from left to right you see Maxwell,

409
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,506
who actually wrote one
of the early papers

410
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:48,674
of analysis of control systems,

411
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:51,009
Routh, a British mathematician,

412
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,345
Stodola, a Swiss
turbine engineer,

413
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:56,415
Hurwitz, a sw-a Swiss mathematician,

414
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:59,851
Vyshnegradski, a Russian engineer, and Lyapunov.

415
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:02,287
So there was a whole lo-eh-slough of people

416
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:04,322
who were developing
stability theory.

417
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:09,261
Let's move to another
field, process control.

418
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:12,364
Typical problem was a chemical
process to keep temperatures,

419
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:14,800
to keep pressures,
etc. constant.

420
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,802
The solution to this
was the PID controller.

421
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:19,438
There were some
nice side effects.

422
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:22,340
We got an industrial
communication standard,

423
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,610
consisting of plastic tubes
of given dimensions

424
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,813
and the agreement that you should propagate signals

425
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:31,383
by pressures between
3 and 15 psi.

426
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,385
And then you had
standard instruments

427
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,387
and standard devices
that you connected.

428
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,956
Course with the day's
communication standard, eh,

429
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:39,958
it's not too good
and not too fast,

430
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,793
but at least it was a standard.

431
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:44,930
We also got two new rules
to tune the PID controllers.

432
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:48,366
Flight Control.

433
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,268
Question is how to fly?

434
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:53,905
And one reason that the Wright
Brothers succeeded

435
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:56,875
was that they
understood dynamics.

436
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,845
And they designed an airplane that was easy to maneuver

437
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:02,614
but was not terribly stable.

438
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:05,283
Many other people designed
stable airplanes

439
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,486
that were difficult to maneuver.

440
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:10,489
Em, a side effect
of this is that, em,

441
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:13,492
it's boring to sit there
and stabilize an airplane.

442
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:20,999
And you can see there on the
plane up here, em, there is, em,

443
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:23,001
Eh, Sperry's son
is sitting there

444
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:26,004
and they put an autopilot
on this plane

445
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:30,642
and, em, eh, th-th-the mechanic was walking on the wing

446
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,377
to introduce a perturbation

447
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:34,713
and you can see that it's
pretty close to the ground.

448
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:38,817
So i-in-in, around 1913
this autopilot

449
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:42,487
won the prize for the most stable airplane at, eh,

450
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:43,488
in Paris.

451
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,490
And I've taken this
from the Honeywell book.

452
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,491
In that they say,

453
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,794
"An interesting feature is
the proximity to the ground."

454
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:50,462
(laughing)

455
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:54,866
And down there on the left you can see the Wright Brothers

456
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:58,370
and then you can see,
em, eh, Minorsky

457
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:02,474
who was a ship engineer, eh, who was very heavily involved

458
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:05,143
in the interaction between stability and control.

459
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:09,548
Here's another field, telecommunications.

460
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:14,052
Em, the problem was how can you
communicate over long distances?

461
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:16,054
And to do this you
needed amplification.

462
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:19,424
So you needed to make
a good amplifier.

463
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:22,060
We are not talking
about 1920, 1930.

464
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,863
And their amp, the amplifying device at that time

465
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:28,333
was the electronic tube,
a pretty crummy device.

466
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,534
It gave you amplification,

467
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:30,869
but it was non-linear

468
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:33,572
and it had time
bearing characteristic.

469
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:35,807
And then we had some brilliant
people who we, eh,

470
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:39,177
at Bell Labs invented
the feedback amplifier.

471
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:42,414
So what did, eh,
it was done by Black.

472
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,916
And the idea was that,

473
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:48,753
how can you make a system out
a bad component?

474
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:50,222
And the-uh-the answer was

475
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:52,691
by using feedback
you can actually do this.

476
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:54,693
And you see this
calculation down here

477
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:56,194
for a feedback amplifier,

478
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:59,231
that, eh, if you, if-arrange a feedback in here,

479
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:01,266
you look at the-the gain.

480
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,969
It's essentially if k is
large, the gain is large.

481
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:05,437
These two terms disappeared

482
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:08,607
and essentially R2 over R1
which are passive component.

483
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:12,277
So that was the key idea
of the feedback amplifier.

484
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:14,679
Of course, again, people run
into stability problems.

485
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,248
Here they call it singing

486
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:19,184
because this amplifier
started to, y'know,

487
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,186
this sort of sound you had here in the beginning

488
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,455
with the microphone
and the loud speaker.

489
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,590
So therefore you had to do
stability theory

490
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,958
and there are two giants.

491
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:31,429
Bode, who I was told grew up
here in Urbana,

492
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:36,167
and, em, eh, his father was a professor here in

493
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:37,502
classics or languages,

494
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:39,738
and there were Harry Nyquist who grew up in Sweden.

495
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:44,643
Eh, the reason why feedback
is used so much

496
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,078
that that's a tremendous power.

497
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:49,781
You can make accurate system
from imprecise component

498
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:52,017
like you did
in electronic amplifiers.

499
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:53,852
You can reduce effects
of disturbances

500
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:56,721
and component variation
like you do in process control.

501
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,758
You can regulate, stabilize,
and shape behavior.

502
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,192
You're a fantastic properties.

503
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:03,028
So what are the drawbacks?

504
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:05,830
Drawback number one
is risk for instability.

505
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:09,501
And that's why stability has played such an important role

506
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,303
in control engineering.

507
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,305
Y'know, you really
have to know,

508
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:15,173
you have to know your enemies.

509
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:17,208
[laughing]

510
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:18,977
The other thing about feedback

511
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:21,746
is that you are feeding sensor noise into the system

512
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,582
so that noise will create
a lot of action

513
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:25,717
that you would like to avoid.

514
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:27,152
So these are the two drawbacks.

515
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:29,621
But, of course, if you look
to the advantages

516
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,656
we have a lot of positive things going for us.

517
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:35,427
So the scene of 1940 was
widespread use of control

518
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,528
in many fields

519
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,530
and I gave you examples of this.

520
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,531
I listed them there.

521
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:41,533
The similarities
were not realized.

522
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:44,703
So what it took to-to realize the similarities was essentially

523
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:47,472
the Second World War.

524
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:50,942
So during the Second World
War, what happened was that,

525
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,677
em, politicians realized

526
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:57,349
that science could have a major impact on the outcome of a war.

527
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,951
And here in United States
and in other places,

528
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:03,722
want organized laboratories around universities

529
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:06,891
which were going to develop the m-m-military tools,

530
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:07,892
the radar, etc.

531
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:10,528
And of course very prominent here in the United States

532
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:12,597
was the effort around MIT.

533
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:14,833
So I want to, gunsights,
radar, etc.

534
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:17,102
So the concepts were to use feedback and feedforward.

535
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:19,204
And what happened then is that
they brought in people

536
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:20,872
who had very different talents.

537
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:22,307
They brought in people,
for example,

538
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,042
who new about autopilots.

539
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:26,044
They brought in
people from Bell Labs.

540
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:28,413
They brought in people from
the process control industry.

541
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:29,714
And then people discovered

542
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:31,716
we have actually been doing
the same thing.

543
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:33,685
And then control emerged.

544
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:37,355
And, em, the, eh, design tools were block diagrams

545
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:38,390
and transfer functions.

546
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:41,860
The simulation tools
were analog simulation.

547
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,328
Implementation was again

548
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,264
that whenever you would have to build a controller you's,

549
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:48,867
you essentially using
analog techniques.

550
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:50,869
And at that time
there was a holistic view

551
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,070
of theory and applications.

552
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:55,073
So, essentially, the same groups
who were doing application,

553
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:56,074
were also doing theory.

554
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,412
Eh, here's a little picture
of servomechanism theory.

555
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:03,915
Eh, the picture on the left
illustrates, em,

556
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:06,184
the block diagram,
which is a very nice way

557
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,887
of abstracting away details
from a technical system.

558
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:12,290
The picture in the middle show a
hardware in the loop simulation

559
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,026
from the Saab Airplane Company
around 1952,

560
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:18,063
and you see an analog computer sitting there, on the right.

561
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:20,065
The theory was
Laplace transforms

562
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:21,066
and complex variables.

563
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:23,034
System concepts,
feedback, feedforward.

564
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:26,404
Design was frequency response,
a lot of graphical methods,

565
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:28,807
and then analog simulation
and analog implementation.

566
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,644
Here's one of the early books
on control.

567
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:35,013
The reason it's called
Servomechanism Theory.

568
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:36,014
And notice,

569
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:38,450
it's written by a professor
of physics from Purdue.

570
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,985
It's written by
an instrument engineer

571
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:42,554
from an instrument company,

572
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,122
Nathaniel Nichols,

573
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:48,059
and a first rate abstract mathematician, Ralph Phillips

574
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,295
from, eh, University
of Southern California.

575
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:53,832
Cert its conception,
control was multidisciplinary

576
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:55,834
with a strong footing
in mathematics,

577
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:57,135
a strong footing in physics,

578
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,003
and a strong footing
in instrumentation.

579
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:03,608
The consequences
of this were tremendous.

580
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:06,878
We were getting e-education of
control engineers, sort of.

581
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:08,913
Control courses
sprung up everywhere.

582
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,915
They came in different
departments, mechanical,

583
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,651
electric, sometimes
in civil engineering.

584
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:16,721
Eh, we got organizations where
the most prominent is IFAC,

585
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:18,723
International Federation
of Automatic Control,

586
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:21,159
was founded '57.

587
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,161
Eh, there was industrialization.

588
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:25,663
The company was
specializing on control.

589
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:27,665
Like Johnson Control,
like Honeywell.

590
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:29,667
We got journals
and we got conferences

591
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:33,838
and I think today, there's a control conference every week.

592
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:36,407
I think every subject
would have been proud of this,

593
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,710
and we are now come
roughly to 1960.

594
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:44,716
So, in 1960 I said we
had a paradigm shift.

595
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,985
And in my mind
the driver was a space race.

596
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:49,721
You know Sputnik came up 1957,

597
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:52,323
generated a fantastic
amount of activity.

598
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:54,859
Another thing that came
around were the computers.

599
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:58,429
So one started to use computers
to solve control,

600
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:00,098
to implement control systems

601
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:02,100
instead of using
analog computers.

602
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,036
And the first installation
was i-was in an oil refinery

603
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:07,172
in Texas in '59.

604
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:11,009
Eh, also it was discovered that the tools that were available

605
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:13,945
at the time, in 1960
were insufficient.

606
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:16,714
So what happened then,
we turned a lot to mathematics

607
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:19,184
to bring in, y'know,
new tools and new ideas.

608
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:22,053
There was a rapid growth
of s-subspecialties,

609
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:26,191
optimal control, stochastic control, nonlinear control, etc.

610
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:28,193
We also got computational tools.

611
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:29,627
Y'know, MATLAB today is a

612
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:32,096
successor of what was
developed at the time.

613
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:34,866
There was a very impressive
development of theory,

614
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:38,703
but the holistic view was lost.

615
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:41,306
Eh, I've sometimes
said at the time that, em,

616
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:43,408
there were many professors
of control

617
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:47,879
who had a platonic view
of control systems.

618
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:50,381
They talked a lot about them,
but they never touched them.

619
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:51,816
[laughing]

620
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:54,819
And, em, that illustrates, y'know, the, uh, lack of the

621
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:56,888
holistic view.

622
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:58,556
Eh, I'll give you a
couple of examples.

623
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:01,025
One of the most promising one-eh, p-prominent one

624
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,994
was optimal control theory.

625
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:06,497
Eh, it was built on-on, eh, classical results,

626
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:09,434
like by Hamilton and Euler.

627
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:12,270
And then we had Bellman who
developed dynamic programming,

628
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,272
direct descendant
of Hamilton and Jacobi.

629
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:16,708
We had Pontryagin,
who you can say,

630
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,710
his ideas were direct descendents

631
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,711
of Euler and Lagrange.

632
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,913
And today we have what you
call model predictive control.

633
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:24,048
A lot of this was driven
by the space race.

634
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,150
Y'know, you would like to
shoot up a heavy satellite

635
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,418
with a weak rocket,

636
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:30,154
you better do it
in the right way.

637
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:32,156
Eh, and here I just gave
two books,

638
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:34,025
one by Bellman
and one by Pontryagin.

639
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,362
Another very important
thing that happened

640
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:38,630
was the Kalman filtering.

641
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,365
And I put Wiener
right on the left

642
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:42,634
because Wiener filtering
was the predecessor.

643
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:46,471
In-in many senses a lot of the
machine was developed by him.

644
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,239
And then Kalman came along

645
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:52,310
and found very efficient ways
to filter signals

646
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,312
and he could
combine measurements

647
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:57,715
with mathematical models to
es-to do estimation.

648
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,717
So that's the basis
of the Kalman filtering.

649
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:01,986
Another thing is that we also
got a new structure

650
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:03,187
of the controller.

651
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:05,590
Instead of the controller
being a black box,

652
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,791
we now saw that the controller

653
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:08,793
should have a couple
of components,

654
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:09,794
a Kalman filter, here,

655
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:12,030
that receives all the
information from the process.

656
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,899
It generates, best
estimate of the state.

657
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:18,703
Then we have here a feedforward
generator that-that generates

658
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:20,772
both feedforward signal, that drives the system

659
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:21,973
where we would like it to go

660
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:25,143
and also desire-generates desired behavior of the state

661
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:27,345
and then we just do
state feedback up here.

662
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:31,482
So, that was something that we
got out of the Kalman's work

663
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:32,483
and the Kalman filtering.

664
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,454
We also got system
identification,

665
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,990
a methodology to get out mathematical models

666
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,525
from experiments.

667
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:44,462
This is data I made myself in a
paper factory in the early 60s.

668
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,130
We which-we, uh, wanted to know

669
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,200
how does a big factory
behave from input/output

670
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,202
and then you persuade the people

671
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:53,338
to let you change things
during production

672
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:56,140
and you measure important variables in the end.

673
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:00,044
And then based on this data
you, em, eh, you estimate

674
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:02,580
mathematical relations
between these ones.

675
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,817
And the typical idea is that
by-by doing better control

676
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,685
you can move closer to tolerances here

677
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:09,153
and you can save money.

678
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,923
So here's a tip, one of the first experiments we did

679
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:14,592
when we were controlling the thickness of paper accurately.

680
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:16,861
It was a project that IBM
was running together

681
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:18,096
with the Swedish paper mill.

682
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,265
Here's another area,
adaptive control.

683
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:27,505
Em, one of the things, eh, it actually came up, er,

684
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,340
from aerospace

685
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,377
because when airplanes
started to go supersonic,

686
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,345
the dynamics changed.

687
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,513
And then it was not enough

688
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,515
to have an autopilot
with fixed settings

689
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:41,119
so one tried to do an autopilot that could adjust itself

690
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,954
to changing flight conditions.

691
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:45,189
The early experiments
were not too successful.

692
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,892
There was a famous crash
on the X-15, for example.

693
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:49,861
So the field has been
going up and down

694
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,696
and has continued
to go up and down.

695
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,564
Eh, one of the things
I've been concerned with

696
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:56,033
was called
the self-tuning regulator.

697
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:57,702
Eh, there was a lot of
theory developed.

698
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,337
There were case studies.

699
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:01,305
Eh, I've given here
a couple of products

700
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:03,474
that I will skip
because of time.

701
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:04,642
I'll give you one
example, though.

702
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:06,744
A ship steering autopilot.

703
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:08,980
This was something
we developed from my lab

704
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,449
together with a local
shipyard in Kockums.

705
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,984
And when I Google this now,

706
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:16,320
the autopilot is still marketed by Northrop Grumman.

707
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,189
And here I gave you an example.

708
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:20,825
A typical autopilot
runs a PID controller,

709
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:22,827
and here you see
what is happening,

710
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:24,929
how the course is deviating

711
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:27,031
when you're running
in pretty bad weather

712
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:29,434
and here you see
what the rudder is doing.

713
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,969
When we switched on the adaptive
controller in here,

714
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:35,006
you see what happens to
the course deviations.

715
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:37,275
You don't have to do an analysis
to see that this is better.

716
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:40,778
The reason that the adaptive
controller can do it here,

717
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:41,979
it knows about waves

718
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:44,315
and it's trying to estimate
what the wave motion is.

719
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:45,316
And you can also see,

720
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:48,119
we are not using
larger rudder motions

721
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,121
than what you are doing
with the PID controller.

722
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:52,123
That's a little bit more
high frequency in here.

723
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:54,292
So I would say that this is a
very nice example of

724
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:55,893
adaptive control

725
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:58,729
that was done 30 years ago,

726
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:01,799
and the products are still here, here running.

727
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:05,570
One nice thing here is that you
know quite a bit about ships

728
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:08,039
so one can actual do a
physics-based initialization

729
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,040
of the system.

730
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,042
So if you know basic data
about the ship,

731
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,176
you can roughly figure out

732
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:13,778
what the initial parameters
are going to be.

733
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:19,550
Em, here's a special
subject I will take up.

734
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:23,688
Because in the early phase
of servomechanism,

735
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:26,991
people knew that there were limitations of control.

736
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:29,627
People knew that
time delays are bad.

737
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,996
People knew that
instabilities are bad.

738
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:32,997
People know that

739
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:36,000
what we call zeros in the
right-half-plane, are bad.

740
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,103
When, em, the so-called modern
control theory came around

741
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:42,139
with Kalman filters
and state feedback,

742
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:46,744
these conditions somehow
did not show up,

743
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:49,580
if you looked upon the way people were looking about it.

744
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,083
So then people say,
eh, well, y'know,

745
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:55,353
maybe these limitations
are not so serious anyway.

746
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:57,355
And, eh, uh,
I attended conference

747
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:58,556
that were violent discussions,

748
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:00,992
y'know, between the people
who were advocating,

749
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,294
what was at the time called, modern control theory

750
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:04,929
and the classic guys.

751
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:06,931
The classic guys were saying
like this,

752
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:10,668
oh, time delays are limitations.

753
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:13,137
It must come into the theory.

754
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:15,139
Zeros in the right-half-planes
are very bad.

755
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,207
They must come in.

756
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:19,176
And then the guys sitting there
on the-the modern control say,

757
00:36:19,176 --> 00:36:20,745
oh, y'know, you guys are stupid.

758
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:22,146
Y'know, you don't know
about matrixes,

759
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:23,314
calculations like this.

760
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:26,751
So we have this fantastic
robustness property, etc.

761
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:28,219
Well in the end,

762
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,488
so it was almost like
religious battles, y'know.

763
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:33,124
So instead of sitting down
and-and asking,

764
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:36,360
trying out what the problem was and resolving it,

765
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,995
y-you becam-you got
a religious fight

766
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:39,163
that lasted for several years.

767
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:41,866
So it took a long time
to figure this out.

768
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,868
And I'm very pleased to say that

769
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,971
eh, one of the first glimpses
of what was going on

770
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:49,473
was actually presented at the Allerton Conference

771
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:52,810
by this man here,
which is called George Zames,

772
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:57,481
in 1979.

773
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:58,516
Am I correct now?

774
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:00,051
Yes, 79.

775
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,553
So that was the first time
it came up that

776
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,656
there's probably something about the fundamental limitations

777
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:07,158
about time delays.

778
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:08,159
And then it took a while,

779
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,796
eh, but the, and of course what contributed to this

780
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:16,100
was that state space had a i-had infinite gain margin

781
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,868
and phase margin of 60 degrees.

782
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:19,136
Of course that had
to do with the fact

783
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:20,805
that you're measuring
all the state values.

784
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:23,474
When you do output feedback,
this is not at all true.

785
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:25,876
So then the field of robust
control came around,

786
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:28,846
and Youla, who was
very active here

787
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:30,648
from the first
Allerton Conference,

788
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:33,551
was one of the key
contributors to this.

789
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:34,986
And then there was a very
famous paper

790
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:38,255
that's called the four-author paper by John Doyle,

791
00:37:38,255 --> 00:37:41,058
eh, Keith Glover, Khargonekar, and Bruce Francis.

792
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:42,927
I couldn't find a good picture
of Bruce Francis,

793
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:43,995
but he should be here.

794
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:45,062
[laughing]

795
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:47,365
And, em, it,
then it became very clear

796
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:49,900
that there are indeed fundamental limitations.

797
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,803
So, y'know, the classical guys
were right about this.

798
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:57,041
And also, eh, one figured out
the way to solve this.

799
00:37:57,041 --> 00:38:00,244
Then, another thing
happened here in Illinois.

800
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:04,081
Eh, you recognize
our friend here?

801
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:06,617
And he had a colleague in France
called Pierre Bernhard,

802
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,419
and they said well,
it's all games.

803
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:09,420
See, in other words,

804
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,422
they formulated the robust control problem

805
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:12,823
as a game problem.

806
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:15,459
Nature is providing
the bad perturbations

807
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,429
and what you are doing is that you're playing against nature.

808
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:20,131
The very nice consequence
of this

809
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:23,501
is that it opened up the area
to do robust control

810
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:25,136
for nonlinear systems.

811
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,605
The other approaches
that were done before,

812
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:29,607
they were limited
to linear systems.

813
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:30,975
But now when you treat it
as a game,

814
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:31,976
from a different viewpoint,

815
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,310
you could suddenly,

816
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,079
you could suddently tackle
nonlinear problems

817
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:35,980
you couldn't do before.

818
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,016
So that was a little
bit about the past.

819
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:42,887
And I didn't dare to go f-more
than to roughly 1980

820
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:45,456
because one of my colleagues who was a professor of history said,

821
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:47,625
"Never, ever talk
about recent things

822
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,627
because you'll never have
a good perspective on them."

823
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,762
So I was brave
when I went to 1980.

824
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:53,664
I didn't want to go any further.

825
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,434
So now I'll talk
about the present.

826
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:59,904
And, em, eh, about applications.

827
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:03,007
There are lots and lots and lots
of applications of control

828
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,442
in the traditional fields,

829
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,610
and this application
are expanding.

830
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,513
So we have it in power
systems, in process control,

831
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:13,284
in aerospace, in automotives,
in buildings and robotics.

832
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:14,819
We have it in computer systems.

833
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:17,088
We have it also at other levels.

834
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:19,857
For example, in global
enterprise control.

835
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,058
You have it in advertisement.

836
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:22,326
You have it in
mobile telephones.

837
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:23,561
You have it in art and games,

838
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:25,696
and you have it in physics
and biology.

839
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,499
So not only the tra-traditional
fields are expanding

840
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:30,534
but also the application
fields are expanding.

841
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:33,704
I'll give ya, I'll give you
illustrations of this.

842
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,773
Here is, for example,
a process control example.

843
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:37,775
It's also something
I've been involved with.

844
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:39,777
A simple way to tune
simple controllers.

845
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:42,246
So there's a PID controller
that you would like to tune,

846
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:44,815
what you do is set
the switch in a relay here.

847
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:46,283
Then you get like a thermostat.

848
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:48,285
And what happens
with a thermostat,

849
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:50,755
the tempers starts to oscillate, start to swing.

850
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:54,558
Well, the swinging there
contains useful information,

851
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:57,695
so by analyzing the swinging you
can pick up enough information

852
00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:58,896
to tune a PID controller

853
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,265
and then you can just switch it, switch it over.

854
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:02,666
It's a robust and easy to use.

855
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,235
It's well adapted to users.

856
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,237
You can just have a button
that you push,

857
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,839
and it's done by quite a large company, at the time,

858
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:10,875
so there are hundreds of thousands of,

859
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:14,044
of these sort of devices
out there today.

860
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:16,046
I-I gave you a nice
example of this.

861
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:20,518
This comes from, em, em,
a paper mill

862
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,553
up in Naven, Sweden.

863
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:26,190
And, em, eh, I wasn't
there myself, so I,

864
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,558
this is second-hand story.

865
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:29,794
So my-my colleagues
were up there.

866
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:31,796
They had been a student of
these controllers

867
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:32,530
with automatic tuning.

868
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:33,864
And typical commission a factory

869
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:36,700
is something that typically takes a week or two.

870
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,536
Y-y'know, you have to
fix up the instruments.

871
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:40,037
You have to
tune controllers, etc.

872
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:41,705
In this case they did it
in three days.

873
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:44,375
So what they did, they make, uh, sure the instruments right.

874
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,110
Connect one of these
autotunes and push a button.

875
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,211
This loop is clear.

876
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:48,345
Go to the other loop.

877
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:50,381
So people were very
happy about this.

878
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:52,383
So they said, well can't you use this magic device

879
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:54,852
on this beast of process
we have here

880
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:57,154
that we have not really
been able to control.

881
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:58,889
And this was a destination tower

882
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:00,424
and I'll show you here what's happening.

883
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:01,992
Eh, time is running this way.

884
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:03,661
It's one of these old
fashioned instruments.

885
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:05,262
You see here it's oscillating.

886
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:08,499
And this is run under,
under PID control.

887
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:12,036
Eh, well here, uthm,
what is this?

888
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:15,005
This is, ah,
roughly before launch.

889
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:17,174
You put it,
control into manual

890
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:19,510
and then
the oscillation stopped.

891
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,512
Here at 2 o'clock
in the afternoon

892
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:22,513
they push the tuning button.

893
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:23,547
They push a button.

894
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:25,549
So now what-what's
happening here,

895
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:27,551
you have, essentially,
the relay feedback.

896
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:28,552
Here, in the beginning,

897
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:31,188
you are just measuring a little bit of noise and hysteresis

898
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:34,291
and then you can see it's not in a perfect sinusoidal iteration

899
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:36,627
but it's enough to pick out
the dynamics.

900
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:38,629
And of course here people
are starting to get worried.

901
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:39,630
It doesn't work.

902
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,632
And in there the controller has
figured out by itself

903
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:44,034
that now I know what parameters are and I can regulate,

904
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:46,036
and then see how well
it regulates.

905
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:48,038
And this takes from 2:00 in the
afternoon 'til,

906
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:50,941
what is it here?

907
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:53,577
Eh, it's, uh, 7:00 o'clock
in the evening.

908
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:58,182
So, it's a long time,
but, eh,it tuned successfully.

909
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,885
So I think this is a nice little
example of automatic tuning.

910
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,688
Here's a very different example.

911
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:07,391
This is a comp-ehh,
it's a factory complex.

912
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:08,659
Eh, again, a paper factory.

913
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:10,794
You have lots
of manufacturing units

914
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:13,130
and then you have
storage tanks, etc.

915
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:17,134
And here the problem is to run the whole factory in a, in, eh,

916
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:18,135
a sensible way.

917
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:20,938
Eh, this is work that
was done by ABB.

918
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:24,608
And what they do is that they've
been doing mathematic

919
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:25,743
and model of the whole thing.

920
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:26,977
The model is partic-complicate.

921
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:30,014
It's about, er, a few
thousand variables.

922
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:33,484
So what they do is that they
estimate the state from sensors.

923
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:36,987
Then they run an optimization
program, and then they simulate.

924
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:38,389
And at this stage

925
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,457
they give commands to the people

926
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:42,459
who are running
the different units

927
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:45,796
about how they are going to chan-change production settings.

928
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:48,699
Some of the production settings
are set there automatically.

929
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:50,968
So it's an example of, em, automation

930
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:53,637
of-of a more complex systems.

931
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:55,306
Em, this then grew up.

932
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:57,308
This would be typical
process control.

933
00:42:57,308 --> 00:43:00,077
This would be the manufacturing
system I was talking about.

934
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,646
What's happening now is control
is now creeping up together

935
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:04,782
with the business systems.

936
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:07,885
Em, so, for example, Wal-Mart is
one of the companies

937
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:11,322
who's most skilled at dealing with this higher level here

938
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:14,391
to keep, y'know, storage of things like this, um,

939
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:14,992
at a low level.

940
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:20,064
Here's another example that
comes from General Electric.

941
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:22,399
Eh, it's what's called
a trip optimizer.

942
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:25,636
It has to do with how you should
run freight trains effectively.

943
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:28,839
Eh, and the trick
to run freight trains

944
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:31,909
is that you should try to,
you should arrive

945
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:32,910
in the right time

946
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:35,412
and you should avoid braking
as much as possible.

947
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:37,414
So what General Electric
has done

948
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:39,850
is that they have applied optimal control

949
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,152
and then they have made a nice implementation of a system.

950
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:44,989
So, they are using
wireless links,

951
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:48,525
eh, s-so, to on board computers so you can know what you are.

952
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:50,828
There are maps, you know
what the terrain looks like.

953
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:52,296
So if you are going
to go up a hill

954
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,530
you can go a little bit faster.

955
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:54,865
When you go down, etc.

956
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:56,834
You shouldn't brake
when you go down.

957
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:59,570
And then they have done an
integrated system like this

958
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,572
that is run by
the train operators.

959
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:04,875
So this system is now, eh,
in commercial operation.

960
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:10,414
In automotive, I think that
deserves a special slide

961
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:13,717
because automotive is a strong
technology driver.

962
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:15,386
Y'know, there are so many cars

963
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:17,788
and the car companies
are so powerful

964
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:20,524
so they can get, em, CMI manufacturing companies

965
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:24,361
to do things they may not
otherwise be willing to do.

966
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:29,166
So for example, eh, eh, they persuaded Intel and Motorola

967
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,901
to do the micro controller.

968
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:31,902
In other words, eh, eh,

969
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:36,140
it's a computer with built-in
A to D and D to A.

970
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:39,910
And also, right now, eh, the automotive industry's pushing

971
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:41,578
the sensory industry, very much

972
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:43,580
so we are getting
cheap accelerometers

973
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,282
and cheap gyroscopes.

974
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:49,486
And, em, i-i-it
started with them,

975
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:53,290
engine control, because it was impossible to satisfy

976
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:55,592
the California emission standard

977
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:58,262
without, with-with
tradition means.

978
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:01,198
So the only way to do this
was to introduce feedback.

979
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:02,332
So that's what's happened.

980
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:05,803
And then once you started to get
a computer into the car,

981
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:07,838
there were many opportunities
to many other things.

982
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:09,640
So then you, one,
got cruise control.

983
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,141
You got adaptive cruise control.

984
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:12,876
Today you get
collision avoidance

985
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,845
and you get traction control.

986
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:17,881
And you get also
line gade-guided assistance.

987
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,784
And also one is moving
to traffic flow control.

988
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:23,587
There was a very interesting
project run at, uh,

989
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:27,157
by University of Berkeley
on platooning of cars.

990
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:31,261
Em, you wanted to, eh, get more
throughput on the highway

991
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:33,997
by shortening the distances between cars

992
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:36,934
and then you were going to run them automatically with about,

993
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:38,936
y'know, half a meter
between them

994
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:40,904
and then you can push through cars very quickly.

995
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:43,240
You can say it's a way
of making trains out of cars,

996
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,175
but it was
an interesting project.

997
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:48,979
Now here's, em, eh, another one of this namely for, for, trucks.

998
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:52,950
This is done by Scania, which
is a Swedish car company, KTH.

999
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,952
So by running trucks
close to each other, here,

1000
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:59,022
you can reduce a lot of the,
a-air resistance between them.

1001
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:01,592
And in a modern k-t-car today there are about 80,

1002
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:04,428
you could say there's
about 80 control systems

1003
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:07,965
or 80, eh, microprocessors.

1004
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:11,001
And the way the automotive
industry deals with complexity

1005
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:13,570
is that, they buy
the whole system.

1006
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:14,571
They buy the sensor.

1007
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:15,572
They buy the actuator.

1008
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:16,573
They buy the computer.

1009
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:21,178
And that was all right if
you had, em, handful of systems.

1010
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:23,847
Eh, now when you're getting
80 of them

1011
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:25,983
where some of them may use the same sensory information

1012
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:27,618
it's getting more complicated.

1013
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,087
So now there's a very strong
push in the automotive industry

1014
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:33,023
to get an infrastructure
where they can do this.

1015
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:35,025
There's also a problem about
specifications

1016
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:37,027
because typical
specifications here,

1017
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:40,397
you write a little book in English about half an inch thick

1018
00:46:40,397 --> 00:46:42,432
and they hand this to some of the manufacturers

1019
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:44,468
and say, okay,
this is what I want.

1020
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,470
And then they send you
an electronic book

1021
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,471
and say here it is.

1022
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,573
So the question is,
how do you verify this?

1023
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:51,575
And how do you make
sure that it works?

1024
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:53,310
And of course it
doesn't always work.

1025
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,113
So this is one of the areas
where there's a tremendous need

1026
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:57,848
for systematic procedures.

1027
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,818
Em, here's another example.

1028
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:05,722
Eh, it's, em, automotive
powertrain control.

1029
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:08,859
Eh, and it's a nice system
done by Honeywell

1030
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:11,228
which are selling
to car manufacturers

1031
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:13,297
so that the car manufacturers can introduce

1032
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:16,200
optimizing control into cars.

1033
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,303
Eh, I think I'm going
to skip this one.

1034
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:21,138
Eh, also, mobile telephones.

1035
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:23,140
I think this is
really interesting.

1036
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:27,311
Em, here is an example of a
mobile telephone in the 1980s.

1037
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:29,179
You see price.

1038
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,748
Eh, very expensive.

1039
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:35,319
And you take one today,
about 13 dollars.

1040
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:37,321
The weight, 4 kilograms.

1041
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:39,223
Now it's 60 kilograms.

1042
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:41,225
And if you look to the control
loops, there are about 10,

1043
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:43,594
10 critical control loops
in a phone.

1044
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:45,629
And then you multiply by
the number of phones per year.

1045
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:48,365
So, i-in the mobile industry is actually leading

1046
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,834
in terms of number
of control loops.

1047
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:52,836
So this is the number
of control loops you have

1048
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:54,238
in mobile telephones per year.

1049
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:55,906
So they require some attention.

1050
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:57,808
You do frequency control.

1051
00:47:57,808 --> 00:48:01,078
Em, you do power control
and gain control.

1052
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:03,113
And mostly it's fairly
simple controls,

1053
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:05,282
but you had to pay careful attention to them

1054
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:06,717
because you manufacture
so many of them.

1055
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:10,654
There are actually 6,000 people

1056
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:12,656
who work in mobile
telephone technology

1057
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:14,258
right next to our university

1058
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:15,592
which is kind of interesting
for us.

1059
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:19,463
Em, here's another area,
which I think, should be

1060
00:48:19,463 --> 00:48:21,431
of prime importance
for this campus.

1061
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:24,201
You're going to get this
super computer coming here.

1062
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:27,838
Uh, this super computer is
generating a lot of heat.

1063
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:31,408
That you have to get, you have to buy the electricity for it

1064
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,543
and then you have to
supply the heating.

1065
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:37,848
So, control of computing centers
is becoming very important.

1066
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:42,019
And it's both a matter of
allocating the resources.

1067
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:45,922
Eh, you have a lot of jobs coming into the, the cloud

1068
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:47,958
and then you have to
allocate the resources

1069
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:50,227
in the computer system to deal with this in an efficient way.

1070
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:52,963
You also have to have
to manage energy.

1071
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:55,365
And typically in the system you
can lower the voltage by,

1072
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:58,035
thereby, y'know,
reducing the clock speed

1073
00:48:58,035 --> 00:48:59,336
and you're reducing,

1074
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:01,305
you're reducing power consumption energy.

1075
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:03,774
They're quite interesting
control problems to do this.

1076
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,909
And you're certainly going to
get one of these problems,

1077
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:06,910
here, on campus,

1078
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:08,612
which could be a very interesting test case.

1079
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:12,182
So they said the same thing about data management

1080
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:13,483
in computing centers.

1081
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:18,322
Here's a somewhat
unexpected things.

1082
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:20,324
It is about
internet advertising.

1083
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:25,295
Eh, o-one nice thing about the
internet is that, uh,

1084
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,364
uh, the idea is,
how should you design,

1085
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:29,399
er, an advertisement campaign.

1086
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:31,435
Y'know, you're putting in
money to do this and this

1087
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:34,705
and that and you are expecting
a certain outcome.

1088
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:36,573
Eh, a nice thing about
the internet is that

1089
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:39,943
it's very easy to measure
the outcome quickly.

1090
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:42,546
Em, and, em, there is a company

1091
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:47,451
called Advertisement.Inc, originally.

1092
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:51,154
It was founded by a son
of Leuenberger who is

1093
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,989
one of our community.

1094
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:54,725
It's, eh, out in Palo Alto.

1095
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:56,493
And they are doing
systems like this.

1096
00:49:56,493 --> 00:50:00,297
So they are doing systems
to, essentially,

1097
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:03,500
automate a use optimization for inter-internet advertisement

1098
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,069
and they are using the sort of typical tools that we have,

1099
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:08,004
y'know, modeling
and feedback control.

1100
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:13,543
Then I have to talk about
art and games,

1101
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:15,545
and I, this slide
is sort of violent.

1102
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:17,647
It's done by young people.

1103
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:20,784
So I have to, I had to stop.

1104
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:22,786
Y'know, they can look at
many things at the same time.

1105
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:26,022
I would, would like you
to look at this.

1106
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:30,260
Em, this is done
by Raff D'Andrea,

1107
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:33,897
eh, who was at Cornell who is now professor at the ETH

1108
00:50:33,897 --> 00:50:37,567
and, em, this is what he calls The Chair.

1109
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:39,970
It starts like this

1110
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:42,472
and then,

1111
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:45,142
eh, it falls down

1112
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:46,443
and then it starts over again.

1113
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:49,446
This is in a museum in Toronto.

1114
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:52,382
Eh, he has also done
other things.

1115
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:56,453
So this is a, eh, a,
a nice piece of art.

1116
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:57,854
Here's another one.

1117
00:50:57,854 --> 00:51:01,858
I know there are people here who
are interested in quadrocopters.

1118
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:04,694
So these are quadrocopters
in Switzerland.

1119
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:06,763
You see there roughly
what they look like.

1120
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:08,832
And they are building pyramids.

1121
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:15,839
And of course this stones are

1122
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,841
lighter than what
the Egyptians had,

1123
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:18,842
[laughing]

1124
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:21,144
eh, but they certainly
build quicker.

1125
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:22,345
So I think it's
interesting to see

1126
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:26,116
that control is now moving into the, the art world.

1127
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:28,351
And, em, Raff D'Andrea was also,

1128
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:29,786
I-I'm going to stop this one.

1129
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:32,222
You are, not like
my grandchildren

1130
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:34,224
because they all fall
at the same time.

1131
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:37,327
Eh, he also participated very
successful in the RoboCup

1132
00:51:37,327 --> 00:51:40,230
where little robots were
playing soccer together.

1133
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:41,531
So, y'know, they are
running around there

1134
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:43,500
and trying to beat
the other team.

1135
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,036
Eh, I think Raff D'Andrea
won the World Cup twice

1136
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:47,204
or something like this.

1137
00:51:48,972 --> 00:51:51,241
Eh, but this is not only games.

1138
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:52,576
The same team have done this

1139
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:55,779
with the same type
of technology.

1140
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,815
It's about, em, eh,
doing warehouses.

1141
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:00,851
For example, when Amazon is
going to package books

1142
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:01,852
and send them to you.

1143
00:52:01,852 --> 00:52:03,753
And what they have done

1144
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:06,389
is that by using feedback,
they have been able to use

1145
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:09,326
very simple devices

1146
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:11,328
and then they are using feedback

1147
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:13,163
to make very accurate
motion based on this.

1148
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:15,599
So they are, they are using
the feedback,

1149
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,835
feedback tricks and, em, eh,

1150
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:20,403
they are not only
playing games like this,

1151
00:52:20,403 --> 00:52:23,106
they're also doing real things that are now making profit.

1152
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:24,608
Eh, this is called Kiva Systems

1153
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:27,310
and I think the company
has now been bought by Amazon.

1154
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:34,317
Now, The Chair was in the
National Gallery of Canada,

1155
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:36,653
so I think it's nice that control has made its,

1156
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:37,521
made its mark there.

1157
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:43,927
Em, well, control has also
had impact in physics.

1158
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:46,863
And there are two people who
have got the Nobel Prize

1159
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:48,798
in physics for control effort.

1160
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:51,601
The first one was a Swedish
engineer called Gustaf Dalen,

1161
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:54,638
who invented the switch
for lighthouses.

1162
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:56,172
Y'know, lighthouses,

1163
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:58,642
when it's dark, you want to switch the switch on,

1164
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:01,411
and when it's light,
you will switch it off.

1165
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:02,712
And he had a very simple idea.

1166
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:06,650
He was using,
three polished metal bars

1167
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:08,251
and one black metal bar.

1168
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:10,420
When, eh, light is shining,

1169
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,756
y'know, the, em, the-the black one e-expands

1170
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:14,257
and then it was open like this

1171
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:17,527
and it revolutionized lighthouses all over the world.

1172
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:20,730
The second one is a Dutch
engineer, Simon van der Meer,

1173
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:23,199
who was working with
this accelerators

1174
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:25,201
where you are sending
particles around a circuit

1175
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:27,504
and he invented something called stochastic cooling.

1176
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:29,005
There're some in-very interesting effects

1177
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:32,108
done right now in quantum
and molecular systems.

1178
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:35,211
And on here I have to mention
this one, too, about,

1179
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:37,981
y'know, I think I'm doing, almost great with time,

1180
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:39,416
I think, yeah.

1181
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:42,619
Eh, y'know, turbulence has always been a challenge

1182
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:44,621
in physics
to explain turbulence.

1183
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:47,791
And, eh, i-it's governed
by Navier-Stokes equations.

1184
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:49,960
A nonlinear partial
differential equations.

1185
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,962
And then people
a long time ago,

1186
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:53,964
they linearized
the Navier-Stokes equations

1187
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:57,634
around, eh, eh, eh,
some behavior

1188
00:53:57,634 --> 00:53:59,703
and then they analyzed

1189
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:02,772
how will the eigenvalues of the linearized motion behave

1190
00:54:02,772 --> 00:54:04,474
when you're changing
Reynolds number.

1191
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:06,776
They found it was
never unstable.

1192
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:08,778
So they couldn't
explain it like this.

1193
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:12,482
So, the rumor went along that you can never explain turbulence

1194
00:54:12,482 --> 00:54:14,517
by linear theory.

1195
00:54:14,517 --> 00:54:17,754
But then, eh, a couple of control theorists, eh,

1196
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:20,023
Mohammed Dahleh, who is no longer with us, unfortunately,

1197
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:21,024
and Bassam Bamieh

1198
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:22,559
They did the following.

1199
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:23,226
They analyzed,

1200
00:54:23,226 --> 00:54:26,429
if you have perturbations
in the world,

1201
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:30,634
how do these perturbations propagate to the velocity field?

1202
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:32,702
And they linearized
this operator.

1203
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:36,039
And then they were analyzing
the gain of that operator.

1204
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:38,041
I mean, how much
of the variations here

1205
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:39,576
propagated into the flow.

1206
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:42,779
And they got very nice
agreement with, eh,

1207
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:45,115
how turbulence changes with Reynolds numbers.

1208
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:48,518
So I think that's one, one, one area where system theory

1209
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:51,221
have contributed to, y'know, classical physics problem.

1210
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:57,327
Then in-in physics, eh, you use feedback in the large scales

1211
00:54:57,327 --> 00:54:58,695
for adaptive optics.

1212
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:00,697
What you're essentially doing
there, is that,

1213
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:03,400
you're reducing the variation that happens

1214
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,735
when the rate is going through the atmosphere

1215
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:07,837
and the speed of light
is changing in the atmosphere.

1216
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:10,040
You get rid of this by feedback.

1217
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,809
The other area here is, uh, is, uh, in the nano scale.

1218
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:15,211
We're using atomic
force microscope

1219
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:18,248
to essentially, look at
surfaces in very details.

1220
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:20,850
And of course both systems
depend very critically on

1221
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:22,519
efficient feedback systems.

1222
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:25,121
If you do, for example, a
better feedback system here,

1223
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:27,323
the biologists are
looking at samples.

1224
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:29,459
Could see a picture, y'know, five times faster

1225
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:30,994
than they can look before,
for example.

1226
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,996
Up here you can get
much sharper images.

1227
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:35,999
Very clear what
control would do here.

1228
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,367
Biology's an interesting one.

1229
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:39,002
Since I'm not a biologist,

1230
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:42,839
em, I-here's a book called
The Way Life Works

1231
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:45,175
and it has seven chapters

1232
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,410
and, eh, one chapter
is about feedback.

1233
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:49,646
And this is a quote
from the book.

1234
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:51,514
"That feedback is a central
feature of life.

1235
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:53,483
"The process of feedback governs
how we grow,

1236
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:54,951
"respond to stress
and challenge,

1237
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:56,586
"and regulate body temperature,

1238
00:55:56,586 --> 00:55:58,021
"blood pressure,
cholesterol level.

1239
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,622
"The mechanisms operate
at every level,

1240
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:02,625
"from the interaction
of proteins to-to organisms."

1241
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:04,661
So that's taken bonafide
from this book.

1242
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:05,795
And, y'know, right now,

1243
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:07,630
there's a lot of activity
in systems biology

1244
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:08,765
and related fields.

1245
00:56:08,765 --> 00:56:10,166
One tries to merge this.

1246
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:12,435
I personally think it's a
difficult thing to do,

1247
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:16,372
eh, but, em, it's certainly
a very worthwhile effort.

1248
00:56:16,372 --> 00:56:18,374
So that was a little
bit about the present.

1249
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:19,409
Now, what about the future?

1250
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:26,149
I think we have some interesting
challenges because, em,

1251
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:28,852
we are now starting to deal
with complex networked systems.

1252
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:31,054
You can think about the
internet itself, for example.

1253
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,655
You can think about
power systems.

1254
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:35,425
You can think about, what you're
talking about smart grids.

1255
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:38,895
When you're gonna, y'know,
to, to charge electric cars.

1256
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:41,197
You're going to use
electric cars for storage.

1257
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:44,434
You're going to generate
electricity in the houses, etc.

1258
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:46,469
We're also getting system
that are called sensor

1259
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:47,904
and actuator rich.

1260
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:50,740
If you take a camera,
y'know, camera with,

1261
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,777
say ten me-megapixels.

1262
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:56,045
Eh, if you then view this
as a sensor,

1263
00:56:56,045 --> 00:57:00,183
it is a sensor which has
a lot of information in it.

1264
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:03,386
And I would say that the systems
we have now in control,

1265
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:04,954
they can easily deal with, say,

1266
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:10,160
20-100 variables, 20-100 variables can deal with well.

1267
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,361
When we're coming into this,

1268
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:13,997
we need to think about systems in a very different way.

1269
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:14,898
And what's going to happen is

1270
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:16,466
that we are to break up
the system.

1271
00:57:16,466 --> 00:57:17,967
It's no longer sufficient

1272
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:19,736
to have the central Kalman filter that sits there

1273
00:57:19,736 --> 00:57:20,637
and do everything.

1274
00:57:20,637 --> 00:57:22,972
We have to have local
feedback in the sensors.

1275
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:24,908
We-if we have,
for example, images

1276
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:27,644
we have to do a lot of work in the images themselves

1277
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:29,312
to pick out
the relevant information.

1278
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:31,381
And this is a
tremendous ch-challenge.

1279
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:33,316
Another thing that's
popping up here

1280
00:57:33,316 --> 00:57:35,318
is safe design
of embedded system.

1281
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:36,986
I mentioned this
problem about the car.

1282
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:39,322
When it's specified something by
a book in English,

1283
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:42,025
it's not easy to verify
what you get this right.

1284
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:43,393
So this is
a tremendous challenge

1285
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:44,828
that we have not solved.

1286
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:46,629
Another one is autonomy,

1287
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,898
and to do autonomy you need to do adaptation, learning,

1288
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:50,500
reasoning, cognition, etc.

1289
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,668
And then we have
the applications

1290
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:52,435
throughout the field,

1291
00:57:52,435 --> 00:57:54,337
so I will elaborate
a little bit about this.

1292
00:57:54,337 --> 00:57:56,673
This is a picture I got
from a friend of mine,

1293
00:57:56,673 --> 00:57:59,676
eh, at, em,
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

1294
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:03,313
It tells about Flight Control, An Evolution of Automation

1295
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,748
to Enable Greater
Air Vehicle Capability.

1296
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:08,284
And you see what they're
striving for

1297
00:58:08,284 --> 00:58:11,855
is that they are striving for
a higher degree of autonomy.

1298
00:58:11,855 --> 00:58:14,123
So they would like to have, y'know, vehicles that are

1299
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:16,125
much more autonomous
than they are before.

1300
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:18,628
The same thing is happening
out there in space.

1301
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:23,933
And, um, em, adaptive control can play a small part of this

1302
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:26,536
but we have to bring in
elements of learning

1303
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:27,871
and cognition in here

1304
00:58:27,871 --> 00:58:30,073
which are,
not so easy to do

1305
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:32,075
if you're going
to do it autonomously.

1306
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:35,144
There have been
some interesting

1307
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:36,246
things done, though.

1308
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:38,848
Most of you have probably heard
about the Darpa Urban Challenge.

1309
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:40,350
Y'know, when you drive car

1310
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,485
on an air force bay
out in California,

1311
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:45,255
they should obey the California driving rules.

1312
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:46,556
And th-you mix them up

1313
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:48,725
with other cars
that are driving around.

1314
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:51,327
And, eh, there were a handful
of cars,

1315
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:52,762
who were

1316
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:54,764
fulfilling of the specification.

1317
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:58,001
Um, among them was this car
here that was the winning car.

1318
00:58:58,001 --> 00:58:59,235
And they have some elements

1319
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:00,937
of adaptation, learning,
and connection.

1320
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:02,272
They have to have
a lot of safety.

1321
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:04,207
They have to have diagnostics.

1322
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,209
If you're going to have
real systems,

1323
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:09,312
you also have to think about maintenance and reconfiguration.

1324
00:59:09,312 --> 00:59:14,284
I should mention, though,
at that already 1995,

1325
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:16,853
y'know, that's long time ago,

1326
00:59:16,853 --> 00:59:18,354
17 years ago,

1327
00:59:18,354 --> 00:59:20,556
a German researcher
named Dickmanns

1328
00:59:20,556 --> 00:59:24,427
was running a Mercedes Benz
from Munich to Copenhagen

1329
00:59:24,427 --> 00:59:26,562
on the German Autobahn

1330
00:59:26,562 --> 00:59:29,499
and, eh, they had an autonomous car with a lot of sensors on it.

1331
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:31,734
And of course the driver on the
Autobahn, they had to sit there

1332
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:33,436
and also supervise it manually.

1333
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:36,806
And they recorded whenever they
have to do manual interaction.

1334
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:42,278
But they could run 95%
autonomously already in 1995,

1335
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:43,880
which I think is
quite remarkable.

1336
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:50,954
Eh, so my feeling is that, eh, and this is very subjective,

1337
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:53,756
that I think we are
moving into third phase.

1338
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:56,659
Like I said, the second phase
was driven by the space race

1339
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:58,094
and by computers.

1340
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:00,596
Now we're driven by complex
networked systems

1341
01:00:00,596 --> 01:00:03,266
and applications in physics
and biology.

1342
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,234
So these are some
very strong drivers.

1343
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:07,270
And, eh, some things
we have to have there.

1344
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,671
We have to have autonomy.

1345
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:10,273
We have to learn
to deal with sensor

1346
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,808
and actuator rich systems.

1347
01:00:11,808 --> 01:00:12,809
We have to learn how to do

1348
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:15,979
provable safe design
and reconfiguration.

1349
01:00:15,979 --> 01:00:17,981
Now when you have the cars
with a lot of computers in,

1350
01:00:17,981 --> 01:00:18,982
when you drive them in

1351
01:00:18,982 --> 01:00:21,517
and you have to make a change
of them, something,

1352
01:00:21,517 --> 01:00:22,652
you must have a safe way

1353
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:25,888
to introduce changes
in the system effectively.

1354
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:28,958
And I also think as control
engineers what we have to do

1355
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:32,328
is that we have to recover
the holistic view.

1356
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:35,531
Eh, I think what happened in
the 60s wasn't necessary

1357
01:00:35,531 --> 01:00:37,533
because if you're going to develop, y'know,

1358
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:38,668
new areas and new field,

1359
01:00:38,668 --> 01:00:40,937
there is no way
but to dive into it,

1360
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:42,372
y'know, forget about the rest.

1361
01:00:42,372 --> 01:00:44,774
Dive into it an-and develop
the mathematics.

1362
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:46,876
And we still have to do this
in many of this field,

1363
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:49,612
but to serve the engineering world that's sitting out there,

1364
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:52,715
we must also have people who have a holistic view of things

1365
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:54,083
and that's a major challenge

1366
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:56,419
that I will talk
a little bit about.

1367
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:59,555
And, eh, if you take this NIH study, The Engineer of 2020,

1368
01:00:59,555 --> 01:01:02,025
this is precisely
what they are saying.

1369
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:05,995
That, eh, contemporary challenges, er,

1370
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:08,297
require a systems perspective.

1371
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:10,933
So we must make sure that we're
getting students

1372
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:12,835
with a broad
systems perspective.

1373
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:14,337
I'm very pleased to see
John Barris here.

1374
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:19,008
So, uh, he's been advocating this for a very long time.

1375
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:22,211
In my view it is
something like this.

1376
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:24,213
I'm pretentious enough to
put control in the middle.

1377
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:25,181
Doesn't matter
what you put it.

1378
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:26,716
[laughing]

1379
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:28,718
Eh, then we have
to have computing.

1380
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:29,886
We have to have communication.

1381
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:31,054
We have to mathematics.

1382
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:33,156
And out here we
have the real world.

1383
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:35,124
And to do the system we're
talking about

1384
01:01:35,124 --> 01:01:37,460
you must in some way grasp

1385
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:38,528
aspects of all of this.

1386
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:41,564
Now, it's impossible
for a single person

1387
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:42,865
to be good at all of this.

1388
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:44,033
But what we can do

1389
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:46,569
is I'm sure we can
educate, eh, students

1390
01:01:46,569 --> 01:01:49,005
who are very good at
one of these fields

1391
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:52,508
and who know enough about
these interfaces in here

1392
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:55,445
so that they can communicate
and work effectively

1393
01:01:55,445 --> 01:01:57,547
with the other specialists
that are sitting here.

1394
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:58,314
And then, of course,

1395
01:01:58,314 --> 01:02:01,617
we need to have some
overall people in here.

1396
01:02:01,617 --> 01:02:03,152
Em, eh, eh, I talk about some,

1397
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:06,422
for example, I think this, this interface is real easy,

1398
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:07,657
control and communication,

1399
01:02:07,657 --> 01:02:10,793
because in my mind it's essentially the same stuff.

1400
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:14,297
But it's taught in different
departments by different people,

1401
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:16,265
which I think is ridiculous.

1402
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:18,067
Eh, Mathematics is the same.

1403
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:20,069
There is a couple
of differences.

1404
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:22,071
Communication, the guys don't bother about time delays

1405
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:24,073
and we control guys
are worried about time delays.

1406
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:26,075
But I think these
are minor things.

1407
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:27,343
So I think we can do a lot

1408
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:29,345
both in terms of courses
and other things

1409
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:31,647
t-to merge these kinds
of things together.

1410
01:02:31,647 --> 01:02:34,117
Eh, I'm gonna talk a little
more about s-something.

1411
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:35,418
This is the easy interface.

1412
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,653
It only has to do with
university politics.

1413
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:40,022
[laughing]

1414
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:42,558
But now you have a young,
vigorous chancellor here,

1415
01:02:42,558 --> 01:02:46,462
so, I think, uh, you may have
a chance to do something.

1416
01:02:46,462 --> 01:02:50,733
Eh, I will talk about the
computer science barrier.

1417
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:53,369
Y'know, here you have control
and here you have computing.

1418
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:55,838
Incidentally, I borrowed this
from Bruce Krogh at,

1419
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:57,173
eh, Carnegie Mellon.

1420
01:02:57,173 --> 01:02:58,474
So what control engineers do,

1421
01:02:58,474 --> 01:03:00,042
they work with
stability feedback,

1422
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:01,978
ordinary differential equation, moderate complexity,

1423
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:03,513
and worry about robustness.

1424
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:05,515
And then they write a-a Simulink simulation.

1425
01:03:05,515 --> 01:03:07,517
They throw this over
to the computing guys.

1426
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:09,152
And they know about
languages, etc,

1427
01:03:09,152 --> 01:03:11,521
formal methods,
abstraction, architecture.

1428
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:13,523
And then they take the
simulating program

1429
01:03:13,523 --> 01:03:15,858
and then they do some kind
of software for it.

1430
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:17,793
And, eh, sometimes it works.

1431
01:03:17,793 --> 01:03:19,162
Sometimes it doesn't work.

1432
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:20,163
So what's happening here,

1433
01:03:20,163 --> 01:03:21,864
control engineers have to know

1434
01:03:21,864 --> 01:03:23,866
a little bit more
about computing.

1435
01:03:23,866 --> 01:03:25,868
Computing engineers have
to know more about control.

1436
01:03:25,868 --> 01:03:27,136
I'll give you one example.

1437
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:30,239
In automotive now there is a
communications device

1438
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:33,709
called the can bus which is a standard communication

1439
01:03:33,709 --> 01:03:35,044
protocol in the cars.

1440
01:03:35,044 --> 01:03:37,046
It's a beautiful
little protocol,

1441
01:03:37,046 --> 01:03:38,614
but it has one drawback.

1442
01:03:38,614 --> 01:03:40,650
It has time delays,
and not only that,

1443
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:43,085
it has very big time delays.

1444
01:03:43,085 --> 01:03:46,022
And if I said that time delays
are bad for control system,

1445
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:48,024
very big time delays
are really bad.

1446
01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:49,859
So if this person who did
the can bus

1447
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:51,861
had had a good introductory course in control,

1448
01:03:51,861 --> 01:03:53,696
I said just an introductory course in control,

1449
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:54,697
that was good.

1450
01:03:54,697 --> 01:03:56,199
He would have known,

1451
01:03:56,199 --> 01:03:57,366
time delays are bad.

1452
01:03:57,366 --> 01:03:59,035
So this would not be.
a good thing

1453
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:00,436
if you're gonna close
control loops.

1454
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:01,837
It's alright
if you're gonna just

1455
01:04:01,837 --> 01:04:03,306
raise your windows up and down,

1456
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:04,307
but if you're going to close

1457
01:04:04,307 --> 01:04:06,976
control feedback loops around there, it's not a good idea.

1458
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:08,344
So that's one example,

1459
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:12,415
that could have been
prohibited by good education.

1460
01:04:12,415 --> 01:04:13,382
[laughing]

1461
01:04:13,382 --> 01:04:15,685
I should also mention computing.

1462
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:16,752
And I still remember,

1463
01:04:16,752 --> 01:04:18,888
eh, well you can start with Vannevar Bush.

1464
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:21,157
He said, "Engineering can
progress no faster

1465
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:23,159
"than mathematical analysis
on which it's based.

1466
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:25,861
"Formal mathematics
is frequently inadequate.

1467
01:04:25,861 --> 01:04:28,464
"A mechanical solution offers the most promise."

1468
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:30,466
He was at MIT and then
he went ahead and built

1469
01:04:30,466 --> 01:04:32,468
The Mechanical
Differential Analyzer,

1470
01:04:32,468 --> 01:04:36,906
that could solve about six ordinary differential equations.

1471
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:38,741
I worked for IBM research,
and my boss,

1472
01:04:38,741 --> 01:04:40,343
I was in the math department
for a while,

1473
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:42,245
my boss was Herman Goldstine.

1474
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:44,614
He built the first computer
together with John von Neumann.

1475
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:46,349
So, he was chair
in the math department.

1476
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:47,683
At one staff meeting
he said this,

1477
01:04:47,683 --> 01:04:48,718
which I've never forgotten.

1478
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:51,587
"When things change
by two orders of magnitude

1479
01:04:51,587 --> 01:04:53,990
"it is not evolution,
it is revolution."

1480
01:04:55,191 --> 01:04:56,692
Now you combine this
with Moore's Law,

1481
01:04:56,692 --> 01:04:58,361
you get a revolution
every ten years.

1482
01:04:58,361 --> 01:04:59,462
[laughing]

1483
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:01,464
So, you recognize that
computing power

1484
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:03,966
changes by two orders
of magnitude roughly speaking

1485
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:04,800
every ten years.

1486
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,602
And that's why I have to
exchange laptops

1487
01:05:06,602 --> 01:05:08,471
every third year, for example.

1488
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:10,306
And, eh, there's a
tremendous potential.

1489
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:11,474
If you think about this, y'know,

1490
01:05:11,474 --> 01:05:14,910
that you're gaining two orders of magnitude per ten years,

1491
01:05:14,910 --> 01:05:16,912
so there's
a f-fantastic potential.

1492
01:05:16,912 --> 01:05:19,949
But we have not been able
to capitalize on this

1493
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:21,384
in engineering productivity.

1494
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:25,488
And I think that is something
to think about

1495
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:27,490
because there is
something out there

1496
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:28,591
that we could probably do something about.

1497
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:33,095
I should also mention that what I call the physics barrier,

1498
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:33,863
y'know.

1499
01:05:33,863 --> 01:05:35,498
Here is, we have the real world.

1500
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:37,767
And there we have
mass, energy, momentum

1501
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,368
and up here we have control.

1502
01:05:39,368 --> 01:05:41,570
And I said before
that block diagrams

1503
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:43,673
is very useful for control

1504
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:48,144
because that was what w-people used to discover that autopilots

1505
01:05:48,144 --> 01:05:49,679
was the same as process control.

1506
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:51,681
The block diagrams
look the same.

1507
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:54,350
But we as control engineers have
been brainwashing students

1508
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:57,920
with block diagrams,
over 50 years,

1509
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,122
but, and we use them
for physical modeling,

1510
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:03,392
but block diagrams are absolutely worthless

1511
01:06:03,392 --> 01:06:05,561
for phy-serious
physical modeling

1512
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:07,563
because in blocks you have a causal connection.

1513
01:06:07,563 --> 01:06:09,231
You have an input
and you have an output.

1514
01:06:09,231 --> 01:06:11,567
When it connect
two physical systems

1515
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:13,602
you have
bidirectional interaction

1516
01:06:13,602 --> 01:06:15,604
and that is not captured
by block diagrams.

1517
01:06:15,604 --> 01:06:18,741
So, so please,

1518
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:20,476
if you're educate
in control engineer

1519
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:23,045
say that there's something more than block diagrams, okay?

1520
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:26,949
Eh,then I'll talk about
modeling and simulation.

1521
01:06:26,949 --> 01:06:29,151
Again, a quote from this,
The Engineer of 2020

1522
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:30,586
where they say that

1523
01:06:30,586 --> 01:06:34,457
"computer-based design-build
engineerer will become the norm

1524
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:36,125
"for most product designs,

1525
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:38,527
"accelerating the creation
of complex structure

1526
01:06:38,527 --> 01:06:41,897
"for which multiple subsystems combine to form a product."

1527
01:06:41,897 --> 01:06:44,667
So in other words, y'know, modeling is simulation.

1528
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,268
And so this is not my world.

1529
01:06:46,268 --> 01:06:47,536
I said, most were personal.

1530
01:06:47,536 --> 01:06:50,673
This is from a more
authoritative source than me.

1531
01:06:52,007 --> 01:06:53,509
I'll give you a nice
example of this.

1532
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:58,114
Eh, the major German
car manufacturers,

1533
01:06:58,114 --> 01:06:59,749
I listed them here,

1534
01:06:59,749 --> 01:07:01,951
and their suppliers,

1535
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:04,353
have standardized
when it comes to doing

1536
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:06,055
climate control systems in cars.

1537
01:07:06,055 --> 01:07:09,091
You know climate control, it has, um, compressors,

1538
01:07:09,091 --> 01:07:11,627
it has heating changes,
it has pumps, etc.

1539
01:07:11,627 --> 01:07:14,130
And what they have done,
is that the supplier,

1540
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:16,365
who supplies a hardware piece
of hardware,

1541
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:20,369
he also delivers a validated mathematical model of that.

1542
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:22,304
Happens to be in a
language called Modelica.

1543
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:28,644
And then the car companies,
they are taking then this model,

1544
01:07:28,644 --> 01:07:30,980
eh, so they say, well,
uh, maybe this

1545
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:33,516
p-company here has a cheaper version of a compressor,

1546
01:07:33,516 --> 01:07:34,450
should I use it?

1547
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:37,153
So then they take the-the model from-from this company,

1548
01:07:37,153 --> 01:07:40,856
they put it into their simulator and they run the typical, eh,

1549
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:42,825
European standard drive cycle

1550
01:07:42,825 --> 01:07:45,628
and then they figure out what happens to power consumption,

1551
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:48,364
to gasoline consumption,
what happens to quality,

1552
01:07:48,364 --> 01:07:48,998
no big deal,

1553
01:07:48,998 --> 01:07:50,666
so then we can buy
the cheaper one.

1554
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:53,736
So I think this is a very nice
illustration of, em,

1555
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:55,271
how you can use models.

1556
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:56,705
In this case,

1557
01:07:56,705 --> 01:08:00,209
the IP is protected by
extensive en-en-encryptation

1558
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:03,512
and the substantial reduction here is in-in road

1559
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:05,681
and climate chamber testing.

1560
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:07,683
And I'm very proud to say that
this was done by,

1561
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:09,852
eh, some of my grad students

1562
01:08:09,852 --> 01:08:12,188
who also have this company Modelon, who is doing this.

1563
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:16,325
Eh, actually the same technology was used by Toyota

1564
01:08:16,325 --> 01:08:17,426
when they made the Prius.

1565
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:19,495
And the software
was also done

1566
01:08:19,495 --> 01:08:21,597
by one of my former
PhD students.

1567
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:24,333
Toyota had, at the time,
300 engineers working with

1568
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:26,902
mo-with working with
what's now called Modelica.

1569
01:08:28,404 --> 01:08:30,873
Ok, now come to
the educational challenges.

1570
01:08:30,873 --> 01:08:33,709
Eh, we have to educate the engineers who can deal with this

1571
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:34,810
in the future.

1572
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:38,647
We also have to educate
people in physics and biology.

1573
01:08:38,647 --> 01:08:41,383
And last year I actually gave
a course in control

1574
01:08:41,383 --> 01:08:42,585
to physicists,

1575
01:08:42,585 --> 01:08:44,653
based on the request from
the physics department,

1576
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:46,655
which was kind of fun.

1577
01:08:46,655 --> 01:08:51,293
Em, and I think in control we have, what I call the dilemma

1578
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:53,095
of emerging fields.

1579
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:55,498
Y'know, I said control
is a very young field,

1580
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:56,599
literal 50 years.

1581
01:08:56,599 --> 01:08:58,234
So what did we do?

1582
01:08:58,234 --> 01:09:00,236
Well, we taught
everything we knew.

1583
01:09:00,236 --> 01:09:02,238
That was, first course.

1584
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:05,040
When we knew a little bit more, we made a new course.

1585
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,042
And then we made a new course,
and we made a new course,

1586
01:09:07,042 --> 01:09:08,043
and we made a new course.

1587
01:09:08,043 --> 01:09:11,580
And right now there are
simply too many courses,

1588
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:13,115
eh, because if we're going
to have these people

1589
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:15,251
who are well rounded
and well educated

1590
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:17,620
we can't have them to do 15 courses in control or,

1591
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,822
I don't know what it is here,
to get a PhD in Urbana.

1592
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:21,257
We can't have them to, because,

1593
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:23,859
they also have to learn a little bit about communication,

1594
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:27,162
about computer science,
and about, about physics.

1595
01:09:27,162 --> 01:09:28,764
So we have to do
something about this.

1596
01:09:28,764 --> 01:09:29,965
And the way to do this,
I think,

1597
01:09:29,965 --> 01:09:31,901
is to filter out
the fundamentals,

1598
01:09:31,901 --> 01:09:34,470
to compress, eh, to compress,

1599
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:37,339
figure out, what are really
the important things?

1600
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:38,407
What are the essentials here?

1601
01:09:38,407 --> 01:09:40,809
And we have to do this at
the courses to all the level.

1602
01:09:40,809 --> 01:09:41,844
It's a lot of work.

1603
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:43,846
Particularly if you have
your courses developed

1604
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:44,847
and are going to teach it.

1605
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:47,950
But I think in the long run it's
going to be very worthwhile.

1606
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:50,286
I also mentioned here computing.

1607
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:52,288
And I think computers
have changed

1608
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:53,989
what we mean by
a solution to a problem.

1609
01:09:53,989 --> 01:09:55,491
Y'know, in the old time
you had a solution

1610
01:09:55,491 --> 01:09:57,326
if you can write it down
with sine functions

1611
01:09:57,326 --> 01:09:58,427
or something like this.

1612
01:09:58,427 --> 01:09:59,828
And now, t-for example,

1613
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:03,766
if something reduces to a-a linear algebra problem,

1614
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:05,067
it's essentially solved.

1615
01:10:05,067 --> 01:10:06,569
If something reduces to an

1616
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:09,171
ordinary differential equation with constant coefficient,

1617
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:10,306
it's also solved because

1618
01:10:10,306 --> 01:10:12,775
we can generate everything
we know with computers.

1619
01:10:12,775 --> 01:10:15,644
So I think, erh, by thinking
intelligent about this,

1620
01:10:15,644 --> 01:10:17,079
I think we can do this.

1621
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:18,847
And what we need is,
that we have to have students

1622
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:21,216
who have very deep knowledge
in specific areas

1623
01:10:21,216 --> 01:10:23,953
but who are reasonably broad
in neighboring areas

1624
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:26,956
and also, who are able
to communicate

1625
01:10:26,956 --> 01:10:29,358
and also, to work in teams.

1626
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:31,360
This is what we need
in order to do this.

1627
01:10:33,028 --> 01:10:34,697
So now, eh, what I've done,

1628
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:37,533
I've spoken about introduction, past, present, and future.

1629
01:10:37,533 --> 01:10:39,668
And now let me try to summarize.

1630
01:10:39,668 --> 01:10:44,239
Eh, I think, personally, control
is a very vital dynamic field.

1631
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:47,409
And if we watch out
for the foundations

1632
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:50,779
and if we think about telling other people what we are doing,

1633
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:53,782
eh, I think we are going
to continue to do great.

1634
01:10:53,782 --> 01:10:55,117
Eh, there are lots
of applications

1635
01:10:55,117 --> 01:10:56,218
in traditional fields,

1636
01:10:56,218 --> 01:10:57,786
so engineers we're
educating here,

1637
01:10:57,786 --> 01:11:00,489
they can find lots of job
out in the industry.

1638
01:11:00,489 --> 01:11:03,225
Now we have, also have to deal with networked embedded systems.

1639
01:11:03,225 --> 01:11:05,227
We have to deal with
autonomy and safety.

1640
01:11:05,227 --> 01:11:06,261
And I think we should take

1641
01:11:06,261 --> 01:11:08,731
the educational challenge
here seriously.

1642
01:11:08,731 --> 01:11:10,733
We were discussing here during
dinner, for example,

1643
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:13,902
that there are many changing modes of education right now

1644
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:16,672
and I think this may be some vehicle we can jump on

1645
01:11:16,672 --> 01:11:18,574
to, to do this.

1646
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:21,010
Eh, so, what we should do,

1647
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:23,679
is that we should continue to take care of the foundations

1648
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:25,681
and then to develop
the holistic view.

1649
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:29,084
If we do this, control will
also be great in the future.

1650
01:11:29,084 --> 01:11:30,285
Thank you very much.

1651
01:11:30,285 --> 01:11:41,864
[applause]

1652
01:11:41,864 --> 01:11:43,065
(man)
Thank you, Karl,

1653
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:46,835
for this inspiring, eh, lecture.

1654
01:11:46,835 --> 01:11:51,373
I think we can take, eh, eh,
a couple of questions

1655
01:11:51,373 --> 01:11:52,408
from the audience.

1656
01:12:03,318 --> 01:12:04,920
When you have a big crowd it's

1657
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,488
(Karl)
They are like Swedish students.

1658
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:08,824
(man)
Yes, that's right.

1659
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:09,258
Yes.

1660
01:12:09,258 --> 01:12:10,426
(Karl)
John, John Barras

1661
01:12:12,327 --> 01:12:33,148
(inaudible audience)

1662
01:12:33,148 --> 01:12:34,516
(Karl)
Ah, eh, co-could you,

1663
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:36,452
could you repeat, eh,
they wanted

1664
01:12:36,452 --> 01:12:41,690
(inaudible audience)

1665
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:42,357
(Karl)
Yeah

1666
01:12:42,357 --> 01:13:06,815
(inaudible audience)

1667
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:07,649
(Karl)
I-I will repeat,

1668
01:13:07,649 --> 01:13:08,984
I will repeat the question.

1669
01:13:08,984 --> 01:13:11,220
Eh, t-the question was that

1670
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,756
before we had
a very simple situation.

1671
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:16,892
We had the sensor
and an actuator

1672
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:19,027
and then we had the controller sitting between

1673
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:22,397
and maybe you had ten sensors and ten actuators,

1674
01:13:22,397 --> 01:13:24,433
but you have a block sitting there in between.

1675
01:13:24,433 --> 01:13:27,035
And John asked, what is happening right now

1676
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:28,537
when we have networked systems.

1677
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:29,538
And I'm trying here,

1678
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:33,108
to pick up a little picture,
as an illustration.

1679
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:34,476
Eh, ah,

1680
01:13:37,346 --> 01:13:38,480
Eh, I'll do it here.

1681
01:13:40,482 --> 01:13:41,617
Eh, it should be,

1682
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:46,889
uh, I think it was
somewhere down here.

1683
01:13:50,025 --> 01:13:51,593
Oh, I think I'll skip
the picture.

1684
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:54,363
Eh, I think this will require

1685
01:13:55,631 --> 01:13:56,365
new paradigms.

1686
01:13:56,365 --> 01:13:57,699
I mean, will we require, y'know.

1687
01:13:57,699 --> 01:13:59,034
My view is this.

1688
01:13:59,034 --> 01:14:00,302
That I think it will
requi-require

1689
01:14:00,302 --> 01:14:02,905
total different way
of thinking.

1690
01:14:02,905 --> 01:14:06,642
So, so what you have to do is that you have, eh, eh,

1691
01:14:06,642 --> 01:14:11,180
you have to have a lot of, eh, eh-eh, well, to be honest,

1692
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:13,182
I don't really know
what the solution is,

1693
01:14:13,182 --> 01:14:15,918
but clearly it requires a very different way of thinking

1694
01:14:15,918 --> 01:14:19,087
than when you had, for example, ten sensors and ten actuators

1695
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:21,757
and then, y'know, some kind of computing box in the middle.

1696
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:24,193
So, so that's why I'm saying,
y'know, that

1697
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:25,661
control is by no means dead, y'know.

1698
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:27,996
We have these problems,
that are very challenging,

1699
01:14:27,996 --> 01:14:30,165
which are sitting out there that we have to deal with

1700
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:31,500
where we don't know
the solution.

1701
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:32,434
And that's, of course, great

1702
01:14:32,434 --> 01:14:35,037
if your graduate student are looking for good problems.

1703
01:14:35,037 --> 01:14:36,438
And it's not going to be easy.

1704
01:14:36,438 --> 01:14:43,779
(inaudible audience)

1705
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:45,147
(Karl)
Yeah.

1706
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:48,851
Uh, so, eh, th-the comment was that, eh, eh,

1707
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:50,519
if you, if you have
information theory,

1708
01:14:50,519 --> 01:14:51,353
you have the problem

1709
01:14:51,353 --> 01:14:53,188
bringing the information out
to the network.

1710
01:14:53,188 --> 01:14:54,857
So, tha-that's also a problem.

1711
01:14:54,857 --> 01:14:56,191
So,

1712
01:14:56,191 --> 01:14:57,125
yes.

1713
01:14:57,125 --> 01:14:58,627
I think, you know, eh,

1714
01:14:58,627 --> 01:15:00,863
Both John and I
will be out here,

1715
