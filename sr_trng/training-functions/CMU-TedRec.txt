are you going
then on out i buy them and how are we homo sapiens we are doing is a species
i took away the answer that question is this
you choose some measure of human physical well being
and longevity average calories per day average income overall population that's that
and draw graph of its value over time
in almost every case you get the same result
the winds gators along in low-level for millennia and rockets up exponentially in the nineteenth and twentieth century
or she is a measure of consumption
consumption of energy consumption for far as i
and draw grass and its value over time
in the same way the lines there is a long been a low level for millennia and rockets are exponentially in the nineteenth and twentieth century
biologists award for this outbreak
an outbreak is on population species the seeds of bounds in memphis life
but what you ordinarily keeps populations of species within roughly five minutes
s. parasites lack of resources prevent them from expanding too much
but every now and then the species the states it's pounds
from one starfish in the indian ocean zebra mussels the great whites spurs but we're here in canada
ah who's low hundred four thousand four million people
so here is a fundamental lesson from biology outbreaks in nature don't end well
