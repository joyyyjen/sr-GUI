<s> we are kicking off this evening a week long celebration of a landmark event which is the golden anniversary of the allerton conference on communication control and computing </s> (1)
<s> for those of you who have been regular attendees at the allerton conference for many years and for some probably allerton is special place in your career having presented your first paper or second paper in your career at the allerton conference and i know that there are many of you out there </s> (2)
<s> for those of you for whom this is the very first allerton conference an and for all conference attendees and for our guests this is a historic moment </s> (3)
<s> its a celebration of a multi disciplinary scientific meeting which was launched fifty years ago on november fifteen nineteen sixty three with vision and incredible foresight </s> (4)
<s> it was the brainchild of mac van valkenburg who together with joe cruz co chaired the first conference fifty years ago </s> (5)
<s> bill perkins eh who is here ehht and eh he was also involved in the initial discussions and planning of the conference and i believe he is the only one in this room who has witnessed that historic event fifty years ago </s> (6)
<s> the creatives vision was as articulated by mac and joe in the forward to the proceedings of that first conference </s> (7)
<s> that vision was to provide an opportunity for researchers to present their fresh new results in a dynamic growing field and to bring researchers in different disciplines together to cultivate cross fertilization of ideas </s> (8)
<s> and this was right on target </s> (9)
<s> and this far reaching vision of its founders is still the guiding light at allerton fifty years later </s> (10)
<s> its its one of the longest running conferences at least that im aware of in the systems area and its one of the most prestigious </s> (11)
<s> its perhaps the only longest running conference that has never changed its venue </s> (12)
<s> from the very beginning it has been held at the allerton house in monticello illinois </s> (13)
<s> only a minor adjustment was made in going from the first to the second allerton conference in nineteen sixty four which was to move the date from the chilly mid november to late september which was september twenty eighth through the thirtieth </s> (14)
<s> thats when the the second allerton conference was held so that the attendees can enjoy the beautiful fall weather at the allerton grounds and it looks like at least some of the days well have that beautiful weather with us this year also </s> (15)
<s> im told eh im not sure to what extent that it is a fact but eh mac actually wanted to hold the first eh conference in october the first week in october because that coincided would have coincided with his birth date which was october fifth </s> (16)
<s> but the allerton house was not available at the time and im told that was the reason why it was pushed to november the fifteenth </s> (17)
<s> but then immediately the following year it was brought back to the first week or the last week in september and since then it has always been held either the last week in september or the first week in october </s> (18)
<s> the conference has evolved over the years in parallel to the developments in the fields of communication control and computing and in fact it has at times influenced impacted and shaped the evolutions in those fields </s> (19)
<s> some of the very early results which then became landmarks in these fields were presented at the allerton conference </s> (20)
<s> to share with you some numbers in nineteen sixty three at the very first conference there were eleven technical sessions three general or what we now call plenary sessions they were not called that way at the time with sixty two individual presentations involving eighty four authors </s> (21)
<s> the proceedings of that inaugural meeting was edited by joe cruz and it comprised seven hundred and eighty pages </s> (22)
<s> and here i have actually a copy of that very first proceedings and it is in such good shape fifty years later </s> (23)
<s> [laughing] and the and the proceedings in the intervening years have always looked like this </s> (24)
<s> nothing has changed </s> (25)
<s> and the eh today as compared with those initial numbers forty nine years later we have in the program this week sixty five sessions three hundred and forty four individual presentations and have almost five hundred authors maybe even over five hundred authors are involved in these papers which will be presented here </s> (26)
<s> so its a its a major growth but we are limited by the size of the allerton house so dont expect those numbers to grow to double within the next even uh ten years </s> (27)
<s> so talking about the celebrations this eh golden anniversary of the allerton conference is not the only important anniversary on our campus today </s> (28)
<s> today is also the exact to the day first year anniversary of our chancellor phyllis wise taking on the stewardship of our campus </s> (29)

<s> yknow um when i got this position i tried really hard to uh do a lot of homework on the university of illinois to learn about my new academic home and i must admit i did not come across the allerton conference so i must not have done homework enough to realize what a rich tradition was really started fifty years ago </s> (41)
<s> um this conference really is an illustration of uh what can happen at a great university with a one hundred and forty five year history </s> (42)
<s> uh the the story that you just told professor baser basar and uh what im learning tonight about all of this is truly amazing </s> (43)
<s> i think its wonderful that it started out at allerton and it continues to be at allerton </s> (44)
<s> i think its wonderful to know that sometimes traditions should be carried on because they hav are part of the richness of the experience </s> (45)
<s> um you know i i just want to add tonight that uh im sure that this is the beginning of the next fifty years of this conference and though it wont get larger in terms of number that that is actually a good thing because sometimes the intimacy that you gather from having only a few hundred people cannot be replicated when you let it grow into thousands and thousands of people at the same time </s> (46)
<s> so i wish you the very best in this conference </s> (47)
<s> i am honored to be here to welcome you to it and i wish you the richest of ca discussions and and um new discoveries being discussed here </s> (48)
