um you know i i just want to add tonight that uh im sure that this is the beginning of the next 50 years of this conference and though it wont get larger in terms of number that that is actually a good thing because sometimes the intimacy that you gather from having only a few hundred people cannot be replicated when you let it grow into thousands and thousands of people at the same time

for example the ieee control systems society has published a book called the impact of control technology which is available on the web and in connection with the year eh two eh 2000 there were a couple of books presented that gave a perspective of engineering and control uh in this century and i listed a few of them there and well come back to them later

and i didnt dare to go f more than to roughly 1980 because one of my colleagues who was a professor of history said never ever talk about recent things because youll never have a good perspective on them so i was brave when i went to 1980

and i would say that the systems we have now in control they can easily deal with say 20 100 variables 20 100 variables can deal with well
and i would say that the systems we have now in control they can easily deal with say twenty one hundred variables twenty one hundred variables can deal with well

i should mention though at that already 1995 yknow thats long time ago 17 years ago a german researcher named dickmanns was running a mercedes benz from munich to copenhagen on the german autobahn and eh they had an autonomous car with a lot of sensors on it
i should mention though at that already nineteen ninety five yknow thats long time ago seventeen years ago a german researcher named dickmanns was running a mercedes benz from munich to copenhagen on the german autobahn and eh they had an autonomous car with a lot of sensors on it

but they could run 95 autonomously already in 1995 which i think is quite remarkable
but they could run ninety five autonomously already in nineteen ninety five which i think is quite remarkable

eh i think what happened in the 60s wasnt necessary because if youre going to develop yknow new areas and new field there is no way but to dive into it yknow forget about the rest
eh i think what happened in the sixty wasnt necessary because if youre going to develop yknow new areas and new field there is no way but to dive into it yknow forget about the rest

and eh if you take this nih study the engineer of 2020 this is precisely what they are saying

but we as control engineers have been brainwashing students with block diagrams over 50 years but and we use them for physical modeling but block diagrams are absolutely worthless for phy serious physical modeling because in blocks you have a causal connection

again a quote from this the engineer of 2020 where they say that computer based design build engineerer will become the norm for most product designs accelerating the creation of complex structure for which multiple subsystems combine to form a product so in other words yknow modeling is simulation

toyota had at the time 300 engineers working with mo with working with whats now called modelica

yknow i said control is a very young field literal 50 years
yknow i said control is a very young field literal fifty years

and right now there are simply too many courses eh because if were going to have these people who are well rounded and well educated we cant have them to do 15 courses in control or i dont know what it is here to get a phd in urbana
