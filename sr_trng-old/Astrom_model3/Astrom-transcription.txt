we are kicking off this evening a week long celebration of a landmark event which is the golden anniversary of the allerton conference on communication control and computing
for those of you who have been regular attendees at the allerton conference for many years and for some probably allerton is special place in your career having presented your first paper or second paper in your career at the allerton conference and i know that there are many of you out there
for those of you for whom this is the very first allerton conference an and for all conference attendees and for our guests this is a historic moment
its a celebration of a multi disciplinary scientific meeting which was launched fifty years ago on november fifteen nineteen sixty three with vision and incredible foresight
it was the brainchild of mac van valkenburg who together with joe cruz co chaired the first conference fifty years ago
bill perkins eh who is here ehht and eh he was also involved in the initial discussions and planning of the conference and i believe he is the only one in this room who has witnessed that historic event fifty years ago
the creatives vision was as articulated by mac and joe in the forward to the proceedings of that first conference
that vision was to provide an opportunity for researchers to present their fresh new results in a dynamic growing field and to bring researchers in different disciplines together to cultivate cross fertilization of ideas
and this was right on target
and this far reaching vision of its founders is still the guiding light at allerton fifty years later
its its one of the longest running conferences at least that im aware of in the systems area and its one of the most prestigious
its perhaps the only longest running conference that has never changed its venue
from the very beginning it has been held at the allerton house in monticello illinois
only a minor adjustment was made in going from the first to the second allerton conference in nineteen sixty four which was to move the date from the chilly mid november to late september which was september twenty eighth through the thirtieth
thats when the the second allerton conference was held so that the attendees can enjoy the beautiful fall weather at the allerton grounds and it looks like at least some of the days well have that beautiful weather with us this year also
im told eh im not sure to what extent that it is a fact but eh mac actually wanted to hold the first eh conference in october the first week in october because that coincided would have coincided with his birth date which was october fifth
but the allerton house was not available at the time and im told that was the reason why it was pushed to november the fifteenth
but then immediately the following year it was brought back to the first week or the last week in september and since then it has always been held either the last week in september or the first week in october
the conference has evolved over the years in parallel to the developments in the fields of communication control and computing and in fact it has at times influenced impacted and shaped the evolutions in those fields
some of the very early results which then became landmarks in these fields were presented at the allerton conference
to share with you some numbers in nineteen sixty three at the very first conference there were eleven technical sessions three general or what we now call plenary sessions they were not called that way at the time with sixty two individual presentations involving eighty four authors
the proceedings of that inaugural meeting was edited by joe cruz and it comprised seven hundred and eighty pages
and here i have actually a copy of that very first proceedings and it is in such good shape fifty years later
[laughing] and the and the proceedings in the intervening years have always looked like this
nothing has changed
and the eh today as compared with those initial numbers forty nine years later we have in the program this week sixty five sessions three hundred and forty four individual presentations and have almost five hundred authors maybe even over five hundred authors are involved in these papers which will be presented here
so its a its a major growth but we are limited by the size of the allerton house so dont expect those numbers to grow to double within the next even uh ten years
so talking about the celebrations this eh golden anniversary of the allerton conference is not the only important anniversary on our campus today
today is also the exact to the day first year anniversary of our chancellor phyllis wise taking on the stewardship of our campus
we are delighted and honored to have her here with us this evening to share with us this important moment and to officially open this kick off event for the golden anniversary
chancellor wise also holds the position of vice president of the university of illinois and as ceo of our campus she is responsible for all financial programs campus policies and priorities with the mission of insuring a transformative educational experience for americas next generation of leaders
she has held eh faculty and administrative appointments at the university of washington at the university of california at davis and kentucky eh prior to joining here eh illinois
eh her research career has focused on issues concerning womens health and gender based biology
she is a fellow of aaas and a member of the national academy of sciences institute of medicine
please join me in welcoming vice president and chancellor phyllis wise to the podium to open this golden anniversary
[ applause ] phyllis wise somebody took good care of these proceedings from fifty years ago
its a real honor to be here in this overflowing room
i wonder whether were in fire code but thats thats okay
i wont say anything if you dont
um it is truly an honor to be here to uh welcome you to the fiftieth anniversary celebration of this wonderful conference with such a long and strong history
yknow um when i got this position i tried really hard to uh do a lot of homework on the university of illinois to learn about my new academic home and i must admit i did not come across the allerton conference so i must not have done homework enough to realize what a rich tradition was really started fifty years ago
um this conference really is an illustration of uh what can happen at a great university with a one hundred and forty five year history
uh the the story that you just told professor baser basar and uh what im learning tonight about all of this is truly amazing
i think its wonderful that it started out at allerton and it continues to be at allerton
i think its wonderful to know that sometimes traditions should be carried on because they hav are part of the richness of the experience
um you know i i just want to add tonight that uh im sure that this is the beginning of the next fifty years of this conference and though it wont get larger in terms of number that that is actually a good thing because sometimes the intimacy that you gather from having only a few hundred people cannot be replicated when you let it grow into thousands and thousands of people at the same time
so i wish you the very best in this conference
i am honored to be here to welcome you to it and i wish you the richest of ca discussions and and um new discoveries being discussed here
thank you very much for having me
[clapping] male now that we have the official opening of the confernece allerton conference we can uh eh continue with the program and eh and we have a very distinguished eh eh speaker eh to uh eh for this eh kick off evening and and this is something special
allerton conference for those of you who have attended in the past has always been for three days and all events were held out in monticello and because of this fiftieth anniversary we decided to eh have a kick off event here on campus and so that we can attract uh people who maybe normally would not have gone out to allerton
and eh and and we wanted to pick someone uh who is uh who will talk to the importance of this occasion
and eh im very pleased eh eh to eh have eh karl astrom from lund university of sweden eh to be the keynote speaker or the jubilee lecturer this evening
eh he is a world renown control scientist and engineer and educator and i can take a full hour actually to talk about his accomplishments his impact on the field not only on the control field but but but across the board and eh eh communications eh and and computing those that that are really the topics and areas that are covered aller at the allerton conference
so let me say just a a few brief eh words on uh karls background and and some of his achievements
as i said i wont be able to cover everything
he was educated at the royal institute of technology in stockholm
during his studies he worked on inertial navigation for research institute of national defense
after working for ibm research for five years he was appointed professor of the chair of automatic control at lund institute of technology or lund university where he established a new department
from two thousand til two thousand ten he was a professor at the university of california in santa barbara and he is currently back at lund university as a as a senior professor
uh he has broad interest in control including stochastic control modeling system identification adaptive control computer control and computer aided control engineering
he is listed in the isi isa highly cited and and he has the adarsh number three
for those of you who dont know what that means ask your neighbor but after the lecture
and uh two he has seven books and two of these books have received the prestigious harold chestnut textbook prize from the international federation of automatic control
and one of his papers on self tuning control which is very well known very well cited which was co authored with wittenmark eh again from lund university was selected for the ieee book on control theory
this was the millennium eh book on control theory twenty five seminal papers eh covering the period nineteen thirty two and nineteen eighty one
there were only twenty five papers that were picked eh er eh out of from a pool of thousands of papers and and this was one of those
eh he has several patents and one of them for automatic tuning of pid controllers which he holds jointly with with hagglund eh and that has led to substantial industrial production
eh karl is a member of the royal society royal swedish academy of engineering sciences and the royal swedish academy of sciences
he is a foreign member of the us national academy of engineering the russian academy of sciences and the hungarian academy of sciences
he is a fellow of ifac a life fellow of ieee and he has received many honors among them six honorary doctorates eh the nineteen eighty five oldenburger medal from the eh american society of mechanical engineers asme
the nineteen eighty seven quazza medal from the information federat eh international federation of automatic control ifac and and which is the highest medal that organization bestows on eh ehm eh scientists and engineers in the control field
the nineteen ninety ieee control systems award he is a recipient of and and also the nineteen ninety three ieee medal of honor which is the highest award of ieee which is the largest engineering organization in the world and the two thousand and two great gold medal of the royal swedish academy of engineering and in two thousand and three he was inducted uh into the process control of of fame
and uh please join me in welcoming karl to deliver the jubilee lecture
[applause] karl thank you very much tamer
i should also tell the students sitting there in the back there are a couple of seats up front
dont be shy but step forward and use these seats please
um its certainly a great honor for me to speak on this fantastic location of the celebration of the allerton conference
so i would like to thank you very much for inviting me to do this
and em tamer asked me to give a broad picture of control and i was brave enough to take this picture
there should actually be a sub line here saying a personal reflection so remember what im saying here are my personal views
theyre certainly not universal truth
so eh control has been around for a long time but it really started to grow in connection with the development of the industries
eh it was sometimes an enabling technology but one didnt recognize that there were lots of similarities between for example process control telecommunications flight control etc
and it became an engineering discipline in the nineteen forty eh and it has been developing very very rapidly
and today we have lots and lots of applications and also some very interesting challenges
eh there have recently been a couple of studies of broad pictures of control
for example the ieee control systems society has published a book called the impact of control technology which is available on the web and in connection with the year eh two eh two thousand there were a couple of books presented that gave a perspective of engineering and control uh in this century and i listed a few of them there and well come back to them later
one thing that has been a hallmark of the control community is a solid foundation
and ive always been wanting to have an illustration of this and by accident i found this in montreal this summer
this beautiful building here happens to be an insurance building in montreal
and you look at this beaut it was one of the most beautiful buildings in montreal
but this tower fell down because the foundations were not so good
they had put in wooden pillars in the ground and then they started to rot
so what im saying here even if you have a beautiful house unless the foundations are solid eh its gonna tumble down
so im very proud to say that this has been a hallmark of control and you will see this logo popping up here and there
ive called control the hidden technology
eh its widely used its very successful its seldom talked about except when theres a disaster you know
when a reactor blows up when the airplane crashes
and ive often been wondering why
and i think its much easier to talk about devices than ideas
its much easier to say will a computer fix that than the ideas that are behind it
and also i think we have something to blame ourselves for
we have been very bad at telling what control is to our fellow scientists and also em to our colleagues and to the general public
eh so therefore i have advised our students this is something that we have done badly and you in the next generation now have to do it
so i think intel did it very well with this sort of intel inside yknow
so we should have something like control inside
so that would be one symbol
and then we should remember yknow to keep the foundations okay
and if we do this things would be very well here in the future
so what will i do now well i have a very simple outline
i its exactly follows the title
the past the present the future and then i will do a little summary
so now lets do the past
eh control is a young field
ehm its a little bit older than the allerton conference
eh and em eh so its useful to think about this
we are not matured yknow
were a little bit more than teenagers but barely
eh theres been e early use of control in many fields
in governors for machines in process controls in vehicle control and communication
as i said before people didnt realize it was the same thing until we got the servomechanism theory around say nineteen forty nineteen fifty
and this had tremendous consequences
education on control spread like wildfire in all engineering education and i think everybody would have been proud a uh about this
but around nineteen sixty yknow about the time the allerton conference started there was a paradigm shift
and we got to tackle the second phase in control that i will talk a lot about
and i think what were experience now is the third phase
and im not so sure about this so thats why i put a question mark over there
so lets now do something
lets look at power generation
yknow you start to generate electric power and if you were using ac you wanted to generate it with constant frequency
the solution to this was that you introduced a turbine controller which is a classic watt governor that was eh yknow these two wheels start spinning around
if they go go eh if go fast you you eh reduce the amount of water thats coming in etc
the side effect of this is that whenever you use feedback you run the risk of instability
and that happened when people started to experiment with this so you need it to have stability theory
and there were a number of people that you can see in the bottom of the slide who contributed to this
there you see from from left to right you see maxwell who actually wrote one of the early papers of analysis of control systems routh a british mathematician stodola a swiss turbine engineer hurwitz a sw a swiss mathematician vyshnegradski a russian engineer and lyapunov
so there was a whole lo eh slough of people who were developing stability theory
lets move to another field process control
typical problem was a chemical process to keep temperatures to keep pressures etc constant
the solution to this was the pid controller
there were some nice side effects
we got an industrial communication standard consisting of plastic tubes of given dimensions and the agreement that you should propagate signals by pressures between three and fifteen psi
and then you had standard instruments and standard devices that you connected
course with the days communication standard eh its not too good and not too fast but at least it was a standard
we also got two new rules to tune the pid controllers
flight control
question is how to fly and one reason that the wright brothers succeeded was that they understood dynamics
and they designed an airplane that was easy to maneuver but was not terribly stable
many other people designed stable airplanes that were difficult to maneuver
em a side effect of this is that em its boring to sit there and stabilize an airplane
and you can see there on the plane up here em there is em eh sperrys son is sitting there and they put an autopilot on this plane and em eh th th the mechanic was walking on the wing to introduce a perturbation and you can see that its pretty close to the ground
so i in in around nineteen thirteen this autopilot won the prize for the most stable airplane at eh in paris
and ive taken this from the honeywell book
in that they say an interesting feature is the proximity to the ground laughing and down there on the left you can see the wright brothers and then you can see em eh minorsky who was a ship engineer eh who was very heavily involved in the interaction between stability and control
heres another field telecommunications
em the problem was how can you communicate over long distances and to do this you needed amplification
so you needed to make a good amplifier
we are not talking about nineteen twenty nineteen thirty
and their amp the amplifying device at that time was the electronic tube a pretty crummy device
it gave you amplification but it was non linear and it had time bearing characteristic
and then we had some brilliant people who we eh at bell labs invented the feedback amplifier
so what did eh it was done by black
and the idea was that how can you make a system out a bad component and the uh the answer was by using feedback you can actually do this
and you see this calculation down here for a feedback amplifier that eh if you if arrange a feedback in here you look at the the gain
its essentially if k is large the gain is large
these two terms disappeared and essentially rtwo over rone which are passive component
so that was the key idea of the feedback amplifier
of course again people run into stability problems
here they call it singing because this amplifier started to yknow this sort of sound you had here in the beginning with the microphone and the loud speaker
so therefore you had to do stability theory and there are two giants
bode who i was told grew up here in urbana and em eh his father was a professor here in classics or languages and there were harry nyquist who grew up in sweden
eh the reason why feedback is used so much that thats a tremendous power
you can make accurate system from imprecise component like you did in electronic amplifiers
you can reduce effects of disturbances and component variation like you do in process control
you can regulate stabilize and shape behavior
youre a fantastic properties
so what are the drawbacks drawback number one is risk for instability
and thats why stability has played such an important role in control engineering
yknow you really have to know you have to know your enemies
[laughing] the other thing about feedback is that you are feeding sensor noise into the system so that noise will create a lot of action that you would like to avoid
so these are the two drawbacks
but of course if you look to the advantages we have a lot of positive things going for us
so the scene of nineteen forty was widespread use of control in many fields and i gave you examples of this
i listed them there
the similarities were not realized
so what it took to to realize the similarities was essentially the second world war
so during the second world war what happened was that em politicians realized that science could have a major impact on the outcome of a war
and here in united states and in other places want organized laboratories around universities which were going to develop the m m military tools the radar etc
and of course very prominent here in the united states was the effort around mit
so i want to gunsights radar etc
so the concepts were to use feedback and feedforward
and what happened then is that they brought in people who had very different talents
they brought in people for example who new about autopilots
they brought in people from bell labs
they brought in people from the process control industry
and then people discovered we have actually been doing the same thing
and then control emerged
and em the eh design tools were block diagrams and transfer functions
the simulation tools were analog simulation
implementation was again that whenever you would have to build a controller yous you essentially using analog techniques
and at that time there was a holistic view of theory and applications
so essentially the same groups who were doing application were also doing theory
eh heres a little picture of servomechanism theory
eh the picture on the left illustrates em the block diagram which is a very nice way of abstracting away details from a technical system
the picture in the middle show a hardware in the loop simulation from the saab airplane company around nineteen fifty two and you see an analog computer sitting there on the right
the theory was laplace transforms and complex variables
system concepts feedback feedforward
design was frequency response a lot of graphical methods and then analog simulation and analog implementation
heres one of the early books on control
the reason its called servomechanism theory
and notice its written by a professor of physics from purdue
its written by an instrument engineer from an instrument company nathaniel nichols and a first rate abstract mathematician ralph phillips from eh university of southern california
cert its conception control was multidisciplinary with a strong footing in mathematics a strong footing in physics and a strong footing in instrumentation
the consequences of this were tremendous
we were getting e education of control engineers sort of
control courses sprung up everywhere
they came in different departments mechanical electric sometimes in civil engineering
eh we got organizations where the most prominent is ifac international federation of automatic control was founded fifty seven
eh there was industrialization
the company was specializing on control
like johnson control like honeywell
we got journals and we got conferences and i think today theres a control conference every week
i think every subject would have been proud of this and we are now come roughly to nineteen sixty
so in nineteen sixty i said we had a paradigm shift
and in my mind the driver was a space race
you know sputnik came up nineteen fifty seven generated a fantastic amount of activity
another thing that came around were the computers
so one started to use computers to solve control to implement control systems instead of using analog computers
and the first installation was i was in an oil refinery in texas in fifty nine
eh also it was discovered that the tools that were available at the time in nineteen sixty were insufficient
so what happened then we turned a lot to mathematics to bring in yknow new tools and new ideas
there was a rapid growth of s subspecialties optimal control stochastic control nonlinear control etc
we also got computational tools
yknow matlab today is a successor of what was developed at the time
there was a very impressive development of theory but the holistic view was lost
eh ive sometimes said at the time that em there were many professors of control who had a platonic view of control systems
they talked a lot about them but they never touched them
[laughing] and em that illustrates yknow the uh lack of the holistic view
eh ill give you a couple of examples
one of the most promising one eh p prominent one was optimal control theory
eh it was built on on eh classical results like by hamilton and euler
and then we had bellman who developed dynamic programming direct descendant of hamilton and jacobi
we had pontryagin who you can say his ideas were direct descendents of euler and lagrange
and today we have what you call model predictive control
a lot of this was driven by the space race
yknow you would like to shoot up a heavy satellite with a weak rocket you better do it in the right way
eh and here i just gave two books one by bellman and one by pontryagin
another very important thing that happened was the kalman filtering
and i put wiener right on the left because wiener filtering was the predecessor
in in many senses a lot of the machine was developed by him
and then kalman came along and found very efficient ways to filter signals and he could combine measurements with mathematical models to es to do estimation
so thats the basis of the kalman filtering
another thing is that we also got a new structure of the controller
instead of the controller being a black box we now saw that the controller should have a couple of components a kalman filter here that receives all the information from the process
it generates best estimate of the state
then we have here a feedforward generator that that generates both feedforward signal that drives the system where we would like it to go and also desire generates desired behavior of the state and then we just do state feedback up here
so that was something that we got out of the kalmans work and the kalman filtering
we also got system identification a methodology to get out mathematical models from experiments
this is data i made myself in a paper factory in the early sixty
we which we uh wanted to know how does a big factory behave from inputoutput and then you persuade the people to let you change things during production and you measure important variables in the end
and then based on this data you em eh you estimate mathematical relations between these ones
and the typical idea is that by by doing better control you can move closer to tolerances here and you can save money
so heres a tip one of the first experiments we did when we were controlling the thickness of paper accurately
it was a project that ibm was running together with the swedish paper mill
heres another area adaptive control
em one of the things eh it actually came up er from aerospace because when airplanes started to go supersonic the dynamics changed
and then it was not enough to have an autopilot with fixed settings so one tried to do an autopilot that could adjust itself to changing flight conditions
the early experiments were not too successful
there was a famous crash on the x fifteen for example
so the field has been going up and down and has continued to go up and down
eh one of the things ive been concerned with was called the self tuning regulator
eh there was a lot of theory developed
there were case studies
eh ive given here a couple of products that i will skip because of time
ill give you one example though
a ship steering autopilot
this was something we developed from my lab together with a local shipyard in kockums
and when i google this now the autopilot is still marketed by northrop grumman
and here i gave you an example
a typical autopilot runs a pid controller and here you see what is happening how the course is deviating when youre running in pretty bad weather and here you see what the rudder is doing
when we switched on the adaptive controller in here you see what happens to the course deviations
you dont have to do an analysis to see that this is better
the reason that the adaptive controller can do it here it knows about waves and its trying to estimate what the wave motion is
and you can also see we are not using larger rudder motions than what you are doing with the pid controller
thats a little bit more high frequency in here
so i would say that this is a very nice example of adaptive control that was done thirty years ago and the products are still here here running
one nice thing here is that you know quite a bit about ships so one can actual do a physics based initialization of the system
so if you know basic data about the ship you can roughly figure out what the initial parameters are going to be
em heres a special subject i will take up
because in the early phase of servomechanism people knew that there were limitations of control
people knew that time delays are bad
people knew that instabilities are bad
people know that what we call zeros in the right half plane are bad
when em the so called modern control theory came around with kalman filters and state feedback these conditions somehow did not show up if you looked upon the way people were looking about it
so then people say eh well yknow maybe these limitations are not so serious anyway
and eh uh i attended conference that were violent discussions yknow between the people who were advocating what was at the time called modern control theory and the classic guys
the classic guys were saying like this oh time delays are limitations
it must come into the theory
zeros in the right half planes are very bad
they must come in
and then the guys sitting there on the the modern control say oh yknow you guys are stupid
yknow you dont know about matrixes calculations like this
so we have this fantastic robustness property etc
well in the end so it was almost like religious battles yknow
so instead of sitting down and and asking trying out what the problem was and resolving it y you becam you got a religious fight that lasted for several years
so it took a long time to figure this out
and im very pleased to say that eh one of the first glimpses of what was going on was actually presented at the allerton conference by this man here which is called george zames in nineteen seventy nine
am i correct now yes seventy nine
so that was the first time it came up that theres probably something about the fundamental limitations about time delays
and then it took a while eh but the and of course what contributed to this was that state space had a i had infinite gain margin and phase margin of sixty degrees
of course that had to do with the fact that youre measuring all the state values
when you do output feedback this is not at all true
so then the field of robust control came around and youla who was very active here from the first allerton conference was one of the key contributors to this
and then there was a very famous paper thats called the four author paper by john doyle eh keith glover khargonekar and bruce francis
i couldnt find a good picture of bruce francis but he should be here
[laughing] and em it then it became very clear that there are indeed fundamental limitations
so yknow the classical guys were right about this
and also eh one figured out the way to solve this
then another thing happened here in illinois
eh you recognize our friend here and he had a colleague in france called pierre bernhard and they said well its all games
see in other words they formulated the robust control problem as a game problem
nature is providing the bad perturbations and what you are doing is that youre playing against nature
the very nice consequence of this is that it opened up the area to do robust control for nonlinear systems
the other approaches that were done before they were limited to linear systems
but now when you treat it as a game from a different viewpoint you could suddenly you could suddently tackle nonlinear problems you couldnt do before
so that was a little bit about the past
and i didnt dare to go f more than to roughly nineteen eighty because one of my colleagues who was a professor of history said never ever talk about recent things because youll never have a good perspective on them so i was brave when i went to nineteen eighty
i didnt want to go any further
so now ill talk about the present
and em eh about applications
there are lots and lots and lots of applications of control in the traditional fields and this application are expanding
so we have it in power systems in process control in aerospace in automotives in buildings and robotics
we have it in computer systems
we have it also at other levels
for example in global enterprise control
you have it in advertisement
you have it in mobile telephones
you have it in art and games and you have it in physics and biology
so not only the tra traditional fields are expanding but also the application fields are expanding
ill give ya ill give you illustrations of this
here is for example a process control example
its also something ive been involved with
a simple way to tune simple controllers
so theres a pid controller that you would like to tune what you do is set the switch in a relay here
then you get like a thermostat
and what happens with a thermostat the tempers starts to oscillate start to swing
well the swinging there contains useful information so by analyzing the swinging you can pick up enough information to tune a pid controller and then you can just switch it switch it over
its a robust and easy to use
its well adapted to users
you can just have a button that you push and its done by quite a large company at the time so there are hundreds of thousands of of these sort of devices out there today
i i gave you a nice example of this
this comes from em em a paper mill up in naven sweden
and em eh i wasnt there myself so i this is second hand story
so my my colleagues were up there
they had been a student of these controllers with automatic tuning
and typical commission a factory is something that typically takes a week or two
y yknow you have to fix up the instruments
you have to tune controllers etc
in this case they did it in three days
so what they did they make uh sure the instruments right
connect one of these autotunes and push a button
this loop is clear
go to the other loop
so people were very happy about this
so they said well cant you use this magic device on this beast of process we have here that we have not really been able to control
and this was a destination tower and ill show you here whats happening
eh time is running this way
its one of these old fashioned instruments
you see here its oscillating
and this is run under under pid control
eh well here uthm what is this this is ah roughly before launch
you put it control into manual and then the oscillation stopped
here at two o'clock in the afternoon they push the tuning button
they push a button
so now what whats happening here you have essentially the relay feedback
here in the beginning you are just measuring a little bit of noise and hysteresis and then you can see its not in a perfect sinusoidal iteration but its enough to pick out the dynamics
and of course here people are starting to get worried
it doesnt work
and in there the controller has figured out by itself that now i know what parameters are and i can regulate and then see how well it regulates
and this takes from two o'clock in the afternoon til what is it here eh its uh seven o'clock in the evening
so its a long time but ehit tuned successfully
so i think this is a nice little example of automatic tuning
heres a very different example
this is a comp ehh its a factory complex
eh again a paper factory
you have lots of manufacturing units and then you have storage tanks etc
and here the problem is to run the whole factory in a in eh a sensible way
eh this is work that was done by abb
and what they do is that theyve been doing mathematic and model of the whole thing
the model is partic complicate
its about er a few thousand variables
so what they do is that they estimate the state from sensors
then they run an optimization program and then they simulate
and at this stage they give commands to the people who are running the different units about how they are going to chan change production settings
some of the production settings are set there automatically
so its an example of em automation of of a more complex systems
em this then grew up
this would be typical process control
this would be the manufacturing system i was talking about
whats happening now is control is now creeping up together with the business systems
em so for example wal mart is one of the companies whos most skilled at dealing with this higher level here to keep yknow storage of things like this um at a low level
heres another example that comes from general electric
eh its whats called a trip optimizer
it has to do with how you should run freight trains effectively
eh and the trick to run freight trains is that you should try to you should arrive in the right time and you should avoid braking as much as possible
so what general electric has done is that they have applied optimal control and then they have made a nice implementation of a system
so they are using wireless links eh s so to on board computers so you can know what you are
there are maps you know what the terrain looks like
so if you are going to go up a hill you can go a little bit faster
when you go down etc
you shouldnt brake when you go down
and then they have done an integrated system like this that is run by the train operators
so this system is now eh in commercial operation
in automotive i think that deserves a special slide because automotive is a strong technology driver
yknow there are so many cars and the car companies are so powerful so they can get em cmi manufacturing companies to do things they may not otherwise be willing to do
so for example eh eh they persuaded intel and motorola to do the micro controller
in other words eh eh its a computer with built in a to d and d to a
and also right now eh the automotive industrys pushing the sensory industry very much so we are getting cheap accelerometers and cheap gyroscopes
and em i i it started with them engine control because it was impossible to satisfy the california emission standard without with with tradition means
so the only way to do this was to introduce feedback
so thats whats happened
and then once you started to get a computer into the car there were many opportunities to many other things
so then you one got cruise control
you got adaptive cruise control
today you get collision avoidance and you get traction control
and you get also line gade guided assistance
and also one is moving to traffic flow control
there was a very interesting project run at uh by university of berkeley on platooning of cars
em you wanted to eh get more throughput on the highway by shortening the distances between cars and then you were going to run them automatically with about yknow half a meter between them and then you can push through cars very quickly
you can say its a way of making trains out of cars but it was an interesting project
now heres em eh another one of this namely for for trucks
this is done by scania which is a swedish car company kth
so by running trucks close to each other here you can reduce a lot of the a air resistance between them
and in a modern k t car today there are about eighty you could say theres about eighty control systems or eighty eh microprocessors
and the way the automotive industry deals with complexity is that they buy the whole system
they buy the sensor
they buy the actuator
they buy the computer
and that was all right if you had em handful of systems
eh now when youre getting eighty of them where some of them may use the same sensory information its getting more complicated
so now theres a very strong push in the automotive industry to get an infrastructure where they can do this
theres also a problem about specifications because typical specifications here you write a little book in english about half an inch thick and they hand this to some of the manufacturers and say okay this is what i want
and then they send you an electronic book and say here it is
so the question is how do you verify this and how do you make sure that it works and of course it doesnt always work
so this is one of the areas where theres a tremendous need for systematic procedures
em heres another example
eh its em automotive powertrain control
eh and its a nice system done by honeywell which are selling to car manufacturers so that the car manufacturers can introduce optimizing control into cars
eh i think im going to skip this one
eh also mobile telephones
i think this is really interesting
em here is an example of a mobile telephone in the nineteen eighty
you see price
eh very expensive
and you take one today about thirteen dollars
the weight four kilograms
now its sixty kilograms
and if you look to the control loops there are about ten ten critical control loops in a phone
and then you multiply by the number of phones per year
so i in the mobile industry is actually leading in terms of number of control loops
so this is the number of control loops you have in mobile telephones per year
so they require some attention
you do frequency control
em you do power control and gain control
and mostly its fairly simple controls but you had to pay careful attention to them because you manufacture so many of them
there are actually six thousand people who work in mobile telephone technology right next to our university which is kind of interesting for us
em heres another area which i think should be of prime importance for this campus
youre going to get this super computer coming here
uh this super computer is generating a lot of heat
that you have to get you have to buy the electricity for it and then you have to supply the heating
so control of computing centers is becoming very important
and its both a matter of allocating the resources
eh you have a lot of jobs coming into the the cloud and then you have to allocate the resources in the computer system to deal with this in an efficient way
you also have to have to manage energy
and typically in the system you can lower the voltage by thereby yknow reducing the clock speed and youre reducing youre reducing power consumption energy
theyre quite interesting control problems to do this
and youre certainly going to get one of these problems here on campus which could be a very interesting test case
so they said the same thing about data management in computing centers
heres a somewhat unexpected things
it is about internet advertising
eh o one nice thing about the internet is that uh uh the idea is how should you design er an advertisement campaign
yknow youre putting in money to do this and this and that and you are expecting a certain outcome
eh a nice thing about the internet is that its very easy to measure the outcome quickly
em and em there is a company called advertisementinc originally
it was founded by a son of leuenberger who is one of our community
its eh out in palo alto
and they are doing systems like this
so they are doing systems to essentially automate a use optimization for inter internet advertisement and they are using the sort of typical tools that we have yknow modeling and feedback control
then i have to talk about art and games and i this slide is sort of violent
its done by young people
so i have to i had to stop
yknow they can look at many things at the same time
i would would like you to look at this
em this is done by raff dandrea eh who was at cornell who is now professor at the eth and em this is what he calls the chair
it starts like this and then eh it falls down and then it starts over again
this is in a museum in toronto
eh he has also done other things
so this is a eh a a nice piece of art
heres another one
i know there are people here who are interested in quadrocopters
so these are quadrocopters in switzerland
you see there roughly what they look like
and they are building pyramids
and of course this stones are lighter than what the egyptians had [laughing] eh but they certainly build quicker
so i think its interesting to see that control is now moving into the the art world
and em raff dandrea was also i im going to stop this one
you are not like my grandchildren because they all fall at the same time
eh he also participated very successful in the robocup where little robots were playing soccer together
so yknow they are running around there and trying to beat the other team
eh i think raff dandrea won the world cup twice or something like this
eh but this is not only games
the same team have done this with the same type of technology
its about em eh doing warehouses
for example when amazon is going to package books and send them to you
and what they have done is that by using feedback they have been able to use very simple devices and then they are using feedback to make very accurate motion based on this
so they are they are using the feedback feedback tricks and em eh they are not only playing games like this theyre also doing real things that are now making profit
eh this is called kiva systems and i think the company has now been bought by amazon
now the chair was in the national gallery of canada so i think its nice that control has made its made its mark there
em well control has also had impact in physics
and there are two people who have got the nobel prize in physics for control effort
the first one was a swedish engineer called gustaf dalen who invented the switch for lighthouses
yknow lighthouses when its dark you want to switch the switch on and when its light you will switch it off
and he had a very simple idea
he was using three polished metal bars and one black metal bar
when eh light is shining yknow the em the the black one e expands and then it was open like this and it revolutionized lighthouses all over the world
the second one is a dutch engineer simon van der meer who was working with this accelerators where you are sending particles around a circuit and he invented something called stochastic cooling
therere some in very interesting effects done right now in quantum and molecular systems
and on here i have to mention this one too about yknow i think im doing almost great with time i think yeah
eh yknow turbulence has always been a challenge in physics to explain turbulence
and eh i its governed by navier stokes equations
a nonlinear partial differential equations
and then people a long time ago they linearized the navier stokes equations around eh eh eh some behavior and then they analyzed how will the eigenvalues of the linearized motion behave when youre changing reynolds number
they found it was never unstable
so they couldnt explain it like this
so the rumor went along that you can never explain turbulence by linear theory
but then eh a couple of control theorists eh mohammed dahleh who is no longer with us unfortunately and bassam bamieh they did the following
they analyzed if you have perturbations in the world how do these perturbations propagate to the velocity field and they linearized this operator
and then they were analyzing the gain of that operator
i mean how much of the variations here propagated into the flow
and they got very nice agreement with eh how turbulence changes with reynolds numbers
so i think thats one one one area where system theory have contributed to yknow classical physics problem
then in in physics eh you use feedback in the large scales for adaptive optics
what youre essentially doing there is that youre reducing the variation that happens when the rate is going through the atmosphere and the speed of light is changing in the atmosphere
you get rid of this by feedback
the other area here is uh is uh in the nano scale
were using atomic force microscope to essentially look at surfaces in very details
and of course both systems depend very critically on efficient feedback systems
if you do for example a better feedback system here the biologists are looking at samples
could see a picture yknow five times faster than they can look before for example
up here you can get much sharper images
very clear what control would do here
biologys an interesting one
since im not a biologist em i heres a book called the way life works and it has seven chapters and eh one chapter is about feedback
and this is a quote from the book
that feedback is a central feature of life
the process of feedback governs how we grow respond to stress and challenge and regulate body temperature blood pressure cholesterol level
the mechanisms operate at every level from the interaction of proteins to to organisms so thats taken bonafide from this book
and yknow right now theres a lot of activity in systems biology and related fields
one tries to merge this
i personally think its a difficult thing to do eh but em its certainly a very worthwhile effort
so that was a little bit about the present
now what about the future i think we have some interesting challenges because em we are now starting to deal with complex networked systems
you can think about the internet itself for example
you can think about power systems
you can think about what youre talking about smart grids
when youre gonna yknow to to charge electric cars
youre going to use electric cars for storage
youre going to generate electricity in the houses etc
were also getting system that are called sensor and actuator rich
if you take a camera yknow camera with say ten me megapixels
eh if you then view this as a sensor it is a sensor which has a lot of information in it
and i would say that the systems we have now in control they can easily deal with say twenty one hundred variables twenty one hundred variables can deal with well
when were coming into this we need to think about systems in a very different way
and whats going to happen is that we are to break up the system
its no longer sufficient to have the central kalman filter that sits there and do everything
we have to have local feedback in the sensors
we if we have for example images we have to do a lot of work in the images themselves to pick out the relevant information
and this is a tremendous ch challenge
another thing thats popping up here is safe design of embedded system
i mentioned this problem about the car
when its specified something by a book in english its not easy to verify what you get this right
so this is a tremendous challenge that we have not solved
another one is autonomy and to do autonomy you need to do adaptation learning reasoning cognition etc
and then we have the applications throughout the field so i will elaborate a little bit about this
this is a picture i got from a friend of mine eh at em wright patterson air force base
it tells about flight control an evolution of automation to enable greater air vehicle capability
and you see what theyre striving for is that they are striving for a higher degree of autonomy
so they would like to have yknow vehicles that are much more autonomous than they are before
the same thing is happening out there in space
and um em adaptive control can play a small part of this but we have to bring in elements of learning and cognition in here which are not so easy to do if youre going to do it autonomously
there have been some interesting things done though
most of you have probably heard about the darpa urban challenge
yknow when you drive car on an air force bay out in california they should obey the california driving rules
and th you mix them up with other cars that are driving around
and eh there were a handful of cars who were fulfilling of the specification
um among them was this car here that was the winning car
and they have some elements of adaptation learning and connection
they have to have a lot of safety
they have to have diagnostics
if youre going to have real systems you also have to think about maintenance and reconfiguration
i should mention though at that already nineteen ninety five yknow thats long time ago seventeen years ago a german researcher named dickmanns was running a mercedes benz from munich to copenhagen on the german autobahn and eh they had an autonomous car with a lot of sensors on it
and of course the driver on the autobahn they had to sit there and also supervise it manually
and they recorded whenever they have to do manual interaction
but they could run ninety five autonomously already in nineteen ninety five which i think is quite remarkable
eh so my feeling is that eh and this is very subjective that i think we are moving into third phase
like i said the second phase was driven by the space race and by computers
now were driven by complex networked systems and applications in physics and biology
so these are some very strong drivers
and eh some things we have to have there
we have to have autonomy
we have to learn to deal with sensor and actuator rich systems
we have to learn how to do provable safe design and reconfiguration
now when you have the cars with a lot of computers in when you drive them in and you have to make a change of them something you must have a safe way to introduce changes in the system effectively
and i also think as control engineers what we have to do is that we have to recover the holistic view
eh i think what happened in the sixty wasnt necessary because if youre going to develop yknow new areas and new field there is no way but to dive into it yknow forget about the rest
dive into it an and develop the mathematics
and we still have to do this in many of this field but to serve the engineering world thats sitting out there we must also have people who have a holistic view of things and thats a major challenge that i will talk a little bit about
and eh if you take this nih study the engineer of two thousand twenty this is precisely what they are saying
that eh contemporary challenges er require a systems perspective
so we must make sure that were getting students with a broad systems perspective
im very pleased to see john barris here
so uh hes been advocating this for a very long time
in my view it is something like this
im pretentious enough to put control in the middle
doesnt matter what you put it
[laughing] eh then we have to have computing
we have to have communication
we have to mathematics
and out here we have the real world
and to do the system were talking about you must in some way grasp aspects of all of this
now its impossible for a single person to be good at all of this
but what we can do is im sure we can educate eh students who are very good at one of these fields and who know enough about these interfaces in here so that they can communicate and work effectively with the other specialists that are sitting here
and then of course we need to have some overall people in here
em eh eh i talk about some for example i think this this interface is real easy control and communication because in my mind its essentially the same stuff
but its taught in different departments by different people which i think is ridiculous
eh mathematics is the same
there is a couple of differences
communication the guys dont bother about time delays and we control guys are worried about time delays
but i think these are minor things
so i think we can do a lot both in terms of courses and other things t to merge these kinds of things together
eh im gonna talk a little more about s something
this is the easy interface
it only has to do with university politics
[laughing] but now you have a young vigorous chancellor here so i think uh you may have a chance to do something
eh i will talk about the computer science barrier
yknow here you have control and here you have computing
incidentally i borrowed this from bruce krogh at eh carnegie mellon
so what control engineers do they work with stability feedback ordinary differential equation moderate complexity and worry about robustness
and then they write a a simulink simulation
they throw this over to the computing guys
and they know about languages etc formal methods abstraction architecture
and then they take the simulating program and then they do some kind of software for it
and eh sometimes it works
sometimes it doesnt work
so whats happening here control engineers have to know a little bit more about computing
computing engineers have to know more about control
ill give you one example
in automotive now there is a communications device called the can bus which is a standard communication protocol in the cars
its a beautiful little protocol but it has one drawback
it has time delays and not only that it has very big time delays
and if i said that time delays are bad for control system very big time delays are really bad
so if this person who did the can bus had had a good introductory course in control i said just an introductory course in control that was good
he would have known time delays are bad
so this would not be
a good thing if youre gonna close control loops
its alright if youre gonna just raise your windows up and down but if youre going to close control feedback loops around there its not a good idea
so thats one example that could have been prohibited by good education
[laughing] i should also mention computing
and i still remember eh well you can start with vannevar bush
he said engineering can progress no faster than mathematical analysis on which its based
formal mathematics is frequently inadequate
a mechanical solution offers the most promise he was at mit and then he went ahead and built the mechanical differential analyzer that could solve about six ordinary differential equations
i worked for ibm research and my boss i was in the math department for a while my boss was herman goldstine
he built the first computer together with john von neumann
so he was chair in the math department
at one staff meeting he said this which ive never forgotten
when things change by two orders of magnitude it is not evolution it is revolution now you combine this with moores law you get a revolution every ten years
[laughing] so you recognize that computing power changes by two orders of magnitude roughly speaking every ten years
and thats why i have to exchange laptops every third year for example
and eh theres a tremendous potential
if you think about this yknow that youre gaining two orders of magnitude per ten years so theres a f fantastic potential
but we have not been able to capitalize on this in engineering productivity
and i think that is something to think about because there is something out there that we could probably do something about
i should also mention that what i call the physics barrier yknow
here is we have the real world
and there we have mass energy momentum and up here we have control
and i said before that block diagrams is very useful for control because that was what w people used to discover that autopilots was the same as process control
the block diagrams look the same
but we as control engineers have been brainwashing students with block diagrams over fifty years but and we use them for physical modeling but block diagrams are absolutely worthless for phy serious physical modeling because in blocks you have a causal connection
you have an input and you have an output
when it connect two physical systems you have bidirectional interaction and that is not captured by block diagrams
so so please if youre educate in control engineer say that theres something more than block diagrams okay ehthen ill talk about modeling and simulation
again a quote from this the engineer of two thousand twenty where they say that computer based design build engineerer will become the norm for most product designs accelerating the creation of complex structure for which multiple subsystems combine to form a product so in other words yknow modeling is simulation
and so this is not my world
i said most were personal
this is from a more authoritative source than me
ill give you a nice example of this
eh the major german car manufacturers i listed them here and their suppliers have standardized when it comes to doing climate control systems in cars
you know climate control it has um compressors it has heating changes it has pumps etc
and what they have done is that the supplier who supplies a hardware piece of hardware he also delivers a validated mathematical model of that
happens to be in a language called modelica
and then the car companies they are taking then this model eh so they say well uh maybe this p company here has a cheaper version of a compressor should i use it so then they take the the model from from this company they put it into their simulator and they run the typical eh european standard drive cycle and then they figure out what happens to power consumption to gasoline consumption what happens to quality no big deal so then we can buy the cheaper one
so i think this is a very nice illustration of em how you can use models
in this case the ip is protected by extensive en en encryptation and the substantial reduction here is in in road and climate chamber testing
and im very proud to say that this was done by eh some of my grad students who also have this company modelon who is doing this
eh actually the same technology was used by toyota when they made the prius
and the software was also done by one of my former phd students
toyota had at the time three hundred engineers working with mo with working with whats now called modelica
ok now come to the educational challenges
eh we have to educate the engineers who can deal with this in the future
we also have to educate people in physics and biology
and last year i actually gave a course in control to physicists based on the request from the physics department which was kind of fun
em and i think in control we have what i call the dilemma of emerging fields
yknow i said control is a very young field literal fifty years
so what did we do well we taught everything we knew
that was first course
when we knew a little bit more we made a new course
and then we made a new course and we made a new course and we made a new course
and right now there are simply too many courses eh because if were going to have these people who are well rounded and well educated we cant have them to do fifteen courses in control or i dont know what it is here to get a phd in urbana
we cant have them to because they also have to learn a little bit about communication about computer science and about about physics
so we have to do something about this
and the way to do this i think is to filter out the fundamentals to compress eh to compress figure out what are really the important things what are the essentials here and we have to do this at the courses to all the level
its a lot of work
particularly if you have your courses developed and are going to teach it
but i think in the long run its going to be very worthwhile
i also mentioned here computing
and i think computers have changed what we mean by a solution to a problem
yknow in the old time you had a solution if you can write it down with sine functions or something like this
and now t for example if something reduces to a a linear algebra problem its essentially solved
if something reduces to an ordinary differential equation with constant coefficient its also solved because we can generate everything we know with computers
so i think erh by thinking intelligent about this i think we can do this
and what we need is that we have to have students who have very deep knowledge in specific areas but who are reasonably broad in neighboring areas and also who are able to communicate and also to work in teams
this is what we need in order to do this
so now eh what ive done ive spoken about introduction past present and future
and now let me try to summarize
eh i think personally control is a very vital dynamic field
and if we watch out for the foundations and if we think about telling other people what we are doing eh i think we are going to continue to do great
eh there are lots of applications in traditional fields so engineers were educating here they can find lots of job out in the industry
now we have also have to deal with networked embedded systems
we have to deal with autonomy and safety
and i think we should take the educational challenge here seriously
we were discussing here during dinner for example that there are many changing modes of education right now and i think this may be some vehicle we can jump on to to do this
eh so what we should do is that we should continue to take care of the foundations and then to develop the holistic view
if we do this control will also be great in the future
thank you very much
[applause] man thank you karl for this inspiring eh lecture
i think we can take eh eh a couple of questions from the audience
when you have a big crowd its karl they are like swedish students
man yes thats right
yes
karl john john barras inaudible audience karl ah eh co could you could you repeat eh they wanted inaudible audience karl yeah inaudible audience karl i i will repeat i will repeat the question
eh t the question was that before we had a very simple situation
we had the sensor and an actuator and then we had the controller sitting between and maybe you had ten sensors and ten actuators but you have a block sitting there in between
and john asked what is happening right now when we have networked systems
and im trying here to pick up a little picture as an illustration
eh ah eh ill do it here
eh it should be uh i think it was somewhere down here
oh i think ill skip the picture
eh i think this will require new paradigms
i mean will we require yknow
my view is this
that i think it will requi require total different way of thinking
so so what you have to do is that you have eh eh you have to have a lot of eh eh eh well to be honest i dont really know what the solution is but clearly it requires a very different way of thinking than when you had for example ten sensors and ten actuators and then yknow some kind of computing box in the middle
so so thats why im saying yknow that control is by no means dead yknow
we have these problems that are very challenging which are sitting out there that we have to deal with where we dont know the solution
and thats of course great if your graduate student are looking for good problems
and its not going to be easy
inaudible audience karl yeah
uh so eh th the comment was that eh eh if you if you have information theory you have the problem bringing the information out to the network
so tha thats also a problem
so yes
i think you know eh both john and i will be out here eh so you can you can you can corner john then me to talk more about this later on so
inaudible karl no no
man well thank you karl
[applause] karl thank you
