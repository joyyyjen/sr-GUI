we are kicking off this evening a week to week long celebration the golden landmark events that led to the golden years of the ballot in conference on communication control and computing
for those of you who have been regular attendees at balancing conference for many years and for some probably allison it is special place in your career whipping presented your first paper or second paper in your career at the knowledge and confidence and i know that there are many of you out up there
for those of you for congress of the area first allison conference and then fall conference attendees and artists this is a historic moment
it's a celebration of that lol the discipline and scientific meeting which was launched fifty years ago on november fifteen ninety six to three with vision an incredible force
it was a blank alpha fun of them all and dark lord to get the job for us courts at the first conference the fifty years ago
milk cartons that glorious here than it is and then they if he was also involved in the initial discussions and letting go of the coffers and i believe he is the wallet won in this room for as a witness that is a given fifty years ago
that creates us vision was is that the collapse of mad but mac and jaw in the fourth of the proceedings of that first conference the
that vision was to provide an opportunity for researchers to present their fresh new results in a dynamic growing field and to bring researchers in different disciplines together to cultivate cost fertilization of ideas
and this was right on target
and thus far reaching vision off its father's he is still the guy didn't laugh at talent and fifty years later but
it's it's one of the longest running conferences at least that but i'm aware of in this isn't a nap and it's one of the most is the years but
it's perhaps the only the longest running conference that has never changed its venue
from the very beginning it it has been held at the allison house in monticello illinois
only a minor adjustment to assume it's been going from the first of the second ballot and confidence in ninety six of warp which was the work the day from the challenge mid november to late september are which was to damage and they took the third year
that's one that the second paladin conference will sell so that that the andes and and york the fall fall under the alex and arms and it looks lack the play some of the visible at that beautiful the wooden with us this year olds
an assault that i'm not sure that a lot that and that's that is that fact but the mac actually want to double the first day conference in the law burn the first week in october because that was sad book that coincided with is the thing which was a little more than fifty
but alex an awful not available at the plant and that's all that was the reason why it was forced to november the city
but then immediately the following year it was brought back to the first week or the last week in september and since then it has always been held either the last week in september or the first week in october
