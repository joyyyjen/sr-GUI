how are we doing
no no no not by that i meant how are we homo sapiens we'd doing as a species
a typical way to answer that question is this
you choose some measure of human physical well being
average longevity average calories per day average income overall population that sort of thing
and draw graph of its value over time
in almost every case you get the same result
the lions cameras along a low level for millennia and rockets up but financially in the nineteenth and twentieth century
or choose a measure of consumption
consumption and consumption fresh water is a
and draw graph of its value over time
in the same way the lines because along at a low level for millennia and rockets ah but financially in the nineteenth and twentieth century
biologists have a word for this outbreak
an outbreak is a population of species exceeds the bounds of natural selection
natural selection ordinarily keeps populations and species within roughly defined limits
s. era sites lack of resources prevent them from expanding too much
but every now and then a species escapes it's bounds
from a porn star fish in the indian ocean the mussels the great lakes freeze but we're here in canada
population exploded on triple a thousand people a million people
so here's a fundamental lesson from biology outbreaks in nature don't end well
put a couple of proto zola into a petri dish full of nutrients you
in the natural habitat soil or water
they're violent constraints them
in a petri dish the notion of breakfast and no natural enemies
they eat reproduce to reproduce and reproduce the bank
they hit the edge of the petri dish at which point they either drown their own ways dark mark of resources or both
the outbreak and always bad
from the viewpoint of biology you and i are not fundamentally different than the proto so in a petri dish
we're not special
all the things that we're vanity think makes a difference
art science technology and so forth
they don't matter
one outbreak species
we're going to the edge of a petri dish simple as that
well the obvious question is actually true
are we in fact do be a petri dish
i like to set aside this question from a ask you guys another one
if we are going is the biology how are we going to
in your twenty fifty per week almost ten million people of the war and also on the things you're not
nice cars and clothes nice homes the actual running
but the whole running for ten billion people are not do this
are we feed everybody get water to everybody provide power to everybody avoid the worst impacts of climate change
i'm a science journalist and i've been asking these questions researchers for years
in my experience their asses fall into two broad categories which i call wizards and profits
wizards techno whizzes believe that science and technology properly applied was produce our way of our dilemmas
be smart make more they say that way everyone can win
prophets believe close to the opposite
they see the world is governed by fundamental ecological prophecies the limits that we transfer to our peril
use less conserve they say
otherwise everybody is going lose
