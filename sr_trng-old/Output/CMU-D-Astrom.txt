we are taking off this they remained a week long celebration often landmark events which is the golden anniversary of the ballot in conference on communication controlling computing
for those of you who have being a regular attendees at balancing conference for many years and for some probably a pallet than this special place in new york area and then being presented your first date or or second bigger bigger barrier at balancing office and i know that there are many of you out there
for those of two phone this is the very first ballot in conference and then fall conference attendees and fog as this is a historic moment
it's a celebration of that malt the disciplinary a scientific meeting which was launched fifty years ago on november fifth a ninety six is a with vision an incredible force ah
it was the brainchild of mecca unwelcome work boat together with jokes those quotes share the first conference fifty years ago
bill parkinson's that glorious year mandate that and the new was also involved in the initial discussions and letting go of the golf pros and i believe he is though only won in this room who has witnessed that these are given fifty years ago
that creates as vision was bizarre to go like that meant my mac and join in the forward to the proceedings of that first conference
that's a vision was to vote like no fortunate to for researchers to present their first few results in a dynamic going to feel and fumbling we start trusting different disciplines together to cultivate coast fertilization of ideas
and this goes i don't target
and thus far reaching vision off its ponders is still the guiding light at the eller than fifty years like that
it's it's one of the longest one eight conferences that plays that kind of wear off in this isn't very out and it's one of the most is the idiots that
it's perhaps still only eight longest running conference that has never changed it's me and
from the very beginning it has been out alex and lost him on the cello illinois
only a minor adjustment was made it's been going from the first of the second ballot and confidence in ninety six civil war which was to motivate from that show where mid november so late september which was set them with ten days but the third year
that's one that the second ballot and how things worse now so that then then these can enjoy the beautiful full were there at the house and grounds and it looks like it's way some of the base will have that beautiful weather with us this year also
i'm salt bad i'm not sure so what's the extent that says is that fact but then mac actually want it to all the first day conference in all your route the first week in october because that coincided with that coincided with his birthday which little over the fifth
but that out an awful about the veil that that time and i'm told that was the reason why it was pushed the november than fifty
but then immediately the following year it was brought back to the first week for the last week in september and since then it has always been out either the last week and i'm both the first week in october
the conference's him all over the years in a barrel of the developments in the fields of communication controlling computing and in fact it has at times influence in fact that and shaped the emotions in those fields
some of the very early results which then became landmarks in these fields where present that it out and confidence
to share with you some numbers in nineteen six fifty eight at the very first conference their regular non technical sessions for the general or what we now call planet sessions there were not call that way at the time with six it to individual present patients involving they for office
the proceedings off that inaugural meeting was edited by joe close and it's gone five seven on that than eighty eight pages
and here i have actually a copy off that very first proceedings and it since i've had good shape fifty years later
and then the proceedings in the intervening years they've always looked like this
nothing is that
and then get a good day as compared with those initial numbers forty nine years later we have in the program this week six to five sessions three on that i'm forty four individual presentations and they will almost five hundred at all those maybe one or five pounds of authors are involved in these papers which will be present the theater
so it's a it's a major goes but we are limited by the size of ballots and all those so don't expect those numbers of goes to double within the next thirty one than ten years
so talking about then celebrations that said golden anniversary of ballots incompetence is not the only important anniversary run on our campus today
today is also that exact to the bay for zero anniversary of our chancellor phyllis why it's taking on this stewardship of our campus

thank you
some aid to care of the proceedings for fifty years ago
it's a real honour to be here in is overflowing wrong i wonder whether we're in a fire code but that's that's okay i won't say anything if you don't have to
it is truly an honor to be here to welcome you to the fiftieth anniversary celebration of this wonderful conference with such a long and strong history
you know when i got this position i tried really hard to do a lot of homework on the universe illinois to learn about my new academic home and i must admit i did not come across the elephant conference i must love john palmer enough to realize what you're rich tradition was really started fifty years ago
this covers really is an illustration of what can happen at every university with and for forty five year history
that says the story did you just told purpose of us here us are and what i'm learning tonight about all of this is truly amazing
i think it's wonderful that it started our ten and continues to be at our time
it's wonderful to know that sometimes traditions should be carried on because they have are part of the richness of the experience
and you know i i just wanna add tonight then i'm sure this is the beginning of the next fifty years of this conference and no you won't get a larger in terms of number that that is actually a good thing because sometimes the intimacy that you gather from having only a few hundred people cannot be replicated when you let it grow into thousands and thousands of people in the same time
so i wish you the very best and discovered
