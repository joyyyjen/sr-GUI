how are we doing 
no no no not by that i meant how are we homo sapiens we'd doing as a species 
a typical way to answer that question is this 
you choose some measure of human physical well being 
average longevity average calories per day average income overall population that sort of thing 
0 draw graph of its value over time 
in almost every case get the same result 
the lions cameras along at all levels for millennia 0 rockets up but financially in the 39 century 
or choose a measure of consumption 
consumption of energy consumption of rough water as a 
0 draw graph of its value over time 
in the same way the lines because along at a low level for millennia 0 rockets are but financially in the 39 century 
biologists have a word for this outbreak 
an outbreak is a population of species exceeds the bounds of natural selection 
natural selection ordinarily keeps populations 0 species within roughly defined limits 
pets are sites lack of resources prevent them from expanding too much 
but every now 0 then a species escapes it's bounds 
from a porn star search in the indian ocean zebra mussels the great lakes spurs but we're here in canada 
pa places explode a wonderful 4000000 people 
so here's a fundamental lesson from biology outbreaks in nature don't end well 
put a couple of proto zola into a petri dish full of nutrients you 
in the natural habitat soil or water 
they're violent constraints them 
in a petri dish the notion of breakfast 0 no natural enemies 
they eat reproduce the reproduce the produced a bang 
they hit the edge of the petri dish at which point the other drown their own way start to mock of resources or bo 
the outbreak ends always bad 
from the viewpoint of biology you 0 i are not fundamentally different than the proposal in a petri dish 
we're not special 
all the things that we're vanity think makes a difference 
art science technology 0 so for 
they don't matter 
1 outbreak species 
we're going to the edge of a petri dish simple as that 
well the obvious question is actually true 
are we in fact doomed to the petri dish 
i like to set aside this question from a ask you guys another 1
if we are going as the biology how are we going to 
in your 70 the almost 10000000 people of the war 0 also want the things you're not 
nice cars nice clothes nice homes the odd chunk of trouble running 
theta it will run for 10000000000 people or we do this 
are we to feed everybody get water to everybody provide power to everybody avoid the worst impacts of climate change 
i'm a science journalist 0 i've been asking these questions researchers for years 
in my experience their asses fall into 2 broad categories which i call wizards 0 profits 
wizards techno was is believe that science 0 technology properly applied was produce our way of our dilemmas 
be smart make more they say that way everyone can win 
prophets believe close to the opposite 
they see the world is governed by fundamental ecological prophecies the limits that we trans grass to our peril 
use less conserve they say 
otherwise everybody is gonna lose
