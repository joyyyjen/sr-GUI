how are we doing
no no no no but that i meant how are we homo sapiens we'd chewing as a species
the typical way to answer that question is this
each use some measure of humans the call well being
average longevity average calories per day average income overall population that sort of thing
and draw graph of its value over time
in almost every case you get the same result
the lions cameras along an allowable for millennia and rockets up but financially in the nineteenth and twentieth century
or choose a measure of consumption
consumption of energy consumption fresh water is up
and draw graph of its value over time
in the same way the lines get along at all for millennia and rockets up accidentally in the nineteenth and twentieth century
biologists have a word for this outbreak
an outbreak is one population of species exceeds the bounds of natural selection
natural selection ordinarily keeps populations in species within roughly defined limits
best era sites lack of resources prevent them from expanding too much
but every now and the species escapes it's bounds
from a porn star search the indian ocean zebra mussels the great lakes spurs but we're here in tampa
populations explode hundred fold thousand fold a million fold
so here's a fundamental lesson from biology outbreaks in nature don't end well
put a couple of proto been to a petri dish full of nutrient grew
in the natural habitat soil or water
their environment constraints them
in the petri dish they have an ocean of breakfast and no natural enemies
they eat reproduce and reproduce and reproduce still bang
they hit the edge of the petri dish at which point they either drown in their own way starve from lack of resources or both
the outbreak ends always bad
from the viewpoint of biology you and i are not fundamentally different than the proto the petri dish
we're not special
all the things that we in our vanity think make is different
art science technology and so forth
no matter
one outbreak species
we're going to the edge of the petri dish simple as that
well the obvious question is this actually true
are we in fact doomed to hit the petri dish
i like to set aside this question for moment and ask you guys another one
if we are going to stay biology how are we going to
in your twenties fifty per week almost ten billion people on the war and all to warrant the things you're not
nice cars must close nice homes the actual total running
but the whole running for ten billion people are really do this
are we feed everybody get water to everybody provide power to everybody avoid the worst impacts of climate change
i'm a science journalist and i've been asking these questions to researchers for years
in my experience their answers fall into two broad categories which i call wizards and prophets
wizards techno whizzes believe the science and technology properly applied us produce our way of our dilemmas
be smart make more they say that way everyone can win
prophets believe close to the opposite
they see the world is governed by fundamental ecological prophecies with limits that we transfer to our peril
use less conserve they say
otherwise everybody is going to lose
