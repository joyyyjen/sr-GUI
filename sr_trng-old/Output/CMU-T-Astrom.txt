we are kicking off this evening a week long celebration of a landmark events which is the golden anniversary of the ballot in conference on communication controlling computing
for those of you who have been a regular attendees at balancing conference for many years and for some probably a pallet than it is special place in your career having presented your first paper or second paper in your career at balancing conference and i know that there are many of you out of there
for those of you for whom does the very first ballot and confidence and and fall conference attendees and far this this is a historic moment
it's a celebration of that multi disciplinary scientific meeting which was launched fifty years ago on november fifteenth nineteen sixty three with vision and incredible force i
it was the brainchild of maximal number who can get the joke post co chairperson first conference fifty years ago
bill parkinson's that hu is here man it's it and then he was also involved in the initial discussions and planning of the conference and i believe he is the only won in this room who has witnessed that historic event fifty years ago
that creates as vision was as at the light the magpies mac and jaw in the or to the proceedings of that first conference
that vision was to provide an opportunity for researchers to present their fresh new results in a dynamic growing field and to bring researchers in different disciplines together to cultivate cost fertilization of ideas
and this was right on target
and thus far reaching vision of its founders is still the guiding light at the ballot and fifty years later
it's it's one of the longest running conferences at least that but i'm aware of in this isn't the area and it's one of the most is the jews
it's perhaps the only the longest running conference that has never changed its venue
from the very beginning it has been held the salad the house in monticello illinois
only a minor adjustment was made in going from the first to the second ballot in conference in nineteen sixty four which was to move the data from the chill and mid november too late september which was september twenty eight through the thirtieth
that's one that the second ballot and conference will sell so that the attendees can enjoy the view fall fall or the talent and arms and the club slack if the some of the baseball at that beautiful with them with us this year olds
i'm told that i'm not sure to what extent that says is that fact but then it mac actually wanted to hold the first egg conference in october the first week in october but because that coincided would have coincided with his birth date with which was october fifth
but the al at the house was not available at the time and i'm told that was the reason why it was pushed the november that fifty
but then immediately the following year it was brought back to the first week or the last week in september and since then it has always been held either the last week in september or the first week in october
the conference has evolved over the years in pal of the developments in the fields of communication control and come to and in fact it has at times influence in fact the handshake the evolution is in those fields
some of the very early results which then became landmarks in these fields where presented at balance and confidence
to share with you some numbers in nineteen sixty three at the very first conference there were eleven technical sessions three general or what we now call planet sessions they were not call that way at the time with six and two individual presentations involving a tip for authors
the proceedings of that inaugural meeting was edited by joe cruise and it's comprise seven hundred and eighty pages
and here i have actually a copy of that very first proceedings and it's been such a good shape fifty years later
and then the proceedings in the intervening years i'm always looked like this
nothing has changed
and then end they as compared with those initial numbers forty nine years later we have in the program this week sixty five sessions three hundred and forty four individual presentations and have almost five hundred authors maybe one or five hundred authors are involved in these papers which will be presented here
so it's a it's a major growth but we are limited by the size of ballots and house so don't expect those numbers to grow to double within the next the one that ten years
so talking about the celebrations this egg golden anniversary of ballots and confidence is not the only important anniversary on on our campus today
today is also the exact to the day first year anniversary of our chancellor phyllis wise taking on the stewardship of our campus
we are delighted and honoured to have her here with us this evening to share with us has been for the mormon and to officially opened this kickoff event for the golden years
chancellor was also hold the position of vice president of the university of illinois and as ceo of our campus she is responsible for all financial programs campus policies and priorities with the mission of ensuring it has four months of educational experience for america's next generation of leaders
she has helped that faculty and an is that the appointments in the universe the washington the universe of california at davis and connecticut and prior to joining here and illinois
and for research career has focused on issues concerning women's health and gender based biology
she is a fall off to college us and that none of the national academy of sciences is to the men's
please join me in welcoming vice president and chancellor for this was the podium to open this golden how
what
the region of the here and has over fifteen years ago
it's a real honour to be here in this fall for flowing and are worried by air but that's that's okay i will say anything that you don't
the us china actually hear it you go new to the fiftieth anniversary celebration of this wonderful conference with such a long and strong history
you know what this position and tried really hard to do a lot of homework commuters easily to learn about one new academic calm if i'm asking an not come across the hall and that's the the award enough to realize we're rich tradition was really started fifty years ago
this conference really is an illustration what can happen at a free university with the forty year history
the the story is told in front of us here have happened what i'm learning didn't have all of this is truly amazing
i think it's wonderful that it started with alex and continues to be a challenge
it's wonderful to know that sometimes traditions to be carried on because they have park part of the richness of the experience
the ally and just one at a man short this is the king of the next fifty years to this conference and knowledgeable get a larger in terms of number that that's actually a good thing because sometimes the intimacy that you gather from having only a few hundred people cannot be replicated when you let it grow into thousands thousands of people think
silence is a very fast and run
and i wish you knew too much unless you can purchase the discussions and
and new discoveries the faster
thank you very much for having me
not that we have the official opening of the conference salad and confidence we can that man can deal with the program and the family of a distinguished the the speaker and who has done is done for this at kickoff evening and and the something special
