we are kicking off this evening week to week long celebration of a landmark event which is the golden anniversary of the ballot in conference on communication controlling computing
for those of you who have been a regular at the end is a paladin conference for many years and for some probably a talent than it is special place in your career having presented your first paper or second paper in your career at balancing conference and i know that there are many of you out of there
for those of you for whom this is the very first ballot in conference and and fall conference attendees and for our guests this is a historic moment
it's a celebration of that multi disciplinary scientific meeting which was launched fifty years ago on november fifteen nineteen sixty three with vision an incredible force i
it was the brainchild of mac them all hamburg who together with joe cruise coach eric the first conference fifty years ago
bill perkins who is here man it's it and then he was also involved in the initial discussions and planning off the conference and i believe he is the only won in this room who has witnessed that historic event fifty years ago
that creates as vision was as articulate that mad by mac and joe in the forward to the proceedings of that first conference
that vision was to provide an opportunity for researchers to present their fresh new results in a dynamic growing field and to bring researchers in different disciplines together to cultivate cost fertilization of ideas
and this was right on target
and thus far reaching vision of its founders is still the guiding light at the ballot and fifty years later
it's it's one of the longest running conferences at least that i'm aware of in the systems area and it's one of the most prestigious
it's perhaps the only the longest running conference that has never changed its venue
from the very beginning it has been held the salad the house in monticello illinois
only a minor adjustment was made in going from the first to the second ballot in conference in nineteen sixty four which was to move the data from the chill and mid november too late september which was september twenty eight through the thirtieth
that's one that the second ballot and conference was that so that that then these can enjoy the beautiful fall or the talent and arms and it looks lack typically some of the base will have that beautiful with them with us this year also
i'm told that i'm not sure to what extend that city is that fact but the mac actually wanted to hold the first egg conference in october the first week in october but because that coincided would have coincided with his birthday which was october fifth
but that i'm house was not available at the time and i'm told that was the reason why it was pushed the november the fifteenth
but then immediately the following year it was brought back to the first week or the last week in september and since then it has always been held either the last week in september or the first week in october
the conference has evolved over the years in pal of the developments in the fields of communication controlling them to and in fact it has at times influence in fact the handshake the evolution is in those fields
some of the very early results which then became landmarks in these fields where present to a ballot and confidence
to share with you some numbers in nineteen sixty three at the very first conference there were eleven technical sessions three general or what we now call planet sessions they were not call that way at the time with six and two individual presentations involving a tip for authors
the proceedings of that inaugural meeting was edited by joe close and it's comprise seven hundred and eighty pages
and here i have actually a copy of that very first proceedings and it is in such a good shape fifty years later
and then the proceedings in the intervening years i'm always looked like this
nothing has changed
and that and they as compared with those initial numbers for the nine years later we have in the program this week sixty five sessions three hundred and forty four individual presentations and have almost five hundred authors maybe one or five hundred authors are involved in these papers which will be presented here
so it's a it's a major growth but we are limited by the size of talent and cause so don't expect those numbers of iraq to double within minutes the one that has years
so talking about that celebrations this egg golden anniversary of ballots and confidence is not the only important anniversary on our campus today
today is also the exact to the day first year anniversary of our chancellor phyllis wise taking on the stewardship of our campus

this conference really is an illustration what can happen at three universities listen to forty year history
