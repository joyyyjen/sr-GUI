are you going
then on out i buy them and how are we homo sapiens we are doing is a species
i took away the answer that question is this
you choose some measure of human physical well being
and longevity average calories per day average income overall population that's that
and draw graph of its value over time
in almost every case you get the same result
the winds gators along in low-level for millennia and rockets up exponentially in the nineteenth and twentieth century
or she is a measure of consumption
consumption of energy consumption for far as i
and draw grass and its value over time
in the same way the lines there is a long been a low level for millennia and rockets are exponentially in the nineteenth and twentieth century
biologists award for this outbreak
an outbreak is on population species the seeds of bounds in memphis life
but what you ordinarily keeps populations of species within roughly five minutes
s. parasites lack of resources prevent them from expanding too much
but every now and then the species the states it's pounds
from one starfish in the indian ocean zebra mussels the great whites spurs but we're here in canada
ah who's low hundred four thousand four million people
so here is a fundamental lesson from biology outbreaks in nature don't end well
what a couple of chromosome into a petri dish full of new treatment
in a natural habitats were waters
they're my constraints that
in a petri dish notion of breakfast and no natural enemies
they can't read the news in reproduce it for this about that
the he and a petri dish at which point the eyebrow miller only start my resources or both
the outbreak yeah mm is always bad
not from the viewpoint of biology you when i are not fundamentally different than a proposal in a petri dish
we're not special
all the things that we are granted you think maybe it's different
art science technology and so forth
no matter
wow bird species
would you to the to get some clothes that
well the obvious question is actually true
are you that you get into that
let's set aside this question for much as he dies another one
if we are going is the biology how to do it
in the year twenty fifty per week almost ten million people in the world and also a whole lot of things you're not
nice cars nice clothes nice homes yeah i took a toll road
i think a toll running for ten billion people are into this
pharmacy everybody did want everybody provide power to rebut avoid the worst impacts of climate change
i'm a science journalist and i guess who's questions researchers for years
in my experience their asses fall into two broad categories which i call wizards and profits
wizards to with his believe that science and technology properly applied list producer way on or limits
the smart make more they say that way everyone can win
profits league's most idiotic
they see the world is governed by fundamental ecological prophecies with limits the winter and grass to work parrot
use less conserving say
otherwise everybody's gonna lose
