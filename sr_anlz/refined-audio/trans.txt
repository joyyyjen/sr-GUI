go do you hear
but in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight
at this moment the whole soul of the old man seemed centred in his eyes which became bloodshot the veins of the throat swelled his cheeks and temples became purple as though he was struck with epilepsy nothing was wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry
and the cry issued from his pores if we may thus speak a cry frightful in its silence
d'avrigny rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful restorative
d'avrigny unable to bear the sight of this touching emotion turned away and villefort without seeking any further explanation and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws us towards those who have loved the people for whom we mourn extended his hand towards the young man
for some time nothing was heard in that chamber but sobs exclamations and prayers
what do you mean sir
oh you rave sir exclaimed villefort in vain endeavoring to escape the net in which he was taken i rave
do you know the assassin asked morrel
noirtier looked upon morrel with one of those melancholy smiles which had so often made valentine happy and thus fixed his attention
said morrel sadly yes replied noirtier
the old man's eyes remained fixed on the door
asked morrel yes
must i leave alone no
but can he understand you yes
gentlemen he said in a hoarse voice give me your word of honor that this horrible secret shall forever remain buried amongst ourselves the two men drew back
my father has revealed the culprit's name my father thirsts for revenge as much as you do yet even he conjures you as i do to keep this secret do you not father
morrel suffered an exclamation of horror and surprise to escape him
the old man made a sign in the affirmative
it was something terrible to witness the silent agony the mute despair of noirtier whose tears silently rolled down his cheeks
but he stopped on the landing he had not the courage to again visit the death chamber
the two doctors therefore entered the room alone
noirtier was near the bed pale motionless and silent as the corpse
the district doctor approached with the indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face and just unclosed the lips
the nearest said the district doctor is a good italian abbe who lives next door to you shall i call on him as i pass
d'avrigny said villefort be so kind i beseech you as to accompany this gentleman here is the key of the door so that you can go in and out as you please you will bring the priest with you and will oblige me by introducing him into my child's room do you wish to see him
i only wish to be alone you will excuse me will you not
i am going sir and i do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be more fervent than mine
